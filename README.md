# Kalterkrieg-Archive
This copy of the build always reflects the last publically available version of Kalterkrieg. That is currently `0.1.2`.

To use, download and put in your HoI4 mod folder. Then, run either descriptorSetupWin.bat or descriptorSetupUnix.sh depending on if you are using Windows (Win) or Mac/Linux (Unix).

If you’re on Windows and get an error that says “Linux tools (sh) not found”, ignore it, you’ll be fine without them.

Once you’ve run one of those two scripts, the mod should appear in your mods list. Add the mod to a playlist, toggle it on, and you are good to go!
 
Start up HoI4 and enjoy!
