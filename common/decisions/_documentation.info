COUNTRY DECISIONS

Decisions are made available to countries that fulfill the right conditions.
Some triggers are only checked once per day, once per frame or once per game.

allowed:
- Scope: THIS = Country
- Checked once per game at start (or when save is loaded)
- Used to filter out decisions that will never be available to a given country (usually checks original_tag = XXX)
- Important to use on performance-heavy decisions (especially targeted decisions) to avoid unnecessary computations

visible:
- Scope: THIS = Country, FROM = Country/State (if targeted)
- Checked each frame when the interface is refreshed if allowed was true
- Used to filter out decisions that should appear in decision interface (they may still be greyed out, see 'available' next)
- Caveat: this trigger can become performance heavy for targeted decisions, see 'target_root_trigger' and 'target_trigger'.

available:
- Scope: THIS = Country, FROM = Country/State (if targeted)
- Checked each frame when the interface is refreshed if both allowed and visible were true
- Used to indicate if a visible decision can be taken right now and it not, what the player should do to be able to.
  No condition should be impossible to match at this point (for example, do not require completion of locked out focus)

target_root_trigger:
- Scope: THIS = Country
- Checked once per day (updated in one of the 24 hourly ticks depending on country), if allowed was true
- Used to lessen the impact of targeted decisions that cannot be restricted by 'targets' and 'allowed'.
  Since targeted decisions are checked against each state/country in the game each frame in the 'visible' trigger, this offers a way to do a pre-check once a day.
  This trigger should be a subset of the 'visible' trigger that only uses the acting country scope.

target_trigger:
- Scope: THIS = Country, FROM = Target Country/State
- Checked once per day for each state/country in the world if both allowed and target_root_trigger were true.
- Used to select which country/states this targeted decision should apply to. Each match will create a dedicated decision entry.
- Similarly to target_root_trigger, this should contain a subset of the 'visible' trigger that pertains to a given target state/country.
  The lower frequency of this check will help avoiding checking the visible trigger against each country/state each frame when possible.

{Country Tag}_{Short Title} #{Optional Comment About the event} = {
    icon = {Icon fiting of the effect}

    allowed = {
        - in cases where the decision is supposed to be used by this tag or any tag spliting from it
        original_tag = {Country Tag}

        - in cases where the decision is only for the specific tag
        tag = {Country Tag}
    }

    visible = {
        - cases who make the event visible
        - generally uses triggers tied to unlocks, e.g: has_completed_focus, has_country_flag
    }

    available = {
        - cases to allow the decision to be selected
        - generally used when a country needs to be in a spesific situation that can change
    }

    - makes the decision one time
    fire_only_once = yes

    - number of days for the decision to be removed, any defined modifiers will apply in this time
    days_remove = {int number}

    - number of days for the decision to become visible again, only applies if fire_only_once = yes is not set or = no
    days_re_enable = {int number}

    - pp cost of a decision
    cost = {int number}

    - used when the cost wanted is more complex than pp
    - the text is what is displayed at the right with icons to show the cost, text defined in decisions_l_english
    - removal of the resources must be done in complete_effect
    custom_cost_text = decision_cost_{material and number needed}

    - trigger like available used for the resources of the custom cost
    custom_cost_trigger = {
        - trigger for the resources
    }

    - effect happening instantly when chosen
    complete_effect = {
        log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision complete {Decision Title}"
        hidden_effect = {
            - effect that need to be hidden
            - any custom cost should be here as well
        }
    }
    
    - effect happening when the amount of days in days_remove has passed
    remove_effect = {
        log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision remove {Decision Title}"
    }
}
