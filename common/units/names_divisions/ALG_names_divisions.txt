		# This list covers both the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and Australian Imperial Force (AIF) infantry divisions either extant during the interwar years or raised during the war.  It'd be possible to split the lists in two (CMF and AIF divisions having their own list, as CMF divisions only served in Australia and Australian territories (or thereabouts) but that's probably overkill, given they all had the same naming convention - probably makes more sense for the player in-game to have their militia and infantry divisions use the same name list, as far as I understand the system).
		# Australia only raised 12 infantry divisions historically.  This list is longer to avoid things like the 22th Infantry Division for Australias that build lots of divisions.
