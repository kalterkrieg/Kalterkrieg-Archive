#Fighters#
 CAL_fighter_equipment_0: "Curtiss P-40 Warhawk"
 CAL_fighter_equipment_0_short: "P-40 Warhawk"
 CAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "A staple of the Second American Civil War's entire duration, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk saw service by both New English and Pacific forces due to a licensing agreement with Boeing. While it would quickly be superseded by the North American P-51 in immediate frontline roles, the P-40 maintained its status as a workhorse patrol aircraft until the ceasefire."
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Grumman F4F Wildcat"
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "F4F Wildcat"
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "While in short supply during the beginning of the Second American Civil War, the F4F nonetheless maintains a place in history due to its importance on inspiring later designs and developing carrier tactics. The PSA's 'Langley' and Federalists' 'Ranger' were the only two warships to use these in a combat role."
 CAL_fighter_equipment_1: "North American P-51 Mustang"
 CAL_fighter_equipment_1_short: "P-51 Mustang"
 CAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The North American P-51 Mustang maintains a venerated position among the pilots of the PSA, with many of them crediting it for their successes in the skies over the Rocky Mountains. The plane proved so successful in a bomber escort and air supremacy role that the American Union State adopted a reverse engineered version, based on earlier versions of the P-51." 
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Northrop-Grumman F6F Hellcat"
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "F6F Hellcat"
 CAL_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The Northrop-Grumman F6F Hellcat stands as an example of trans-American cooperation, with both design bureaus of the Northrop and Grumman corporations cooperating to design a modern carrier fighter towards the end of the Second American Civil War. While these aircraft never saw combat beyond patrols off New England and the PSA, they have been noted by observers to be quite an improvement on older designs."
 CAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Lockheed P-38 Lightning"
 CAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "P-38 Lightning"
 CAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The Lockheed P-38 Lightning, or 'double fighter' as it was known by AUS pilots, was designed to allow for long-range escort and patrol operations in areas where few airfields could exist, such as the Rocky Mountains. During the course of its existence, it was found to excel at high-altitude interception, performing admirably in this role during AUS bombing offensives." 
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_1: "Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_1_short: "F-80 Shooting Star"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_1_desc: "The Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star represents the first true PSA foray into jet aviation, with a number of lessons learned from foreign observation and domestic tests being implemented into an interceptor airframe. The objective of this design was to intercept AUS bomber fleets coming over the Rockies, with bases placed strategically along the 'Eastern Wall' to allow for easier interception."
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "North American F-86 Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "F-86 Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "If the F-80 represents the first foray into jet warfare, the North American F-86 Sabre is a leap forward in jet design. Revolutionary technologies allow for far greater flexibility than possible in propeller-driven aircraft, with the adaptable airframe being able to accomodate various roles with relative ease. Foreign observers rate the F-86 as one of the finest aircraft of the period, even compared to German or Canadian designs."
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "North American FJ-2 Fury"
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "FJ-2 Fury"
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "A conversion of the F-86 Sabre for carrier duties, the North American FJ-2 Fury is as cutting-edge as its land-based counterpart, barring some teething pains in establishing practices for jet-based carrier aviation. Swept wings, modified landing gear, and a longer landing strut allow for the Fury to land on propellor-designed carriers with only minimal issues." 
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_2: "Northrop F-89 Scorpion"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_2_short: "F-89 Scorpion"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_2_desc: "The first intentionally-designed interceptor in the PSA's arsenal, the Northrop F-89 Scorpion was made to do one thing- eliminate AUS bomber fleets hypothetically streaming over the Rockies. Its design is meant to accomodate as many armaments as possible to accomplish this goal, including permanently fitted external fuel tanks for range."
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "North American F-86D Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "F-86D Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "A broad-based development from the F-86 Sabre, the F-86D is in effect a wholly new fighter- new parts, materials, and technologies developed after lessons learned from early F-86 deployments allow the lauded fighter to maintain its place among the world's militaries."
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "North American FJ-4 Fury"
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "FJ-4 Fury"
 CAL_jet_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Similar in scope to the F-86D Sabre in the USPAF, while the FJ-4 Fury maintains superficial and layout similarities to the earlier Fury family, wing design and fuselage developments have greatly improved its capabilities in carrier operations. With newly developed landing gear, increased fuel capacity, and a more comfortable cockpit, the FJ-4 allows for an all-weather interceptor to protect the USPN's carrier fleets across the Pacific."
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_3: "Convair F-106 Delta Dart"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_3_short: "F-106 Delta Dart"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_3_desc: "A development of the lackluster F-102 Delta Dagger, the F-106 is the PSA's response to bomber developments worldwide- a world-record setting high-speed interceptor, designed to bring down bombers in record time to prevent them from reaching the PSA's heartland. However, the Delta Dart also maintains a status as a competent air-to-air fighter, capable of going toe-to-toe with designated fighter aircraft."  
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_3: "North American F-100 Super Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_3_short: "F-100 Super Sabre"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Developed as a supersonic day fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre is an advanced replacement for the F-86s which dominated the PSA's fighter force. While it makes extensive use of technological and munitions developments to fill the fighter role, it also acts as a competent fighter-bomber, with strike munitions as part of its standard package list."
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_4: "Lockheed F-12 Archangel"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_4_short: "F-12 Archangel"
 CAL_jet_interceptor_equipment_4_desc: "A revolutionary supersonic aircraft designed for unprecedented interception speed, the Lockheed F-12 Archangel can be broadly considered a pinnacle of interceptor design- capable of Mach 3 flight and previously rarely possible flight ceilings. The F-12 Archangel also boasts one of the first reduced radar cross-sections, which while rudimentary, gives it even more reason to laud its technological advancements."
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_4: "Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_4_short: "F-5 Freedom Fighter"
 CAL_jet_fighter_equipment_4_desc: "The Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter is the PSA's answer to the AUS F-4 Spectre- a low-cost, multirole fighter with cutting edge aerodynamics and a small stature that give it a niche where other fighters might fail. The F-5 was designed from the ground up to be able to engage in numerous roles as a light fighter and be capable of conducting operations in nearly any terrain, something PSA planners highly desired given rapidly changing combat spaces."
 
 #CAS/Strike Fighters#
 CAL_CAS_equipment_1: "Republic P-47 Thunderbolt"
 CAL_CAS_equipment_1_short: "P-47 Thunderbolt"
 CAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "A design leased from the New Englander Republic Corporation, the P-47 saw most of its use late into the conflict and in the immediate aftermath as a good patrol aircraft. Designed around the Pratt and Whitney Double Wasp Engine, this airframe proved itself as one of the most powerful and versatile fighters of the late conflict, rivaling the Mustang in overall performance."
 CAL_cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Vought F4U Corsair"
 CAL_cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "F4U Corsair"
 CAL_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "A design from New England, the F4U Corsair is an aircraft of many roles- though it found its niche within the close air support wings of the Pacific Navy. Capable of heavy munitions loads, the F4U Corsair spent most of its service acting as a shore platform or sea-based striker, eliminating merchant shipping in the later parts of the war."
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Douglas B-23 Dragon"
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "B-23 Dragon"
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "A pre-Civil War design, the B-23 Dragon found itself within the hands of nearly every military in the former United States. With its rugged design and capability to strike targeted areas, it found great success as a tactical bomber as well as conducting early strategic strikes, though that role was quickly phased out."
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "North American B-25 Mitchell"
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "B-25 Mitchell"
 CAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "A replacement for the B-23 Dragon, the North American B-25 Mitchell was the most common- though perhaps not most iconic- strike aircraft of the Pacific Theater, with several hundred produced over the course of the conflict. The design, while perhaps not groundbreaking, was extremely effective, so much so that the AUS adopted a variant under the designation B-28."
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_1: "Republic F-84 Thunderjet"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_1_short: "F-84 Thunderjet"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_1_desc: "The Republic F-84 Thunderjet is what can be called one of the first true 'strike fighters'- capable of both air to air and air to ground combat in fairly equal capacities. Its ingrained wing-based fuel tanks and in-air refueling capabilities give it unparalleled loitering capabilities, able to remain on deployment for far longer than other platforms of its period."
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_2: "Republic F-84F Thunderstreak"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_2_short: "F-84F Thunderstreak"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_2_desc: "An evolution of the F-84 Thunderjet's design, the F-84F Thunderstreak has noteable improvements- namely, the swept wings that give it far better handling and aerodynamics than its predecessor. With technological developments as well, the Thunderstreak is able to conduct more and better strike operations than its similarly-named predecessor."
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_3: "North American F-100D Super Sabre"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_3_short: "F-100D Super Sabre"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_3_desc: "A modified version of the F-100 Super Sabre designed for a close-air support role, the F-100D boasts superior avionics, a longer wing, and purpose-built landing flaps. These allow the airframe to carry more munitions and effectively drop them better than earlier Super Sabres, giving it an edge in the close-air support role."
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_4: "Grumman A-6 Intruder"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_4_short: "A-6 Intruder"
 CAL_jet_strike_equipment_4_desc: "The first 'all-weather attack bomber' in any numbers among air forces internationally, the Grumman A-6 Intruder represents a focus on one role- that of the attacker. With integrated weapons systems and a side-by-side cockpit configuration, the A-6 allows for unprecedented capabilities in conducting land-attack operations, particularly with more high-tech munitions."
 
 #Strategic Bombers#
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress"
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "B-17 Flying Fortress"
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "A venerable icon of the Second American Civil War, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is the most produced and used strategic bomber of all forces, seeing use not only in the United States Pacific Air Force (USPAF) but in Federalist, Union State, and even in Combined Syndicate arsenals to a small number. The B-17 is responsible for significant strikes on major military hubs and cities during the conflict, and its influence can be seen in every future American bomber design."
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "B-29 Superfortress"
 CAL_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Among many, the B-29 Superfortress is seen as the bomber which decisively ended the Second American Civil War, and this reputation is not entirely unfounded. Introduced in the USPAF's arsenal towards the end of the war, it participated in a string of daring strikes deep into Union State territory, being so successful in this role that several crashed prototypes were reverse-engineered into a model that now sees service in the Union State arsenal."
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Convair B-36 Peacemaker"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "B-36 Peacemaker"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The first Pacific strategic bomber design to incorporate the use of jet engines, the B-36 Peacemaker derives its use from its moniker: a bringer of peace through superior firepower. Equipped with a maximum range, top altitude, and payloads that would have been difficult to fathom in the Civil War period of American design, the Peacemaker contributes significantly to the strategic arsenal of the Pacific States."
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Boeing B-47 Stratojet"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "B-47 Stratojet"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Designed as a second-generation jet bomber to replace the B-36 Peacemaker, the B-47 Stratojet encapsulates the unofficial mottos of the heads of the USPAF: 'higher, faster, and farther.' The B-47 includes several advancement in avionics technology, such as a swept wing and aerodynamic fuselage, designed to once more reassert the place of American aircraft designers on the cutting-edge of aviation engineering."
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_3: "Boeing B-52 Stratofortress"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short: "B-52 Stratofortress"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "An iterative improvement on the B-47 Stratojet, made in tandem by Boeing design teams, the B-52 Stratofortress seeks to provide a modern improvement on the strategic jet design. Complete with a far larger bombload and range that allows for strikes anywhere within the Western Hemisphere (indeed, as far away as Central and Eastern Europe), the B-52 is a highly desirable addition to the American strategic arsenal."
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_4: "Convair B-58 Hustler"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_4_short: "B-58 Hustler"
 CAL_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_4_desc: "Created to supplement the existing arsenal with rapidly developed technologies, the Convair B-58 Hustler represents a break from the traditional strategic bomber model by focusing on speed and rapid delivery capabilities rather than payload size and range. The aircraft is rated up to Mach Two, and can carry large bombloads to enemy targets in record time, which has proven increasingly wanted by USPAF officers worried about Union State anti-air capabilities."
 
 #Transports#
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_1: "Douglas C-47 Dakota"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_1_short: "C-47 Dakota"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_1_desc: "A military transport aircraft designed from the civilian Douglas DC-3 airliner, the C-47 Dakota saw service on many fronts of the war as a general-purpose transport aircraft. In Pacific usage, it was primarily used to equip forces fighting in the Rocky Mountains, where supplies were limited at best.";
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_2: "Lockheed C-69 Constellation"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_2_short: "C-69 Constellation"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_2_desc: "A successor to the C-47 Dakota, the C-69 Constellation is a military conversion of the Lockheed passenger aircraft. Among improvements made by the Lockheed Corporation are hydraulically-boosted controls, a triple tail to allow for easier storage in existing hangars, and a de-icing system on the wing and tail. All of these desired civilian features serve to make the Constellation widely enjoyed by the military personnel she carries."
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_3: "Lockheed C-130 Hercules"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_3_short: "C-130 Hercules"
 CAL_transport_plane_equipment_3_desc: "The first cargo aircraft in USPAF service to be designed solely for military use and constructed on a large scale, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules is widely regarded as the workhorse of both the Pacific States and the broader Accord-aligned sphere. Designed to be able to easily load and offload cargo both from runway strips and airdrops, as well as carry significant amounts of weight, the C-130 is much appreciated by units operating in far-off areas."
 
 #Helos#
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_1: "Piasecki H-21 Shawnee"
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_1_short: "H-21 Shawnee"
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_1_desc: "The Piasecki H-21 Shawnee represents a shift towards mobility and rapid deployment among the relatively small air branch of the Pacific States' ground forces, with its VTOL capabilities proving extremely effective at facilitating airborne operations and search-and-rescue, a desired capability given the extreme terrain of the Rocky Mountains."
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_2: "Boeing CH-47 Chinook"
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_2_short: "CH-47 Chinook" 
 CAL_utility_helicopter_equipment_2_desc: "The CH-47 Chinook, with its top speed of 170 knots and extremely large cargo capabilities, allows for increased capabilities of large force multipliers through airlifts and airdrops. This performance is highly sought after by Pacific leadership, as the Rocky Mountains can create bottlenecks of conventional transports which can best be overcome by air-mobile capabilities."

A less sharply swept wing allows the plane to be compact enough, as well as a bubble canopy in place of the integrated one on the 229, allowing for a narrower front. Pilots report it is not as nimble as it's land-based counterpart, but still serves well enough despite the limitations upon it."
