CHI_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Xuantong Type 27 was well-known as a new standard rifle for the restored Qing Empire in the 1930s; it's almost a copy of German Mauser M1924. During the wars in Eastern China and the collapse of the Qing Empire, the National Revolutionary Army captured and produced a lot of Xuantong Type 27 but renamed it as Zhongzheng Type 24 not only to remove the former name's monarchist meaning but also to honor General Chiang Kai-shek, the highest ranked NRA martyr of Northern Expedition."
CHI_infantry_equipment_2: "Type 37"
CHI_infantry_equipment_2_short: "T37"
CHI_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Seeing superior Japanese firepower, the NRA military committee realized the urgency of procuring semi-automatic rifles for its infantry. Instead of reintroducing the complex General Liu Rifle, Guangzhou Government imported surplus M1 Garands from the Pacific States of America and New England and renamed them T37. For logistic reasons, these rifles are only equipped by the elite "Sharp Blade Companies" within infantry regiments. Later, the locally produced T37 will symbolize the Chinese Army in the early Kalterkrieg."
CHI_infantry_equipment_3: "Type 45"
CHI_infantry_equipment_3_short: "T45"
CHI_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "A licensed production version of Armalite AR-10, Type 45, is originally introduced to replace the obsolete T37. Receiving negative first-line feedbacks on its immature craft, the Ordnance Department did not commission the T45 on a large scale, viewing it as merely a transitional weapon. Although reliable, its plastics, titanium, and aluminum components were too expensive to manufacture locally. However, its production attempt provided vital experiences to China's young military industry."
CHI_infantry_equipment_4: "Type 54"
CHI_infantry_equipment_4_short: "T54"
CHI_infantry_equipment_4_desc: "The T54 is China's first attempt to create an assault rifle locally. Developed by the Ordnance Department of the Central Military Commission, T54 was based on Armalite AR-18, combining elements of AR-15 while optimized for local production. Due to its reliability, T54 quickly replaced the obsolete T37s and unreliable T45s. Commissioned en masse by the Republic of China Armed Forces and China's myriad revolutionary allies across Asia, T54 will become the symbol of insurgency and armed uprising in Asia."

CHI_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "This Weltkrieg-era German field gun was exported to China in the 1930s, primarily to the League of Eight Provinces. Sun Chuanfang and Chen Jiongming attempted to duplicate it in arsenals under their control, which was relocated to Chongqing in the early 1940s by the KMT-CZGP United Front. During the war, the few operational pieces were mainly used for anti-battery duties and long-range bombardment, providing vital support and firepower for the hopelessly outgunned NRA. Later, it was mounted on captured Chi-To tanks."
CHI_artillery_equipment_2: "155 mm M59 'Tang Lao Zhuang'"
CHI_artillery_equipment_2_short: "155 mm 'Tang Lao Zhuang'"
CHI_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "In the early 1950s, the Ordnance Department purchased American M59 Cannons from the Pacific States. The state-owned Jianxin Industries Corporation soon initiated a localized production effort. Despite its old design, it can still reliably hurl deadly payloads to 20 kilometers away with relative accuracy, rendering it the perfect replacement for old German field and coastal guns. Loving its power while hating its weight, the RoCA artillerymen nicknamed it 'Tang Lao Zhuang,' a localized counterpart of its American nickname."

CHI_motorized_rocket_equipment_1_desc: "Initially a garage duplicate of Japanese Type 4 20 cm Rocket Mortar, the "Flying Mine Lobber" is a crude copycat rocket launched from a gas barrel. They are equally dangerous to their targets and operators, thus earning the nickname 'goddamn artillery.' Nevertheless, their destructve power is still as indisputable as any modern artillery. After standardization, its will be mounted on Jiefang trucks, creating China's first functioning motorized rocket artillery system."

A cheap, inaccurate but formidable weapon, it can be replicated easily and operated effortlessly by uneducated soldiers. With only 600kg in weight, it fits any platform from donkey carriages to ROCA's standard Beijing-Willys Jeeps. Such simplicity made KF-1 the ideal weapon for rebels and partisans. For decades to come, the wrathful shriek of the Worker Bee will resonate wherever imperialist oppression exists."

DNF_light_tank_equipment_0_desc: "Lightly armoured, reasonably armed and exceedingly mobile and with good communications equipment, the Ganz-Mavag tank won the 1942 tank trials and provided the platform for the light tank part of the Danubian armed forces. Already the advantage of the design was understood that it could sow dissention behind enemy lines, spot troop movements, and provide motorised infantry with a punch directly or by calling in artillery. The 45M boasted a removable canvas frame and reduced weight which allowed it to ford amphibiously without any issues, something that became crucial on the Eastern front."

DNF_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "LT vz. 51"
DNF_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The LT vz. 51 represented a radical development in the light tank category that won the role from the Toldi derivative fielded by Ganz-MAVÁG at the 1950 tank trials. The tank had an oscillating turret, where the gun is fixed to the turret and the entire upper turret changes elevation. The KPÚV vz 43 7.5 cm gun was loaded by an automatic loading system fed by two six-round magazines located in on either side of the automatic loader in the turret's bustle, developed by Kurassier of Austria. This allowed for twelve shots in very quick succession, but when those were expended the driver would be forced to retreat so that the tank could be reloaded"
DNF_light_tank_equipment_2: "LT vz. 53"
DNF_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "LT vz. 53"
DNF_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The LT vz. 53 removed the need for the loader to dismount the vehicle, at the cost of removing one of the magazines. This lightened the load of the vehicle overall and it was then further experimented on with regard to airborne deployments which it proved capable of performing without damage in trials."

DNF_light_tank_sa_upgrade_1952_upgrade_desc: "The LT vz. 54 Samohybné Dělostřelectvo represented an upgunned LT vz. 51 with a 90mm and increased muzzle pressure. The autoloader magazine was refined to allow internal loading without a reduction in the total number of shots."
DNF_wartime_light_tank_speed_upgrade2: "Praga TNHPS (dvojkarb.)"
DNF_wartime_light_tank_speed_upgrade2_desc: "By introducing a second carburettor to their engine the Praga TNHPS was able to maintain an ideal fuel ratio for much more of the time. The complaints of the mechanics assigned to maintain them however would make you wonder if it was worth it. Still, it doesn't impede the tanks in the field."

DNF_light_tank_equipment_3_short: "PBV vz. 12"
DNF_light_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The Pěchotní Bojové Vozidlo was built by the Škoda-Zbrojovka machine works in the early 1960's. Combining the firepower of an LT vz. 54 with the carrying capacity of the Obr.T. vz. 51, they created a truly fearsome battlefield contender that blurred the line between tank and APC so much that a new definition had to be created. Fortunately the Danubian Army had a direct doctrinal niche for such a vehicle." 
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_0: "Střední Tank  vz. 43"
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_0_short: "ST vz. 43"
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_0_desc: "Designed prior to the war, the 'Střední Tank' had been informed by the developments and designs in the German forces and their effectiveness on the Eastern and Western Fronts, as well as with some additional information from war-booty pieces of French and Russian origin. With this information in hand the designers at Skoda-Zbrojovka developed a decent hybrid of the Russian T-34's rugged reliability and sloping armor with the German St.Pz.Kpfw. IV's deadly precision and firepower. This tank design then served, with little modification past an up-gunning in the autumn of 1946, as the primary workhorse of the Danubian forces. Whilst it is still a contender, it is past due a replacement."

DNF_modern_tank_equipment_1_short: "Škoda T 50" 
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The Škoda T 50 was designed as a platform that would be able to combine the firepower of a tank-destroyer with the mobility and armour of a medium tank. The design was built with the expectation of refinement in the future and was provided with a highly modular system including magazine, communications and ranging equipment. It took the best parts of the ST vz. 43 and then added several parts to handle it's newly expanded role." 
DNF_MBT_armour_upgrade_1: "Škoda T 50 Br.(1952)"
DNF_MBT_armour_upgrade_1_desc: "The Škoda T 50 Br.(1952) 'brnění' or armouring upgrade involved adding mesh skirts slightly away from the outside body of the tank on the sides and around the rear of the turret, as well thickening the glacis plate on the front in order to provide better protection against recoilless rifles and shaped charges."
DNF_MBT_armour_upgrade_2: "Škoda T 50 Br.(1956)"
DNF_MBT_armour_upgrade_2_desc: "Škoda T 50 Br.(1956) 'brnění' modernised the vehicle armour by introducing a layered armour system that has a central layer of glass-reinforced plastic and ceramic plates which allows for improved protection against HEAT charges without degrading protective performance against kinetic energy penetrators."
DNF_MBT_chassis_upgrade_1: "Škoda T 50C"
DNF_MBT_chassis_upgrade_1_desc: "Škoda T 50 model C carried an improved engine that provided the tank with more horsepower, allowing it to traverse at increased speeds."
DNF_MBT_chassis_upgrade_2: "Škoda T 50F"
DNF_MBT_chassis_upgrade_2_desc: "Škoda T 50 model F was the final refinement of the T 50 chassis that mirrored weight reduction developments through the use of additional layers of ceramic based armour in place of solid cast steel glacis plates."
DNF_MBT_gun_upgrade_1: "100 mm R11"
DNF_MBT_gun_upgrade_1_desc: "The 100 mm R11 was a smoothbore 100mm tank barrel that represented a new generation of firepower for the T 50, moving it from the original KPÚV vz. 43 7.5 cm that been in use for almost a generation by that point. The 100mm HEAT round was found to require fin-stabilisation in order to retain it's penetrative properties, thus the switch to a smoothbore gun."
DNF_MBT_gun_upgrade_2: "100 mm AK1"
DNF_MBT_gun_upgrade_2_desc: "The 100 mm AK1 refers to the implementation of the Austrian Karabineer autoloader of the vz. 51 upcalibred to match the Skoda smoothbore R11, providing the Danubian armour with much more punch in a short time." 
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_2: "Škoda T 59"
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_2_short: "Škoda T 59"
DNF_modern_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The Škoda T 59 represented a radical design change, based on the concept that nuclear weapons might end any war a tank is involved in quickly. Additionally it captured developments in French design emphasising mobility and then firepower with armor coming in third under the guidance of design veteran Ferdinand Porsche, concluded in the T 59 (codename Leopard). Porsche's firm however was considered too small to build the required number and so Škoda won the construction tender, but with Porsche's design and a split of the proceeds. Regardless, a T 59 poses a significant threat to any party it may encounter on the battlefield."

NFA_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The Char 25T was designed around the gun and mobility so therefore little to no importance was put on the armor. The 90 mm gun shared the same ammunition as the gun used in the anadian A48 Brock, allowing for interoperability in logistics. The tank was supposed to get up to 65km/h on the road with a 40km/h cruising speed. The gun was fed by an automatic loader. The total amount of ammunition that was stored inside the tank totaled to 52 shells, 16 of which were found in the turret." 
NFA_MBT_armour_upgrade_1: "Char 30T (1951)"
NFA_MBT_armour_upgrade_1_desc: "The Char 30T(1951) armouring upgrade involved adding mesh skirts slightly away from the outside body of the tank on the sides and around the rear of the turret, as well thickening the glacis plate on the front in order to provide better protection against recoilless rifles and shaped charges. This somewhat significantly impacted the performance of the tank, bringing it's top speed down from 65km/h to 55km/h."

The gun itself is also frequently found in caches in the countryside, used by Francstireurs and Partisans and generally seen as an emblem of the Syndicalist era in the metropole and of revolutionary sentiment. The quantities with which it was made is such that it even displaced the Arsenal Alger's inventory to take top position."
