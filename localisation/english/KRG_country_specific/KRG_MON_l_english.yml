# nat ideas
MON_nomadic_folk: "A Nomadic People"
MON_nomadic_folk_desc: "The vast flocks and herds that roam the steppe mean that there are certain requirements that prevent men from being called to war... and frankly make it easier for them to not be found when the call comes."
MON_spirit_of_genghis: "Descendents of the Great Khan"
MON_spirit_of_genghis_desc: "The Ma may call themselves the Horse Clique, but none sneer when the Mongol comes to prove his worth in the field. On horseback, accept no substitute!"
MON_russian_yoke: "Under the Russian Yoke"
MON_russian_yoke_desc: "The Russians like to claim the Tatars had them under their yoke, but the reverse is true of modern history. Brief flashes of independence from China and Russia have always ended with one or the other returning. Now the nation is shackled to Russia once more, a vassal and buffer against China in their far east."
MON_chinese_yoke: "Once More Under China"
MON_chinese_yoke_desc: "The Republic's aspirations have failed and the insurgent raiders supported by China have brought the fledgling independent government low. Once again, Mongolia is under Chinese rule, and the Lamas continue their rule in their monasteries as though nothing had changed in four hundred years."

## events
krg_mon.0.t: "A Wind Rises on the Steppe"
krg_mon.0.d: "With events unfolding in Russia, there is a renewed sense among the people of Mongolia that their independence will need new safeguards.\n\nIn the gers and monasteries across the plains, the people talk about the future, and what is to be done. In Urga, there is even muttering in the court of the occupier general, Berzarin.\n\nNothing is yet certain however, and with the future an open book as yet unwritten, the moment comes where a choice is made. Either the Mongol Ardyn Nam - the Mongolian People's Party, will confront General Nikolai Berzarin and dethrone him, or he will cut a deal with someone to cling onto office, even if it becomes a meaningless title."
krg_mon.0.a: "The MAN sweep to power!"
krg_mon.0.b: "Shady deals are done."

krg_mon.1.t: "The Mongol Ardyn Nam Seize Power!"
krg_mon.1.d: "Lead by Anandyn Amar, the Mongol Ardyn Nam gathered a large group and marched on the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Mongolia, a fortified compound just outside of Urga. Upon their arrival they requested to speak with General Nikolai Berzarin, and presented him with the terms that they would either besiege the compound and imprison him, or he could peacefully step aside and allow Mongolia independence once more.\n\nGiven his unenviable position, Berzarin ceded power, stating he had never sought it anyway.\n\nAs jubilant celebrations broke out in Urga, riders were dispatched across the plains to spread the news."
krg_mon.1.a: "Mongolia is Free!"

krg_mon.2.t: "The Question of the Lamas"
krg_mon.2.d: "The 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu§! (the Bogd Khan) is held and venerated by many in Mongolia, and the Buddhist religious orders and the aristocracy still hold vast power over the lives of the individual people. The question has been raised therefore if a constitutional theocracy with the Bogd Khan at it's head would be a more appropriate form of government for Mongolia than this western style presidential democracy we are founding.\n\nUltimately the decision will be for the current government if they will step aside for the historical tradition of Mongolia, or if they will hold fast and build something new."
krg_mon.2.a: "The people will it, we will cede."
krg_mon.2.b: "Their place is not in office."

krg_mon.3.t: "General Berzarin Offers His Services"
krg_mon.3.d: "Having been recently deposed and facing the potential of a deportation to war-torn Russia, General Nikolai Berzarin has offered to remain in Mongolia and serve the new government, at least for the time being. His talents are well known and he has been a pragmatic and fair ruler until now - there would be no threat of him turning against the current government as he can see when he is outnumbered.\n\nOf course, some in the government still have scores to settle with Berzarin for actions during his administration."
krg_mon.3.a: "He can serve in the army."
krg_mon.3.b: "He can serve... a jail term!"

krg_mon.4.t: "Ja Lama killed in Shootout!"
krg_mon.4.d: "The aged adventurer and pan-Mongolist, formerly part of the government under General Berzarin was killed today in a shootout after attempting to incite an armed revolt against the Republic of Mongolia. Part of this incitement was the robbery of a cache of rifles, which was interdicted by soldiers of the Mongolian Republican Army.\n\nThe ensuing firefight claimed several lives from Ja Lama's party including his own, as well as four soldiers. Perhaps though, given the man's personal history as a trouble maker, we should be thankful he has gone on to meet White Tara..."
krg_mon.4.a: "Hmm. Well."

krg_mon.5.t: "Business As Usual?"
krg_mon.5.d: "The muttering has gotten too much for General Berzarin. He knows that the Mongolians all doubt his ability to lead the country, but he knows as well that he needs to make a deal before someone presents him with an ultimatum he can't refuse.\n\nThere are two candidates. He could reach out to the revered 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu§! (the Bogd Khan) and have him legitimise his government, as Von Sternberg did with the previous holder of the title. Or he could promote those amongst his advisors who are believers in Gorgulov's grand Scythian idea, and as Mongolians were able to identify with this narrative of wild, reckless horsemen.\n\nThey were radicals, but they would be radicals he could count on Russian support for..."
krg_mon.5.a: "Go to the Lamas."
krg_mon.5.b: "Promote the Scythians."

krg_mon.6.t: "The Flag Debate"
krg_mon.6.d: "The formal fact of independence is made a joke when they still fly a variant of the Russian Tricolour above government buildings.\n\nThere are two options. A more traditionalist flag for a proper Mongolian State, or one that speaks to some vaguely Republican ideal, even if there are no actual republicans to be found in the government of Berzarin's Mongolia."
krg_mon.6.a: "A traditionalist flag works"
krg_mon.6.b: "Let us wear the clothes of democracy."

krg_mon.7.t: "Chaos in Urga!"
krg_mon.7.d: "A shootout took place in Urga today between members of the Revolutionary Army in Mongolia and several partisans of the Mongol Ardyn Nam. Their exclusion from power-broking talks has left their leadership frustrated and bitter as the country apparently seems set to move to a more fearful and radical regime modelled on Gorgulov's Scythian ideal.\n\nHopefully this will not be the start of anything larger. While several were killed in the fire fight, more have been arrested. The leadership of the MAN are absent their usual haunts, and may have fled the country to Inner Mongolia in China or Buryatia for the time being. It is hard to tell."
krg_mon.7.a: "Oh dear."

krg_mon.10.t: "Dealing with Mongolia"
krg_mon.10.d: "It seems no matter where you look, Republics rear their heads. We do not recognise the Republic of Mongolia's independence, they are the rightful subjects of China. But another war, even against such a pitiful enemy, so soon would be unpopular and could be destabilising.\n\nInstead we will use the Qinghai Mongols against their brethren, and send a cavalry division through the mountain passes. If they can cause enough chaos, the Republic will be discredited by it's own people and we will be able to push the Lamas to work as our stooges."
krg_mon.10.a: "Excellent, send in the cavalry."

krg_mon.11.t: "An Insurgency in the West"
krg_mon.11.d: "Those Chinese devils in Beiyang have sent their lackeys, the Qinghai Mongol cavalry division, into the west of the country. Coming through the mountain passes, they are causing chaos and unrest.\n\nThe cavalry will need to be extirpated from our lands, whittled down to nothing and destroyed or the people will clamour against us and install the Lamas, who will no doubt bow to the Beiyang's demands and let them take our independence from us."
krg_mon.11.a: "We will fight these bandits!"

krg_mon.12.t: "Beiyang sends reinforcements"
krg_mon.12.d: "Those Chinese devils in Beiyang have sent more of their lackeys, the Qinghai Mongol cavalry division, into the west of the country. [MON_Passes_Blocked]"
krg_mon.12.a: "We must redouble our efforts."

krg_mon.13.t: "The Result of the Punitive Expedition"
krg_mon.13.d: "The troops of the Mongolian Republican Army today returned from a police action in the West of the country and reported that they had killed a number of the bandits and raiders sent by the Beiyang chinese!"
krg_mon.13.a: "Excellent."

krg_mon.14.t: "Closing the Passes"
krg_mon.14.d: "Sending a contingent of the Mongolian Republican Army to hold and secure the passes will stem the tide of guns and horsemen moving into the country through the Western Border, reducing the ability of the Beiyang Chinese to support their bandit insurgency and allowing us to remove those raiders who still remain in the country in confidence."
krg_mon.14.a: "The passes will hold"

krg_mon.15.t: "The Government Falls"
krg_mon.15.d: "The ongoing insurgency has seen too many homes destroyed and families damaged. The flocks in the west of the country are depleted. The people cannot support this burden of an ineffective government any longer.\n\nThe MAN leadership today were forced to surrender government to the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu§! (the Bogd Khan), who reached out to Beiyang and struck a deal for them to withdraw their bandits."
krg_mon.15.a: "And under China we fall again..."

krg_mon.16.t: "The Insurgency Fails"
krg_mon.16.d: "The Chinese bandits were unable to maintain their reign of terror and ultimately they were rounded up in a systematic action by the soldiers of the Mongolian Republican Army.\n\nThe people now acknowledge the supremacy of the Republican government wholeheartedly, as it has proven it can protect them from the depredations of foreigners who seek to rule over them.\n\nOf course, the Beiyang may not take this lying down. We should be wary."
krg_mon.16.a: "Mongolia stands proud."

krg_mon.17.t: "The Insurgency Fails"
krg_mon.17.d: "The Qinghai Mongols have been routed and driven out of Mongolia by the Republican Army there. We have a small window of opportunity where we can perhaps manufacture enough dissatisfaction to have our armies march north.\n\nBut we will have to act quickly before the public mood shifts again."
krg_mon.17.a: "Noted."
krg_mon.17.b: "A touch busy for this."

krg_mon.18.t: "The Window Closes"
krg_mon.18.d: "Since we haven't moved in the last three months, the mood for any war to reclaim Mongolia appears not to be the case.\n\nAs such, we will have to form a new justification to attack, if we so wish."
krg_mon.18.a: "Noted."

krg_mon.19.t: "The Bogd Khanate"
krg_mon.19.d: "Given the current unrest in Russia it appears that the Lamas have once again taken charge of the Mongolian Steppe, though this time without a Russian madman at the helm. We have an opportunity here. By promising the aristocracy and the Lamas that we will respect their ancient rights, we can add Mongolia back into the fold once more, proving we are the one true China."
krg_mon.19.a: "Send an Envoy..."

krg_mon.20.t: "A Chinese Envoy"
krg_mon.20.d: "An envoy from the Chinese capital of Beiyang has come to offer us protection under the umbrella of mighty China once again, since Russia has fallen into chaos.\n\nThe envoy offers to respect the ancient rights of the aristocracy and the Lamas, and that the administration of the Bogd Khanate will remain much the same, if only under Chinese protection as it was for centuries.\n\nMany are in favour of this concept, though some still hate the Chinese merchants and do not trust the words of an envoy from Beiyang."
krg_mon.20.a: "We will accede, if our rights are respected."
krg_mon.20.b: "Promises can be broken. No."

krg_mon.21.t: "Mongolia is bowed"
krg_mon.21.d: "Our envoy was successful in convincing the Lamas to accede to vassalage under our rule, as it once was for China and Mongolia, it is now again.\n\nTruly we are the one legitimate China, for even the Outer Mongolians acknowledge our superior strength!"
krg_mon.21.a: "Excellent."

krg_mon.22.t: "Mongolia is unbowed"
krg_mon.22.d: "Our envoy was unsuccessful in convincing the Lamas to accede to vassalage under our rule. However, we are the one legitimate China, even if the Outer Mongolians do not acknowledge our superior strength!"
krg_mon.22.a: "They will learn the hard way."

krg_mon.23.t: "The Question of Mongolia"
krg_mon.23.d: "Having success fallen at our feet in the confrontation with Beiyang, we can turn our eyes to the northern border and deal with the Mongolian state. The country has broken free of Russia due to their own civil war, and it would be an opportune time to remind Mongolia of how it can prosper under the august protection of China.\n\nNo people should contend with existing merely as a buffer state, and the people's of Inner and Outer Mongolia deserve their future protected and real autonomy, within China proper."
krg_mon.23.a: "Send an Envoy"

krg_mon.24.t: "A Chinese Envoy"
krg_mon.24.d: "An envoy from the Chinese Guangzhou government has come to offer us protection under the umbrella of mighty China once again, since Russia has fallen into chaos.\n\nThe envoy offers to respect the ancient rights of the people of Mongolia and promises autonomy in our affairs as well as the long fought for unificiation of Inner and Outer Mongolia within China's proteetion as it was for centuries.\n\nMany are in favour of this concept, though some still hate the Chinese merchants and do not trust the words of an envoy from Guangzhou."
krg_mon.24.a: "We will accede, if our rights are respected."
krg_mon.24.b: "Promises can be broken. No."

krg_mon.25.t: "Mongolia will join us!"
krg_mon.25.d: "The leaders of Outer Mongolia saw the wisdom in the words of our emissary and have acceeded to submit to Chinese overlordship, as long as their rights and autonomy are preserved."
krg_mon.25.a: "Of course they will be."

krg_mon.26.t: "Mongolia spurns our offer!"
krg_mon.26.d: "The leaders of Outer Mongolia refused to see the wisdom in the words of our emissary and have declined to submit to Chinese overlordship, stating that promises of rights and autonomy can be broken, but that their independence will have it preserved."
krg_mon.26.a: "A shame. To arms then."

krg_mon.30.t: "Demanding Berzarin's Surrender"
krg_mon.30.d: "Despite the withdrawal of Russian support for his regime due to the civil war that has overtaken their country, Berzarin has managed to cut a deal with local elements in Outer Mongolia to maintain his rule of the country.\nGiven the issues we have had historically with Russians in Mongolia§! (the less said of Von Ungern-Sternberg the better!), it is obvious we should act now, to retrieve Outer Mongolia and remove the threat of rogue Mongol raiders on our Northern border, while Russia is distracted."
krg_mon.30.a: "Send an Ultimatum."

krg_mon.31.t: "Demanding Berzarin's Surrender"
krg_mon.31.d: "Despite the withdrawal of Russian support for his regime due to the civil war that has overtaken their country, Berzarin has managed to cut a deal with local elements in Outer Mongolia to maintain his rule of the country.\nGiven the issues we have had historically with Russians in Mongolia§! (the less said of Von Ungern-Sternberg the better!), it is obvious we should act now, to retrieve Outer Mongolia and remove the threat of rogue Mongol raiders on our Northern border, while Russia is distracted."
krg_mon.31.a: "Send an Ultimatum."

krg_mon.32.t: "A Chinese Ultimatum"
krg_mon.32.d: "It was going to happen sooner or later - the Chinese have realised that Russia is in no position to protect our regime since the civil war has weakened the country and distracted the leadership.\nNow they have sent an ultimatum to us, seeking our surrender to their government and ending the current regime in Mongolia. We can still request help from Russia and perhaps they can rescue us, though the price might be the fragile independence we have carved. It would be preferable to the Chinese for many Mongolians."
krg_mon.32.a: "Request help from Vatutin in Siberia..."
krg_mon.32.b: "Request help from Vatutin in Moscow..."
krg_mon.32.c: "Request help from Gorgulov..."

krg_mon.33.t: "A Request for Help from Mongolia"
krg_mon.33.d: "The Chinese are threatening Mongolia, demanding General Berzarin there surrender to them and hand over the country.\nUnfortunately the pressure of the civil war means we can't really stop them right now, but we could send troops and supplies, just supplies, or tell them we have nothing to give them."
krg_mon.33.a: "Send men and guns!"
krg_mon.33.b: "We can spare some guns only"
krg_mon.33.c: "We're fighting for our lives here!"

krg_mon.34.t: "A Request for Help from Mongolia"
krg_mon.34.d: "The Chinese are threatening Mongolia, demanding General Berzarin there surrender to them and hand over the country.\nWhile the country is still recovering from the civil war it is entirely possible that we could keep Mongolia out of Chinese hands if we took them in as a formal protectorate."
krg_mon.34.a: "We will defend our Mongolian protectorate."
krg_mon.34.b: "We can't get into a war with the Chinese now!"

krg_mon.35.t: "A Request for Help from Mongolia"
krg_mon.35.d: "The Chinese are threatening Mongolia, demanding General Berzarin there surrender to them and hand over the country.\nWhile the country is still recovering from the civil war it is entirely possible that we could keep Mongolia out of Chinese hands if we took them in as a formal protectorate. The Scythians and Mongolians are, if not one and the same, certainly brother peoples. Our decision here is simple, and necessitated by Vozhd Gorgulov's own beliefs. Mongolia, for the Mongolians, under our shadow."
krg_mon.35.a: "Berzarin must go, but we will protect our brothers."

krg_mon.36.t: "Vatutin sends Guns and Men!"
krg_mon.36.d: "General Vatutin has deep reserves of generosity. While it is not a formal guarantee of protection, and we will have to fight the Chinese, we at least will be well supplied and with our brothers at our sides."
krg_mon.36.a: "It was the best we could hope for."

krg_mon.37.t: "Vatutin sends Guns!"
krg_mon.37.d: "General Vatutin has deep reserves of generosity. While it is not a formal guarantee of protection, and we will have to fight the Chinese, we at least will be well supplied."
krg_mon.37.a: "It was the best we could hope for."

krg_mon.38.t: "Vatutin sends... nothing!"
krg_mon.38.d: "General Vatutin has deep reserves, but not of generosity.\nHe has left us out to hang on the wind, with no guns, volunteers or even an offer of supporting our independence.\nWe are betrayed by the KORA and the Russians. We must never forget this day of ignominy."
krg_mon.38.a: "There is no point in bloodshed."
krg_mon.38.b: "We do not need them. No surrender!"

krg_mon.39.t: "Vatutin offers a protectorate!"
krg_mon.39.d: "General Vatutin has sent men and guns.\nUnfortunately they have been sent with a document detailing our surrender to Russia as a protectorate state under their guidance. He believes this is the only resolution to the conflict with China."
krg_mon.39.a: "Better this than the Chinese."

krg_mon.40.t: "Russia reclaims Mongolia!"
krg_mon.40.d: "The Russian State has sent a new contingent of troops, guns and vehicles to Mongolia, as well as forced the regime to sign a document detailing their protectorate status under Russia.\nWe have sent the child running to it's mother's skirts. We will have to be more clever in future."
krg_mon.40.a: "Drat."
krg_mon.40.b: "Time to start a land war in Asia."

krg_mon.41.t: "Gorgulov offers a protectorate!"
krg_mon.41.d: "Vozhd Gorgulov has sent men and guns.\nUnfortunately they have been sent with a document detailing our surrender to Russia as a protectorate state under their guidance. He believes this is the only resolution to the conflict with China. General Berzarin is to report to Moscow for debriefing, and Jambyn Lhkümbe will be the new Head of State."
krg_mon.41.a: "Better this than the Chinese."

krg_mon.42.t: "Mongolia surrenders to the Ultimatum!"
krg_mon.42.d: "The criminal Berzarin regime surrendered their troops, guns and vehicles to a detachment of Chinese soldiers today, signing a surrender document and allowing Mongolia to pass into the hands of China, where it rightfully belongs."
krg_mon.42.a: "A peaceful resolution."

krg_mon.43.t: "Mongolia ignores the Ultimatum!"
krg_mon.43.d: "As the time ran out for the Mongolian reply, there was no news.\nToday we prepare to cross the border into Mongolia and deal with these insolent steppe-nomads and their Russian paymasters."
krg_mon.43.a: "They have chosen poorly."
krg_mon.43.b: "We should deal with the Civil War anyway."

## tts
