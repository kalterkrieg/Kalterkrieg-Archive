(Civil and Military Organization)\n§LThe Civil and Military Organization is a right-wing and right-wing underground movement of South French army officers, business personnel, academics, architects, lawyers, and bourgeoisie. While it is independent in it's activities it is also partly an extension of the South French Parti Social Français (PSF) of François de La Rocque in terms of it's goals and positions.

  FRA_social_conservative_party: "Conseil d'État-A/C"
  FRA_social_conservative_party_long: "§LConseil d'État - Agraires/Catholiques§! (Council of State - Agrarians/Catholics)\n§LThe 'moderate' conservatives of the Counseil d'État are split into two main factions. The first, the Agrarians, are landowners, corporatists and peasants who stand for traditional, culturally conservative politics, wishing to return France to a time before the Commune's debauchery, priding themselves on the defence of family values and the promotion of subsidies for agronomists and peasants. They are aligned with the Catholic Right on many (but not all) issues. These intellectual conservatives and religious leaders, long oppressed by the Syndicalists, have largely become supportive of a Monarchist restoration. While the Agrarians were prominent in the Commune through the Peasant Front and other organisations, the Catholics' political leaders are largely former Exiles from Algeria, who have crossed to Paris following Mordacq's capitulation to the secularist Radicals.§!"

(Council of State - Technocrats)\n§LA group of right-wing technocrats, this assembly of men consist of bankers, industrialists, and businessmen who wish to see France transformed into a well run economic machine that is only eclipsed by Germany. Some of these men are said to subscribe to the economic beliefs of Saint-Simonianism, a belief in industrialisation as the motor of progress in society. Chiefly, they are deeply critical of partisanship and as a result are pulling Bock towards instituting an apolitical system in the vein of the German DNEF.§!"

(Council of State - Petainists/Left)\n§LThe Petainists and Belin's former Neosocialist Left share a singular common goal of promoting paternal autocratic politics for the French state. The Petainists, named after Marshal Philippe Pétain, advocate for an authoritarian government with strong centralized power and traditional values. Belin's Neosocialist Left, on the other hand, promotes a paternalistic welfare state that combines elements of socialism and liberalism. Despite their different backgrounds and political views, these two groups found common ground in their desire to maintain a strong and stable French state under a centralized government.§!"

While Bock still has his life, thousands of young men under his command during the war can no longer say the same.\n\nBorn in the province of Brandenburg, Bock is just as Prussian as the Kaiser. A monarchist, militarist, and decorated veteran of the First Weltkrieg, it's no surprise that Wilhelm III handpicked the Marshal to be the one to capture Paris in 1945. However, the great honor of capturing the heart of Syndicalism turned into Bock's curse, as two years later he still leads the Militärverwaltung von Nordfrankreich. Bock's army of soldiers and officers are now replaced with an army of bureaucrats and garrison troops. It's lucky the Marshal is able to speak fluent French, since it seems everyday more and more of his loyal men are replaced with collaborators itching for a spot in whatever state succeeds the occupational government.\n\nFedor Von Bock spends his days in his office and Parisian cafes, counting the days until the military occupation of Northern France ends and he may return to Germany and receive his hero's welcome. But until that day, the aging Field Marshal must sign paper after paper, one after the other, to rebuild this Godforsaken country he is forced to call home."

  fra_occupation.1.d.a: "The efforts of the Troisième Bureau have managed to root out another nest of Syndicalist sympathisers.\n\nWe suspect there may still be others, but their influence is diminished and the state moves towards security and order once more."
  fra_occupation.1.d.b: "The efforts of the Troisième Bureau have managed to root out what they believe to be the last major nest of Syndicalist sympathisers.\n\nWe suspect there may still be others, but their influence is shattered at this point and can be handled by conventional police work.\n\nWe have achieved security and order."
  fra_occupation.1.a: "Good work."

  fra_occupation.2.t: "Military Factory Conversion Complete"
  fra_occupation.2.d: "With help from the German industrial combines, we've successfully reorganized the former military factories to the production of civilian goods in service of the French people and the French state."
  fra_occupation.2.a: "Excellent."

  fra_occupation.3.t: "Henri d'Orleans Arrives in Paris"
  fra_occupation.3.d: "Arriving from Italy by aeroplane, the return of his Grace, Henri d'Orléans to France seems to mark the end of an era for the German occupation and the potential beginning of something new.\n\nIf he secures the support of the Kaiser and the German Empire, the House of Orléans would provide the perfect fit for a future Kingdom, and an end to this period of occupation and direct German rule that has begun to chafe event the most Allemagnophilic segments of the populace."
  fra_occupation.3.a: "Welcome home, Henri!"

  fra_occupation.4.t: "The Media Coup"
  fra_occupation.4.d: "Speculation regarding a so-called \"Media Coup\" has been going around the nation ever since the arrival of Henri and other members of the House of Orléans. The rumors state that members of the former royal house have supposedly kidnapped journalists to write articles that favoured them. While these rumors have been mostly been dismissed as ludicrous fictions created by fevered minds, a subjective analysis of the press of late shows there has been a positive shift in the attitude in media regarding a royal restoration in France."
  fra_occupation.4.a: "Let us arrange a meeting."

  fra_occupation.5.t: "A Meeting in Paris"
  fra_occupation.5.d: "With the recent arrival of Henri d'Orléans, it was no surprise that those currently in charge of the state, the German Administration under Feldmarschall Fedor von Bock were perhaps the first to take notice. However, their position on the return of Henri to France, whether they supported or opposed it was unknown, until recently.\n\nAfter a meeting held at the Hotel Métropole in Paris, with Militärbefehlshaber von Bock and his Grace, Henri d'Orléans in attendance, the Ministerium für Frankreich - the German Occupation Administration - have now openly stated their support for Henri d'Orléans to become King of France in the near future."
  fra_occupation.5.a: "Most impressive."

  fra_occupation.6.t: "Affairs of the Council of State"
  fra_occupation.6.d: "The Conseil d'État - the Council of State - recently permitted the entrance of a guest to one of their regularly scheduled meetings. This is highly unusual for the organisation, whose direct transparency mostly exists in the form of minutes released to the public journal of note, and of direct objectives released to the various state and government organisations that are answerable to their administration.\n\nGiven that the guest was his Grace, Henri d'Orléans, those who seek horoscopes in political doings are now all atwitter about the forthcoming royal restoration, stating that it must be a done deal."
  fra_occupation.6.a: "What will he do next?"

  fra_occupation.7.t: "New Monthly Journal Launched"
  fra_occupation.7.d: "With the recent meetings between many French journalists (such as remain) and his Grace, Henri d'Orléans being held in Paris at the Hotel Métropole, not many knew what this meetings was full regarding. It has now come to light, in the first issue of his new magazine - Le Revue Royal - that this meeting was to establish the magazine itself. For this magazine, the Duke sought out only the best journalists available, and was able to convince them to work for him."
  fra_occupation.7.a: "Such a grand idea!"

  fra_occupation.8.t: "His Grace, Henri d'Orléans On the Radio"
  fra_occupation.8.d: "For the first time for many people, they were able to hear the future King of France, their future King, speak.\n\nWhile previously having read his words in the Le Revue Royal, there was a popular swell of support upon hearing his voice, exhorting them to recall the greatness that France once had, and will have again once the Monarchy is restored in the nation once the shameful divergence to Syndicalism is forgotten. Many were moved by the words of Henri d'Orléans and felt as if he was sitting with them, by the radio, in the many homes of France."
  fra_occupation.8.a: "Incroyable."

  fra_occupation.9.t: "The End of the Militärbefehlshaber"
  fra_occupation.9.d: "Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich, Feldmarschall Fedor Von Bock today tendered his resignation of the role to the Ministerium für Frankreich, with the recommendation of the abolition of the German military occupation in France to follow immediately.\n\nMany German civil servants are already packing their bags and preparing to return to their homeland upon this news, as the Conseil d'État has formed a Conseil d'regence - a Regency Council - in anticipation of a royal restoration. For the time being they will administer the state, until everything is finalised."
  fra_occupation.9.a: "The rest is in Henri's hands."

  fra_occupation.10.t: "The Parisian Government Charter"
  fra_occupation.10.d: "The Charte du gouvernement parisien - Parisian Government Charter - is a document that has been created by the Conseil d'État over the last three years, planning the constitutional shape of the nation once the German military occupation came to an end.\n\nWith some slight modifications to reflect the recent fever and plans toward royal restoration, the document is now ready to be signed and formally placed written into the constitutional foundation of the nation."
  fra_occupation.10.a: "A new beginning for France."

  fra_occupation.11.t: "Coronation of Henri VI"
  fra_occupation.11.d: "For the first time since 1848, a member of the House of Orléans now sits upon the throne of France. Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie d'Orléans, Count of Paris and great-great-grandson of Louis Phillippe I, has been crowned Henri VI; the German Military Administration of North France giving way to a new Kingdom of France. A grand coronation ceremony was held in Reims Cathedral where the Archbishop of Paris placed the Crown of Louis XV upon Henri VI's head; undoubtedly a special moment for the devoutly Catholic king. While the event was celebrated widely throughout the restored kingdom, the reaction from the French Republic was less than pleasant. The government in Marseille was quick to issue a statement condemning the coronation and referred to Henri VI as the \"false king of a German puppet state\". However, none in the new Kingdom of France were really paying attention at that point in time." 
  fra_occupation.11.a: "La Nation, la Loi, le Roi!"."

  fra_occupation.12.t: "Les Allemands sont partis!"
  fra_occupation.12.d: "The last of the German administrators have packed their bags, took their families and departed Paris. Whilst the state is still indebted to our allies in Allemagne, it is a glorious day for France, that we once again have our own hand on the tiller, and the Germans are gone home." 
  fra_occupation.12.a: "Vive La Roi!"

  fra_occupation.13.t: "La Maladie"
  fra_occupation.13.d: "It is an open secret, and one that cannot be avoided or ignored much longer. The population especially among the lower, working classes, turns to drink in excess to soothe the pain of their lost utopia. While the socialists fed them a great deal of nonsense, they did make measurable improvements in living standards for those who were poorest amongst us prior to the First Weltkrieg.\n\nTheir revolution has been crushed by German Armour and Colonial Marines, and while they do not seek to dismember or overthrow the government, many ache for what they perceive as a loss. They do not understand, but they know they are hurt, so they numb themselves with the bottle. This is not going to be something we can fix quickly." 
  fra_occupation.13.a: "La guerre, la douleur, le regret..."

  fra_occupation.14.t: "The End of the Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich"
  fra_occupation.14.d: "Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich, Feldmarschall Fedor Von Bock has tendered his resignation of the role to the Ministerium für Frankreich, with the recommendation of the abolition of the German military occupation in France to follow immediately. The garrison troops of the Auslands-Festungkommando Frankreich have boarded trains and returned to Germany for reassignment or demobilisation.\n\nIn replacement of our occupation regime is a Monarchist French one under the leadership of a regency council prior to the coronation of Henri d'Orleans."
  fra_occupation.14.a: "The rest is in Henri's hands."

  fra_occupation.100.t: "New Parties Form"
  fra_occupation.100.d: "Following the decree by the King to allow parties to partake in the election process, new parties has predictably began to form. Out of these, the electoral commission has found four major parties that is certain to become electable.\n\nWhat the future now holds is a question of uncertainity, however the King's wish will be upheld!" #TODO North France: make a better description, this is a word ramble.
  fra_occupation.100.a: "Ah, Democracy!"
  fra_occupation.100.tooltip: "The §YElectoral Commission§! believes $FRA_partisan_soccon_party$, $FRA_partisan_authdem_party$, $FRA_partisan_pataut_party$ as well as $FRA_partisan_natpop_party$ are suitable candidates for an upcoming election."

  fra_occupation.102.t: "The National Front"
  fra_occupation.102.d: "Following the template of \"Le Systeme Bredowiste\", the relevant factions of the functional administration of the state have formed a unified \"National Front\" organisation that provides a big-tent for their interests to cooperate within the confines of one internal party.\n\nThis solution is inestimably superior to the endless squabbling of \"democratic parties\" who ultimately all represent the same set of interests with slightly different perspectives, and provides a streamlined means for the King to quickly understand, consume information and decide the path the state will proceed upon."
  fra_occupation.102.a: "Viva La Roi!"

  fra_occupation.103.t: "The National List"
  fra_occupation.103.d: "The National List has to have some preference from the various groups represented within the body of the National Front - there is a subtle balance of power that only the King can have a final say upon.\n\nIf he demures then there will be chaos, thus a decision must be made."
  fra_occupation.103.a: "Planistes"

  fra_occupation.103.b2: "Catholique"

  fra_occupation.104.t: "La formation démocratique"
  fra_occupation.104.d: "Averting a slavish following of German political trends, the King has stated he will take a constitutional role and allow for the French people to determine their own fates according to the popular ballot.\n\nThis solution is inestimably superior to the cliqueish insiderist manipulation of \"National Front\" organisations who ultimately all represent the same set of interests with slightly different perspectives, whilst a democratic formation will provide a broad reference that means the King ultimately will have a full recognisance of the will of his subjects before deciding the path the state will proceed upon."
  fra_occupation.104.a: "Viva La Roi!"

  fra_occupation.105.t: "Bloody May"
  fra_occupation.105.d: "As May Day celebrations took place in Paris, tensions were high between the French population and the German occupation forces. Despite a ban on public gatherings, protests and demonstrations occurred across the city. German authorities responded with force, using tear gas and firing shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Several people were arrested and some were injured in the clashes as workers chanted \"Travailleurs la lutte continue!\" - a reference to the percieved ongoing struggle of those deluded Communards who cannot believe they have lost.\n\nThe CGT and the OLT were among the organizers of the protests, with their members leading many of the small and scattered demonstrations.\n\nThe German occupation government was angered by the displays of defiance, and promised harsher measures to suppress any future resistance."
  fra_occupation.105.a: "Bloody syndicalists!"

  fra_news.1.t: "Coronation of Henri VI"
  fra_news.1.desc: "For the first time since 1848, a member of the House of Orléans now sits upon the throne of France. Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie d'Orléans, Count of Paris and great-great-grandson of Louis Phillippe I, has been crowned Henri VI; the German Military Administration of North France giving way to a new Kingdom of France. A grand coronation ceremony was held in Reims Cathedral where the Archdiocese of Paris placed the Crown of Louis XV upon Henri VI's head; undoubtedly a special moment for the devoutly Catholic king. While the event was celebrated widely throughout the restored kingdom, the reaction from the French Republic was less than pleasant. The government in Marseille was quick to issue a statement condemning the coronation and referred to Henri VI as the \"false king of a German puppet state\". The Canadian government was similarly unimpressed and called on fellow Accord nations to not recognize the new kingdom.

Another proposal is directly moving against all identified suspects and arresting them in their homes.\n\nThe Troisième Bureau is also confident that the Accord is covertly supporting the radical students, and has proposed a third approach, which is enhancing surveillance on primary suspects, and the Canadian Embassy.

This was accompanied by another condemnation of Accord medding, stating that foreign interference would not be tolerated, and the purported spies would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nGermany has joined Northern France in condemning the Accord, and reiterated their support for Northern France in cracking down harder on the radical student movement.

Outside the Palace, officers are reporting that the crowd is growing more hostile, with calls to storm the Palace and 'Reclaim the country' being shouted.\n\nRiot police are standing by if necessary, but even their deployment would not guarantee security in the event of violence.

Police believe that the crowds are actively helping obfuscate the shooters, and refusing to condemn the violence.\n\nUnless there are immediate consequences, the tempo of these attacks will increase if the students think they can strike with impunity. Police are requesting authorization for lethal force, irrespective of the crowd.

We are confident that the worst is over, and the potential for a large-scale riot in Paris has passed. It does not seem likely that the numbers seen today will be replicated.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that this will be the end of the movement, today was perhaps the most dangerous moment in recent French history, and the fact that it passed without major incident is excellent news."

Enforcement would ensure that a critical mass could not form, strongly reducing the possibility of riots. Their second recommendation is simpler - to execute a mass arrest of all known student revolutionary leadership.\n\nOnly one of these can be feasibly executed, but the Bureau believes either will sufficiently reduce the threat the radical students pose. However, some within our government are displeased by how the Bureau has conducted themselves, and blame the current situation on them, believing their actions have only radicalized the students more.

Bureau officials state that more information will be revealed during the trials.\n\nWhat is certain is that these individuals will be unable to organize their protests behind bars, and because many of them held leadership roles in the movement, the radical students have almost certainly been dealt an organizational blow.

Similar reports are emerging from across the country, but the worst of the violence is concentrated in Paris.\n\nThe police have lost control of the situation, and military forces are preparing to enter the city and restore order, though it is unclear how long this will take, or what the necessary cost of lives will be.

While the city is secure for now, there were students and bystanders injured or killed during the brief violence.\n\nAs of now there are no indications that the students are attempting to rally or begin another march.

  fra_rev.33.d: "We have received alarming news from Paris and across Northern France - radical students and workers have announced the formation of local councils, which intend to assume governing roles in their respective areas. Militias have also been formed, which have declared their intent to protect these councils with lethal forces.\n\nBoth these militias and councils are appearing across the country, and there are reports that they have seized factories and some government buildings using the militias to secure them. Violence has been limited, but the intentions of these insurrectionists is clear - they seek the end of the Kingdom of France.\n\nWe must move quickly, because more councils are being announced every hour, and the momentum is with these traitorous revolutionaries. The councils and militias are calling upon all of France to join them, and topple our government. There can be no delay - we must crush this threat immediately!"
  fra_rev.33.a: "What is this, Russia?"

  fra_rev.34.t: "National Guard Units Defect"
  fra_rev.34.d: "Terrible news has reached us that significantly threatens our ability to deal with this growing insurrection by these councils and militias. Multiple units within the National Guard have defected to this so-called revolution, and thrown their support behind the councils, or are being actively integrated into revolutionary militias.\n\nThey have subsequently called upon their comrades and countrymen to join them, and expel our government with minimal violence. The defection of these soldiers appears to have further accelerated defections from local officials and soldiers to the revolutionaries, further weakening our authority across France.\n\nWe cannot delay our response any longer. Negotiation is out of the question, and every passing hour increases the chance that more soldiers and officials will defect to these revolutionaries. Their momentum must be arrested without delay! The military is mobilized, and ready for deployment. This threat must be crushed once and for all."

  fra_rev.35.d: "We have been closely monitoring the protests that are taking place across the Kingdom of France. French officials have finally provided reassurances that they are aware of the protests, and are taking steps to monitor and counter it. They are insisting that the Kingdom is in no danger.\n\nCurrently, there are a significant number of protestors currently marching through Paris, with estimates in the tens of thousands - far more than when the students began only hours earlier, indicating that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the current government. The French government has not officially commented yet, even as the protests have reached the Tuileries Palace.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the Kingdom of France could be facing a civil war or an armed insurrection if they mishandle the current situation - so we must make a choice of how to react. It may be appropriate to quietly prepare several border divisions in the event that the French lose control of the situation. Alternatively, as the French insist the situation is under control, we can trust that it is handled."

The people appear to be rapidly turning against the government, and it will likely take a single spark to light it aflame.\n\nThe opportunity to reunite France may be rapidly approaching. If Northern France descends into chaos, we would be well-positioned to invade and reclaim the territory stolen from us by the Germans. However, the protests have remained peaceful, and it is possible that these protests end without incident - and our military preparations will be something we have to answer for. No matter our choice, it must be made now."

While the revolutionaries have momentum, it is likely that if there is no intervention, they will be able to reclaim control, especially if Germany mobilizes to intervene.\n\nThe time for action is now. There is no better time to reunite France, as the Northern French forces would be unable to stop us - but we must consider the reaction of Germany. If Germany considers our reclamation a threat, they may invade on their own - and would not stop in Northern France. The future of France is at stake - we must decide carefully."

The French Republic has petitioned the Accord to authorize an invasion of the disunited Kingdom to reunite the French lands, and bring order to the region.\n\nWhile the Kingdom is a German puppet, and its fall would benefit the Accord there are significant risks that come with a joint invasion. Germany would almost certainly view an invasion of their puppet - one on their doorstep no less - as an unacceptable action, and we cannot discount the possibility that it will trigger a third Weltkrieg.\n\nHowever, a failure to act would effectively deny a chance of French reunification indefinitely, anger the French Republic, and effectively legitimize the Kingdom of France as a separate state that will be under permanent German influence. We must keep these factors in mind when casting our vote, and decide what is best for the future of the French Republic, the Accord, and the world itself."

The Kingdom of France has failed to suppress the French revolutionaries, and the entire country is at risk of falling to a mixture of Syndicalists and Accordist sympathizers.\n\nIt is almost certain that the French Republic is weighing an opportunity to invade from the south and reunite the country while the Kingdom is in chaos - which is an unacceptable outcome. While the Kingdom has utterly failed to contain the situation despite their assurances, they cannot be allowed to fall.\n\nWe are beginning mobilization of our military forces which will be able to quickly restore order and crush these revolutionaries. As concerns the Kingdom of France - their future will be decided once the situation is resolved, and peace once more restored."

  fra_rev.42.d: "Our observers in Paris have sent concerning reports indicating that there are large numbers of students actively gathering in the streets and executing a major march throughout the city. More concerning is the fact that these protests are reportedly swelling in size, with hundreds of Parisians joining the students and demanding concessions from the government.\n\nRight now the French government has not directly responded to the demands of the protesters, nor are they responding to our requests for clarification on the situation. It is clear that this protest is growing larger than the students, and while it appears to be largely peaceful, there is a concern that it will become violent.\n\nAs things stand, this is a poor indication of the support of the Kingdom from the average French citizen. The chants and slogans recorded seem to harken to previous revolutions, and it is clear they seek significant concessions from the government. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and act if necessary."

  fra_rev.43.d: "Sources and assets within the radical student movement and underground revolutionary cells have managed to share with us critical information on the actions of these dissidents - in particular, plans for a coming revolution against the standing government.\n\nThey believe that there is significant public discontent with the Kingdom of France, and that if they are able to appropriately organize, and mobilize the wider French public, they will be able to topple the Northern French government. While they hope to do this peacefully, they have admitted that this outcome is unlikely and these revolutionaries are preparing for violence.\n\nThese sources have passed this information to us in the hopes of encouraging additional support, and so that we can be prepared to intervene before Germany or the Reichspakt does. They do not know exactly when this revolution will happen, or many details - but they predict that it will be in the near future - and that Paris will be the catalyst."

  fra_rev.44.d: "Unfortunate news has reached us of operations executed by the Northern French security apparatus, which has surgically targeted activists across Northern France responsible for helping organize and coordinate the resistance against them.\n\nThese arrests have been widespread, targeted, and successful - greatly hindering the ability of the Northern French activists to organize against the government. While it isn't a death blow for the movement, it is a significant setback, even if a few of those targeted were able to escape.\n\nNorthern France appears to be taking the threat of the revolutionaries seriously, and executing appropriate steps to combat it. We must be cautious if we do not want our own involvement exposed, as it would almost certainly increase the legitimacy of the Kingdom, and hinder our ultimate efforts to undermine them."
  fra_rev.44.a: "A minor setback"

  fra_rev.45.t: "Activists and Rebels in North France are Cooperative"
  fra_rev.45.d: "We have received a response from the activists and students in Northern France that they have agreed to welcome support from the Accord in their efforts to topple the Kingdom of France. While it does not appear that it is unreserved support, they appear to understand that their chances of success greatly improve with us backing them.\n\nWhile the risks of discovery will increase as we begin to more closely coordinate with the activists, it will also allow them to far better prepare and organize than before. Intelligence officers are embedding themselves in cells, officials are making plans with activist leadership, and resources and weapons are already being distributed.\n\nWhen the time comes to strike when the Kingdom is weakest, we will know well ahead of time, and be able to take advantage of the resulting situation. It will require delicacy and competence, but we are confident that victory can be achieved. Soon, the Kingdom of France will fall, and France will be reunited!"

  FRA_civil_relief_programs_desc: "After the Second Weltkrieg, to consolidate occupation holdings and to improve relations with the \"liberated\" French, civil relief programs were put in place by von Bock's administration. The programs have allowed for the funding of the economic recovery of North France from the Second Weltkrieg, benefiting both the French and administration that governs them.\n\nSince 1946, the results of these programs have been mixed, though the programs are enough for the French, although bitter about the occupation, are content enough to not slit the throats of their occupiers at night."

To make matters worse, the Syndicalist rule in France meant that they had almost no base of private industry.

Destitution and illicit trade are commonplace in the cities, agriculture is paralysed with farms being left unattended and in a state of disrepair. The remaining elements of the French Resistance will not hesitate to capitalise on popular discontent to sow chaos and upend the ongoing reconstruction efforts.
