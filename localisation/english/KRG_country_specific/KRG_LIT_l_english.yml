LIT_oneandahalf_party: "One-and-a-Half Party System"
LIT_oneandahalf_party_desc: "In theory, Lithuania is the one true democracy in the Reichspakt, a beacon of liberalism and democratic thought in an otherwise grim political landscape of Eastern Europe. However, ever since 1920, only one party has held the reins of power - the Christian Democrats, commanding a seemingly invincible bloc which always receives a majority of the vote. Opposition parties exist and are not persecuted, but hold no chance of taking power either.\n\nThe focus of Lithuanian politics has since turned towards the Bloc itself - divided between various factions, it is a party system of its own right, and whichever faction earns to dominate it will end up dominating Lithuania as well."
LIT_optimal_system: "The Optimal System?"
LIT_optimal_system_desc: "Taking power in Lithuania in 1937, Stasys Šalkauskis reformed the Lithuanian political system from the ground up. Parliamentary democracy has been replaced by a complex, corporatist democratic system, with three houses of Parliament, which aims to represent the person \"physically, culturally and spiritually\". To this day, the study of the Lithuanian political system is the bane of any political studies freshman.\n\nHowever, it is not as optimal as it seems. After Šalkauskis's passing, his successors had to complete the project by themselves, and while it all seemed to work fine and the Kingdom was harmonious, the Second Weltkrieg and the integration of Belarus have revealed its faults. Once again, the tree of liberty needs to be renewed."
LIT_toll_of_war: "The Toll of War"
LIT_toll_of_war_desc: "Lithuania was in the front lines of the Second Weltkrieg. The Russians came, they looted and requisitioned to fuel their war machine, and only when the Germans returned did some semblance of peace finally return. Everyone agrees that reconstruction must take place before any ventures inwards or outwards."

krg_lit_news.0.t: "The Ruthenian Divorce"
krg_lit_news.0.d: "Global politics was taken somewhat by surprise with the declaration of the United Kingdom of Lithuania-Belarus, and many said it was doomed to fail.\n\nThose who did can put a feather in their cap on this day, as the Lithuanian government has proven incapable of maintaining amicable relations over the Belarusian half of the country. As such the nation has agreed on a settlement of division, and Lithuanian dreams of greater statehood seem to be permanently buried, with Kiryl Mazurau (pictured centre here) coming to lead the new state of [BLR.GetName]."
krg_lit_news.0.d2: "With Ruthenia originally being taken over by the Lithuania following the Russian invasion, it should come to no surprise that they once again wish for independence\n\nThose who did can put a feather in their cap on this day, as the Lithuanian government has proven incapable of maintaining amicable relations over the Belarusian half of the country.

krg_lit_news.1.d: "With the accession of Ruthenian territories into Lithuanian control after recent events, the Lithuanian government has coordinated with and organised the territory of Belarus into a secondary kingdom after initially cooperating with local political elements who had formed a 'Belarusian Central Council' in Minsk (pictured).\n\nGiven ambitions in the region, and the legacy of the Commonwealth in Lithuanian political circles, they have decided to declare a personal union between the two kingdoms under King Vytautus. It is unclear whether this is nothing more than an echo of an ancient legacy, or the start of something new."
