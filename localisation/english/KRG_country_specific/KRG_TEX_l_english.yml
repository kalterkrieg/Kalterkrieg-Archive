TEX_legacy_of_the_kingfish: "Legacy of the Kingfish"
TEX_legacy_of_the_kingfish_desc: "On May 18th 1943, President Huey Long found himself the target of an unpatriotic and cowardly assassin. He was struck down and, with such a massive hit to our administration. Yet despite his untimely demise, we took his ideas, his charisma, and we were inspired to continue his work. Now, with the Union State secure, the legacy of 'The Kingfish' shall see us prevail. His legacy onto our nation is eternal."   
TEX_reconstruction: "The Beginning of Reconstruction" 
TEX_reconstruction_desc: "For any proud American, the current state of America has become a living nightmare; devastated after over a decade of constant conflict. Yet, unlike the first Civil War, there is no longer a united American state. Formerly rightful American territory is now owned by four separate powers. It is a tragedy beyond words. Out of all the nations, we Union states have the best chance to end this nightmare and bring back America from it's waking slumber. But even across our nation, a feeling of  'What if America never wakes?' remains."

TEX_lost_generation: "The Lost Generation" 
TEX_lost_generation_desc: "There is a hole in our Union, a demographic one. The war has burnt through the Union's men, and left little in its wake. While many small children run amok in war torn yards and the elderly sit on the same yards watching their grandchildren, factories, mines, and store all lay idle. Much of our workforce lie in the dirt somewhere in the Midwest, rotting. Even with as women try as they might to fill this hole, it's not enough. We cannot fill this hole ourselves, the only power which can fill it, is father time."
TEX_demoralized_military: "Demoralized Military" 
TEX_demoralized_military_desc: "As the American Civil War has ground to a stalemate and the Union troops pouring into the last remaining hideouts of the syndicalist menace, the troops should be ecstatic! Yet, they are just as grim as the war itself. While few have been mobilized for all 11 years, they have done enough, the war having taken its psychological toll. The men are tired, sick of seeing their comrades and friends fall by syndicalist terrorists and random accidents. In the eyes of these troops, the fighting has been over for years. At the start, they may have been eager to take up arms and fight for the Kingfish's dream, but now all they want is to put down their weapons and be done with it all."

These laws became harsher as the Socialist Party of America began to gain momentum. However, these laws did not prove enough to stop the rise of socialism in the United States.\n\nNow, years after the Civil War, it has proven even further necessary to re-introduce such laws in order to destroy the Syndicalist Menace once and for all!"

For the duration of the Civil War, it was not considered necessary to have a centralized military. This decision may have prevented us from finishing the war the first time around. With the recently established Union Army, we need to ensure that it is up to par with the recent of the world."

tex.1.t: "The State of the Union Address"
tex.1.d: "Amidst the winds of change and the formidable challenges that lay ahead, President Earl K. Long strides purposefully before the assembled Congress to delivers his annual State of the Union address.\n\nRecognizing the mounting economic concerns of the people, President Long proposes the establishment of Social Security, a comprehensive safety net for the vulnerable. His compassionate vision seeks to alleviate the hardships faced by the unemployed, the impoverished, and the elderly, forging a society rooted in solidarity and empathy.\n\nTurning his attention to the arteries that connect the nation, President Long unveils an audacious plan for an extensive infrastructure system. He envisions a vast network of highways that will span the length and breadth of the Union States, serving as conduits of progress and unity. This ambitious endeavor will not only stimulate commerce and trade but also foster a sense of national cohesion, binding the American people together in a common purpose.\n\nAs President Earl K. Long concludes his address to Congress, the air is thick with anticipation. The future of the Union hangs in the balance, guided by a leader who envisions a path paved with re-election, Social Security, an extensive infrastructure network, and the vigilant registration of Syndicalists. Only time will reveal whether this vision will withstand the tumultuous tides of history or succumb to the winds of change."

tex.2.t: "The Mountaintop Insurgency is Crushed"
tex.2.d: "In a resounding display of determination and resolve, the last bastion of American Syndicalism has been utterly vanquished, putting an end to its lingering presence within the rugged peaks of the West Virginian mountains. The beleaguered remnants of this once-proud movement, which had stubbornly clung to their ideals since the tumultuous year of 1937, have now met their ultimate fate.\n\nFor years, these diehard syndicalists had sought refuge in the inhospitable terrain, their isolated enclaves serving as a testament to their unwavering commitment to the cause. Despite the changing tides of history and the inexorable advance of opposing forces, they clung to their vision of a radically restructured society, where workers would stand at the helm of the nation.\n\nAs the echoes of the past fade into obscurity, the nation will be left to ponder the consequences of this pivotal moment. Will the defeat of American Syndicalism serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of radical ideologies, or will it ignite a new flame of dissent, fueled by the embers of a lost cause? Only time will tell."
tex.2.a: "The last remnant of American Syndicalism, snuffed out."
tex.3.t: "The Mountaintop Insurgency Succeeds"
tex.3.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the ominous specter of American Syndicalism has reared its head once again, inflicting a devastating blow upon the nation within the rugged peaks of the West Virginian mountains. Against all reason and sanity, the proponents of this treacherous ideology have managed to seize power, plunging the land into an abyss of chaos and despair.\n\nLike a dark cloud descending upon the land, the syndicalists' resurgence has cast a pall of uncertainty over the nation, shattering the foundations of stability and order. Their mountain strongholds, once mere remnants of a fading ideology, have now transformed into fortresses of tyranny and oppression, where the twisted dreams of radicalism take root.\n\nAs the nation trembles under the weight of this disastrous turn of events, the future appears bleak and uncertain. Will the people rise against this suffocating regime, reclaiming their freedom and restoring sanity, or will they be condemned to a never-ending nightmare of a society ravaged by the twisted tenets of syndicalism? Only time will reveal the true extent of this catastrophic blight upon the nation."
tex.3.a: "The Spirit of Blair Mountain lives on."
tex.4.t: "The Fifth Anniversary of the Kingfish's Assassination"
tex.4.d: "On May 18th 1943, a day which would undoubtedly go down in history, Huey Pierce Long, dubbed the 'imperial president' of the American Union State, gave one of his signature passionate speeches in Baton Rouge. All seemed normal, no one in the crowd imagined a dirty syndicalist dog or federalist bounty hunter could be lurking among them, after all Louisiana was far from the frontlines and the heart of the Kingfish's movement. Yet one was, and wasn't long before a gunshot rang out.\n\nAlmost immediately the American Union State was neutered, the war in the north ground to a halt as a confused officer corps made sense of the reports from the capital, and a government-wide state of mourning was put in place for all territories under the banner of the America First Party, loyal or not. People from all walks of life arrived in the city where their savior was shot and killed, and the streets were soon filled with weeping citizens who couldn't accept that their beloved leader was truly gone."
tex.4.a: "We will remember him."
tex.5.t: "North Carolina Militia Units up for Review"
tex.5.d: "Our military has been oversized since the end of the civil war. The military has justified it as necessary to suppress the syndicalist remnants in the steel belt, but with few incidents in the last few years, it has become harder and harder to justify such a huge waste of funds, especially with the economic situation so dire. The general staff has presented us with three options for each state's militia divisions. We can keep these units around, converting them into modern, well-equipped army divisions. We can disband them but allow our veterans to join the Civilian Conservation Corps in their state. This will be just as expensive as paying them to be soldiers, but would allow us to build infrastructure and work on other projects to stimulate economic growth. Or, we could disband them and refuse to pay them, which would definitely anger these men. Disbanding too many of them could lead to further violence and unrest."

tex.100.t: "President Holt is dead!"
tex.100.t2: "Senator Holt is dead!"
tex.100.t3: "Former President Holt is dead!"
tex.100.d: "Sad news from Louisiana this Morning as President Rush Holt passed away after a struggle with cancer. With his victory in the 1952 Presidential Election, Holt was considered crucial to the cohesion of the Conservative Wing and continued to push for these policies. Unlike Strom Thurmond's \"Dixiecrats\" Holt championed isolationist policies, and pushed more conservative members of his faction to favor compromise over reversal with regards to Share Our Wealth. With his death, the ascension of the Dixiecrats within the Conservative Wing that began with his electoral defeat appears to have been cemented, as no members of the \"center-right\" seem poised to contest them. Without any opposition within the faction, many expect Thurmond and his group will work to shift the Conservatives' focus entirely towards a reversal of Share Our Wealth and deeper ties with the Reichspakt. Such policies would be unpopular with the more center-right members of the wing, and some pundits are even predicting an internal crisis may be facing the Conservatives in the coming years."
tex.100.d2: "Sad news from West Virginia this Morning as Senator Rush Holt passed away after a struggle with cancer. Though his leadership position within the Conservative Wing of the AFP had been largely eclipsed by avowed \"Dixiecrat\" Strom Thurmond, Holt was seen by many as the glue that held the faction together, uniting hard right and center-right members into a cohesive opposition. Across his political career, Holt strongly advocated for isolationism, and pushed more conservative members of his faction to favor compromise over reversal with regards to Share Our Wealth. With his death, no center-right members of the wing appear to have filled the void he left, leaving leadership roles in among the Conservatives entirely in the hands of the \"Dixiecrats\". Without any opposition within the faction, many expect they will work to shift the Conservatives' focus entirely towards a reversal of Share Our Wealth and deeper ties with the Reichspakt. Such policies would be unpopular with the more center-right members of the wing, and some pundits are even predicting an internal crisis may be facing the Conservatives in the coming years."
tex.100.d3: "Sad news from West Virginia this Morning as former President Rush Holt passed away after a struggle with cancer. Although his defeat in the 1952 Presidential Election was seen by many as a repudiation of his policies, Holt was still considered crucial to the cohesion of the Conservative Wing.

tex.101.t: "President Long is dead!"
tex.101.t2: "'Uncle' Earl is dead!"
tex.101.d: "The death of Earl K. Long comes to a surprise to many, having served the post of Presidency since his brother's assassination in 1942, he is now among his brother once more. His achievements will without doubt serve to generations to come, and he shall be forever remembered as 'Uncle Earl'.\n\nHis Vice President, [KRG_PRIME_MINISTER], is expected to step into the position as President of the [TEX.GetName] and continue his policies."
tex.101.d2: "With the death of 'Uncle' Earl, a man who took upon the role of the Presidency upon his brother's assassination in 1942, he walks once again with his brother. The achievements during his presidency will without doubt serve to generations to come, and he shall be forever remembered as 'Uncle Earl'.\n\nPutting aside their differences, President [TEX.GetLeader] stated that he is sadden by the news of the death of Uncle Earl and that he sends the regards to Long's wife."
tex.101.a: "May he rest in peace"
tex.101.b: "Let's put our differences aside"
tex.101.c: "He served us well!"
tex.102.t: "The American Dilemma?"
tex.102.d: "A Swedish economist, Gunnar Myrdal, has recently published an analysis of the conditions our black citizens live under. In it, he not only suggested that the white population of the Union State is actually causing this, but also that it may be necessary to 'improve' their circumstances. Even more radical, he proposed another solution by which white citizens have to discard their own prejudices to fix the situation. Throughout more than 1400 pages, Myrdal rattled on about the value of proper democracy in ensuring equal and fair conditions - as though to imply our own presidential system is undemocratic! Some political groups within the Union State - particularly the Progressives and some Orthodox members - have embraced this work; they call for new reforms to be made and our country changed using this study as a model. Others, mostly amongst the Conservative and Orthodox factions, decry it as the work of a foreign meddler: what does this Swede know about constitutional implementation? Whichever way public opinion turns, so too must turn our policy on what is rapidly becoming known as the fledgling Civil Rights Movement."
tex.102.a: "Civil what, again?"
tex.102.b: "He's right!"
tex.103.t: "Field Marshall Devers retires"
tex.103.d: "A well-respected and well-liked field marshal, Jacob Devers, has now announced his retirement. Having served since 1909, he has been a firm installment in both our own army and formerly that of the Federal government. With the forty years he has given the military, though only seeing combat during the Civil War, this has certainly been well-earned. Of course, as the marshal in charge of our strategy for counter-insurgency operations, this may well weaken our military's future capacity."
tex.103.a: "That Syndie sniper may be missing him for sure..."
tex.105.t: "The Formation of NASCAR"
tex.105.d: "Inaugurated today by William \"Big Bill\" France in Daytona Beach, Florida, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the culmination of efforts to create a single professional body to oversee stock auto racing. Initially popularized by Appalachian thrill-seekers, the sport took on new life in the Second Civil War as drivers used their skills to transport refugees, perform reconnaissance, and smuggle black market items that were otherwise unavailable to most. In the postwar period, the sport took on a more professional character, despite persistent rumors of smuggling over the Rockies. Drivers shifted from racing against the law to racing for entertainment.\n\nDespite this, the sport remained unregulated, and drivers often found themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous organizers. In response, French met with influential figures in the circuit to form an association to oversee the sport, resulting in NASCAR. While based in the Union State, talks have already begun with Bob \"Barky\" Barkhimer to start an associate organization in the Pacific States."
tex.105.a: "Start Your Engines!"
tex.106.t: "First NASCAR race"
tex.106.d: "The inaugural \"Strictly Stock\" NASCAR race was held today at Charlotte Speedway to the roar of both engines and fans. The long awaited race in the sport's most anticipated division took place after a year-long delay, caused by shortage of supply in the face of post-war demand. NASCAR organizers had their hopes pinned on this race after the body's \"Roadster\" division was canceled due to unpopularity. To their relief, turnout was even higher than expected with 13000 in attendance, 5000 more than the track's legal accommodation!\n\nBill Blair held lead for most of the race, but was overtaken by Jim Roper and Glenn Dunaway on lap 151, with Dunaway finishing in first. However, in an unexpected turn of events, illegal modifications were discovered on Dunaway's car after officials expressed suspicion regarding his handling on the track's notoriously rugged turns. After some deliberation Dunaway was disqualified and Roper was given the win. Despite the controversy, the event was wildly successful for NASCAR, and founder Bill French has scheduled additional races across the country."

tex.107.t: "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male Published"
tex.107.d: "Founder of the Institute of Sex Research at Indiana University Alfred Kinsey and colleagues Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin have recently published a new groundbreaking book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. The book, which analyzes data from approximately 5,300 males over a fifteen-year period, has seemingly exploded in popularity and garnered widespread media attention, thanks both to its novel findings and its controversial nature. It suggests that that homosexuality is much more prevalent than previously thought and freely discusses in detail a range of other taboo sexual topics. It also introduces the Kinsey Scale, used to measure a person's degrees of heterosexuality and homosexuality.\n\nThe book has prompted both strong societal backlash and academic criticism, with the latter mostly targeting Kinsey's methodology. Nonetheless, it has already made a lasting impact on the sexual culture of America."
tex.107.a: "10%? Yeah, sure..."
tex.108.t: "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female Published"
tex.108.d: "In what is dubbed to be one of the most recent controversial publications, Alfred Kinsey has published his sequel to Sexual Behavior in the Human Male from 1948. The books themselves are a series of statistics based on a selection of 100,000 volunteers who answered questions on taboo subjects such as their orientation. The publications would list out a gender group and then the age bracket and the percentage of that age bracket of a particular sexuality using the 7-point \"Kinsey Scale.\"\n\nThe publications have received a large amount of criticism for their methodology such as the self-selection bias, volunteer bias, and the use of prison populations and pedophiles as interviewees.\n\nDespite the criticisms the book has already been significant in changing academic perceptions on sexuality and is already being printed in the tens of thousands."
tex.108.a: "Seems like the times are a changing..."
tex.109.t: "The Silent Killer of Donora"
tex.109.d: "The town of Donora, Pennsylvania was finally released from nightmarish conditions this week, when rain dissipated a deadly smog that left 50 dead and 14,000 severely ill. The acrid yellow fog was thought to be caused by emissions from the local Union Steel plant combined with a rare weather anomaly. As the smog became more dense over the week, driving in town became impossible, and local doctors were so overwhelmed that the Red Cross had to step in to assist relief efforts. So far, Union Steel has declined to take any responsibility, claiming the smog was an \"act of god\" caused by several sources rather than their plant alone. Regardless of blame, the disaster has sparked debate among Union State politicians on whether national air quality regulations are needed to prevent a repeat incident." 
tex.109.a: "An \"Act of God\"? Doubtful."
tex.110.t: "Cow Garners National Media"
tex.110.d: "An Oklahoman Hereford Cow named Grady caught the national media spotlight when it became stuck in a grain silo after forcing its way through a small opening. Bill Mach, the cow's owner, was unable to remove Grady without tearing down the valuable silo, and posted a request for help in his local newspaper. He received a response that was both unexpected and overwhelming when people from across the country, and even one farmer in Berlin, offered input on how to remove Grady from her predicament. In the end Mach went with the advice of Ralph Partridge, farming editor of the Denver Post, who suggested coating the cow with axle grease. After tranquilizers were administered, Mach and several neighbors pulled the coated Hereford through the opening unharmed. Both Mach and Grady have become local celebrities as a result of the fiasco."
tex.110.a: "Holy Cow!"
tex.111.t: "Riots in Englewood"
tex.111.d: "What started out as a biracial Union Meeting in Chicago turned into a Race Riot that would injure over a dozen people. Originally starting as a meeting between Black and White Workers of Chicago would draw the attention of the local white community. The Neighbors believing they were organizing a syndicalist agitation, asked the workers to leave, to which they refused.\n\nThe result was that a mob of up to 10,000 people would destroy the house the meeting was held in and go throughout the town beating Black citizens and White citizens who were thought to be syndicalist outsiders throughout the streets. The Police under Mayor Kennelly were heavily criticized for the police's lack of action against the rioters and reported encouragement of the rioters. Mayor Kennelly has been reported to have refused any comments on the \"disturbances\".\n\nAnalysts believe this is part of a larger wave of riots in the growing civil rights movement opposed to racial segregation and injustice within the Union."
tex.111.a: "Please Remain Calm!"
tex.112.t: "Riots in Cicero"
tex.112.d: "What was supposed to be the Clark's family simply moving into a neighborhood turned into a full blown race riot. As a result of the Clark's family moving into an apartment in Chicago. The result of which garnered an entire white mob to surround the house and stone it, numbering in 4,000 rioters.\n\nWhile the police and fireman were dispatched to stop the rioting it would take the Illinois State Guard and Minutemen militias to form a perimeter around the Clark's house. Their efforts would only stop the rioting 3 days later.\n\nWhile cases like Cicero did occur, they weren't covered much on television or national newspapers. However due to the extensive coverage of the event it reached worldwide fame. The Union government has received wide condemnation from civil rights groups and governments across the world. The Chicago police themselves received the most critical criticisms for their failed handling of the situation and protection of the Clark Family. In the aftermath of the event the Union government has been getting more spotlight on their racial situation which might promote some needed change of the situation..."
tex.112.a: "We need to do something about these riots..."
tex.113.t: "No Reports of Lynching"
tex.113.d: "In a case that surprised many civil rights analysts and black rights groups like the NAACP and Tuskugee Institute within the Union there seems to have been no lynching case within the nation.\n\nLynchings, which were a staple of Southern US states since the end of the first Civil War to enforce Jim Crow laws, have been frequently reported in the years following the Civil War and went unabated through the Second Civil War. However, with the migration of the Black Population to the Rust Belt, combined with the return to the rule of law, general disdain for racism, and the increasing scrutiny of civil rights groups with the turn of the half century have been cited as factors for the decrease in lynchings.\n\nRegardless, the Union government has cited this as proof of their increased race relations situation despite many doubts. It can be said now that we might be turning to the century where racism is on the decrease."
tex.113.a: "This year might just be our year!"
tex.114.t: "Violence at College Game"
tex.114.d: "During a college game between the Drake Bulldogs and Oklahoma A&M Aggies, quarterback Johnny Bright of the Drake Bulldogs was first knocked unconscious three times and had his jaw broken by opponent Wilbanks Smith.\n\nAccording to Des Moines Register reporter Bob Spiegel, the Coach of the Oklahoma A&M told his team to take down Johnny Bright while spouting racial slurs.\n\nIn the end, the Oklahoma A&M Aggies won the game by 27-14."
tex.114.a: "Violence is part of the game!"
tex.115.t: "Great Flood of 1951"
tex.115.d: "Disaster continues to befall the midwest as unseasonal rains have swelled the Missouri and Kansas rivers beyond capacity, causing nearly a billion dollars in damages and thousands left homeless. The flooding began in May, around the town of Hays when an unprecedented 11 inches of rain across two hours caused Big Creek to overflow and put the community under four feet of standing water. As the unusually high rainfall continued throughout the summer, wide swaths of the Kansas River Basin were affected, destroying much of Fort Riley and downtown Manhattan, Kansas. 39,000 people total had to be evacuated between Topeka and Kansas City to escape the flooding, and 17 deaths have been recorded so far. Observing the disaster by airplane, President [TEX.GetLeader] called it \"one of the worst this country has ever suffered from water\" and vowed the construction of new Levees would immediately begin to prevent this from ever happening again."
tex.115.a: "Send aid to Kansas and Missouri!"
tex.116.t: "Water Tank breaks in New Mexico"
tex.116.d: "In a tragic and damaging incident, a water tank in Tucumcari, New Mexico has collapsed. Four deaths have been reported along with several more minor injuries, and over 200 buildings in the area have been destroyed. Union State officials in the region predict that rebuilding the damage will only take a few months, however, and those displaced have received minor financial compensation for their trouble."
tex.116.a: "Let's hope the water supply remains stable."
tex.117.t: "Storm hits Florida"
tex.117.d: "Reports coming in from the National Hurricane Center have confirmed our worst fears: Hurricane Florence, having originated from the tropically active Caribbean sea, is now heading for landfall at Fort  Walton Beach and Panama city, with estimates that it will reach the status of a Category 3 Hurricane.\n\nAlready tens of thousands of people have been warned to evacuate from the perimeter of the eye of the storm, but that hasn't stopped the storm from causing untold damages onto local infrastructure without having even reached its climax point, with it projected to head further up the coastline. Whatever the damages  may be, however, it is of paramount importance to the stability of our magnanimous nation that we won't allow one soul to be lost to this travesty of mother nature."
tex.117.a: "Send aid to Florida!"
tex.118.t: "Tornado hits Mississippi"
tex.118.d: "As the seismic weather that has crippled Floridian infrastructure, and has seen the displacements of thousands to other states in order to escape it's deadly ire, reports from Mississippi have proven that our other states will not be spared so easily, with the local Governor telephoning the President, stating that \"Florida isn't the only damned state that needs assistance, signs of the interstate highways are flying across Jackson as we speak!\". \n\nAlthough a rather obtuse response that has ruffled the feathers of our leader, we must take head of their pleas for assistance, lest we let even more lives be at risk."
tex.118.a: "Send aid to Mississippi!"
tex.119.t: "Tornado hits Texas"
tex.119.d: "As the Tropical Hurricane continues to grow exponentially in size and weight, and although projected to go up the coastline from Georgia before dissipating into the Atlantic, this has not spare the Lone star state from it's clutches, with reports coming in of Dallas being in knee deep floods, with startling images of both Upper and Lower Class neighbourhoods having makeshift boats in order to keep their families afloat. \n\n Although not being in direct contact with the eye of the storm, Texan infrastructure is particularly at risk of damage, given that most tropical weather does not hit the so called \"sunny side state\" making it ever more damaging that the effects of the storm have even reached as far as it has, and given our economy being economically dependent on Texan oil refineries, it would be foolish not to help the largest state within the union."
tex.119.a: "Send aid to Texas!"
tex.120.t: "Hurricane Strikes North Carolina"
tex.120.d: "With the continued ballooning of the hurricane, what is deemed the meteorological climax has unfavourably hit North Carolina, with the storm officially reaching a type 3 cattegory Tornado, with the capital of Brunswick having already reported casualties well into the hunderds. Coupled with rain that has flooded many towns and villages, up to 90mm of water on the ground, and speeds of 150 miles per hour wreaking havoc on the state, any hesitation to take action now will not only bite Georgians in the ass, but also our image as protectors of the states within the union will wither away."
tex.120.a: "Send aid to North Carolina!"
tex.121.t: "Comet Sighted!"
tex.121.d: "In what can only be described as a meteorological anomaly, this week an eight pound chunk of meteorite crashed through the roof of Ann Hodges, an Alabama resident, as she napped. Though it damaged her radio cabinet and left a painful bruise, Hodges was relatively unscathed by the incident, which marks the first time in recorded history an object from outer space has directly struck a human being. Though the meteorite was claimed by local law enforcement after the event, a heated legal battle seems to be ramping up as Hodges and her husband vy for ownership of the space debris against their landlord, Bertie Guy, who claims that the meteorite is hers by right as it landed on her property."
tex.121.a: "If only we had comet sense..."
tex.122.t: "Tornadoes hit Mississippi"
tex.122.d: "As many have grasped the dire situation of this hellish storm, it now seems that even Mississippi has been hit in its crosshair, though mostly the coastlines have only been impacted, with the interior being out of the eye of the storms trajectory, though this hasn't stopped cases of strong winds uprooting trees in Jackson and other neighbouring cities.\n\nAs the coastlines of Mississippi largely rely on fishing and transport raw resources such as cotton and soybeans through the Caribbean to other neighbouring states and foreign markets, the impact of the storm has been utterly devastating to the Mississippian economy, with the state governor requesting immediate aid in order to soften the fall in the local economy, and to mobilize the national army and state militias to clear debris and transport materials to and from the state, promising that this would be a net positive by easing current price hikes on clothes and agricultural products due to the storm's disruptance of supply chains."
tex.122.a: "Send aid to Mississippi!"
tex.123.t: "Hurricane hits North Carolina"
tex.123.d: "Although the worst of the Hurricane has now begun to dissipate, as it is on curse to depress into the Atlantic, that does not mean the chaos brought forth by it has yet ended.\n\nLike it's southern brethren, the state has been unprepared for the devastation of the storm, as cities like Charlotte and Raleigh have experienced heavy rain showers followed by winds at a dissipated, but still fiercely violent 100 miles per hour, along with the coastal cities, such as Wilmington, reporting cases of furniture flowing into the near endless solace of the Atlantic ocean. Although the travesty of the storm has reached its end point, diligence is still required in order to maintain cohesion and stability in the union states."

tex.124.d: "A six-year-old boy, Bobby Greenlease, has been kidnapped from Kansas City, Missouri. This week his body was found in Lenexa, Kansas, despite his father paying out the largest ransom in American history. The government and police force has come under heavy criticism for failing to manage the incident, and the death has drawn media coverage from across the Union State."
tex.124.a: "What a terrible tragedy."
tex.125.t: "Black Girl Refuses to Give Up Seat"
tex.125.d: "In a locally shocking move, a female passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery. In Montgomery due to Jim Crow laws and Segregationist practices it was custom and even law for black passengers to give their seats to white passengers. However an incident occurred when teenage Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat when a white passenger came on the overcrowded bus.\n\nColvin would get arrested by Montgomery Police and be tried for disturbing the peace and violating segregation laws. The NAACP has made sure that will be her defense and organize her case and appeal to higher courts. Analysts in the Union have made comments that this incident is only a part of a larger wave of the increasing civil rights movement and only more incidents of resistance will occur. "

tex.126.t: "Murder of Emmett Till"
tex.126.d: "The nation is gripped in shock as news spread over the death of teenage black boy. While on vacation in August of Mississippi Emmett TIll was reported to have \"whistled\" at a white woman which is an extreme taboo in Jim Crow regions of the South. The result was that Emmett Till would be abducted and would be subjected to mutilation and torture and then being shot and thrown into the river where his body was found 3 days later.\n\nPerpetrators of the murder were caught but were acquitted with an all-white jury with no consequences what so ever. The ensuing aftermath resulted in dozens of sporadic upsets and protests from the Black Belt of his murder and the murderer's acquittal. Emmett Till's mother insisted on an open-casket to show how mutilated her child was.\n\nForeign observers and nations scoff at us and look in horror as our rivals in the Pacific States, Great Lakes, and New England use this to demonstrate their superiority over us. Sooner or later we will have to solve the Jim Crow Problem otherwise it will hamper our internal situation even further."

tex.127.t: "Montgomery Bus Boycott"
tex.127.d: "As a result of segregation within the Bus systems of Montgomery Alabama the Civil Rights movement organized a large boycott of the entire Montgomery Bus System. Organized by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who has been linked to the growing Civil Rights Movement, the bus boycott occurred in the immediate aftermath of the arrest of Rosa Parks, a black woman who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on the Bus. Rosa Parks cites the memory of the recently deceased Emmett Till as for her reason to not leave her seat. The Reverend has also worked with the NAACP to appeal her case. The boycott has so far brought nationwide attention to segregation and Jim Crow within the Union. This has brought further scrutiny to our government for our poor rights of the black population within the Union. Our rivals in the Pacific and New England have capitalized on these events to highlight how immoral and corrupt our nation is. We might have to act soon before the Civil Rights Movement becomes out of control."

tex.128.t: "Montgomery Improvement Association Founded"
tex.128.d: "A new organization which has been brought to the limelight of the Civil Rights Movement for its role in the organization of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Montgomery Improvement Association has been founded in the aftermath of Rosa Park's arrest for not complying with Bus Segregation. While the bus segregation court case is being appealed to the Supreme Court the MIA has organized a city-wide boycott of the Montgomery Busses and organized biking commuting, carpools, black taxi men who charge cheap prices, and simply walking as alternatives.\n\nThe rapid mobilization of the group can be attributed through the organization of black Churches in the Union mainly through one of its founders, Martin Luther King Jrs connections and sermons within the black community. The result was the rapid mobilization and unity of the black community within Montgomery for the cause.\n\nThe Montgomery Government has attempted to fight back by passing legislation to raise taxi prices and arrest boycott leaders for \"disturbing the peace\" to little success. Our advisors cite that this organization could be used as a template for further boycotts throughout the nation."

tex.129.d: "In a surprising victory for the Civil Rights Movement, the Supreme Court of the Union has deemed that bus segregation within the state of Alabama is unconstitutional and has ordered the state to desegregate its buses. In what is perhaps one of the most important cases in the history of the Union that overturned decades old segregation and Jim Crow within the Union and invalidated Plessy v. Ferguson which previously justified racial segregation under the rule of \"separate but equal.\"\n\nThe case was the culmination of decades worth of Civil RIghts activism and legal battles to push segregation to become illegal by Civil RIghts groups. This particular court case was caused by Rosa Parks' arrest and later appeal for her refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on the bus.\n\nThis case is now becoming the turning point as our advisors predict that segregation is going to be pushed out of the Union through ensuing legal battles and advise us to abandon to quickly make a decision on the Civil Rights issue."

tex.131.d: "An explosive story has emerged from the Union Senate as the Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, otherwise known as the Kefauver Committee, came to its final conclusions. Named for its leading senator, Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, the body found ample evidence for the existence of Italian-American crime \"families\" across the country, the largest of which operates out of Chicago. The committee also found that similar organizations could have an even tighter grip on crime in New England and that there may exist international networks between criminals in Chicago, New York City, and Boston. The primary income of these groups appear to be illegal gambling and protection rackets, and in response the Senate recommended the creation of a federal \"Racket Squad\" alongside more stringent gambling bans across the states."

While by no means the first \"Girlie mag\" to hit newsstands, founder Hugh Hefner has attributed the magazine's smash success to its attempt to combine thoughtful interviews and current events pieces with nude centerfolds in a single publication, creating something more sophisticated than its \"gross and tasteless\" competition. Despite a more upscale attitude, the magazine has not escaped the ire of conservative interest groups across the country, decrying Playboy as one of the prime examples of moral corruption in modern society. Nonetheless, these criticisms have done little to hamper Hefner's sales, and while he was unsure of whether a second issue would even be published, this success has already led to talks of distribution in New England and the Pacific States."

Polio, which in 1954 alone killed more children than any other disease in the country, now has the potential to be effectively eradicated by mass immunization in what many scientists are calling the most significant medical achievement of the 20th century so far. The success of the vaccine trials have catapulted Dr. Salk into the spotlight as an unexpected celebrity, with his face and achievements being recognized nationwide.

Prior to its official release, \"That's All Right!\" was first played on Memphis Radio and received so much interest that the DJ decided to play it on repeat for two hours straight.

tex.2000.d: "Today, the Supreme Court of the American Union State sees a case with the potential to decide the future of discriminatory housing practices, a strong feature among many communities seeking to prevent minority groups from residing there. The case, known as \"Shelley v. Kramer\", comes to the court from the state of Missouri regarding the sale of a house under a racial covenant. The prospective buyers, an African-American family by the name of Shelley, sought to buy a house that they were not aware was under a racial covenant which prevented them from purchasing the property. Kramer, a neighbor down the street, filed the case in order to prevent them from purchasing the property.\n\nWhile the Missouri State Supreme Court upheld the covenant, the case was appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds of the covenant violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The Shelleys, represented by several prominent African-American attorneys, claim that the covenant is indeed unconstitutional, discrimination by the courts in a way that violates the Fourteenth Amendment. While this argument does hold some merit, their opposition argues that entering such a covenant is voluntary and thus cannot fall under the definition of a violation. It seems like the court is likely to side with the Shelleys, though, if we wish, we could put our weight behind Kraemer's argument."

This has been seen as a huge victory for the African-American cause for racial equality between the citizens of the Union, and has been celebrated by many of the progressive voices, and equally decried by Dixiecrats, who see the ruling as the Supreme Court's continued \"Upholding of Judeo-Masonic satanist values\"."

Filed in support of a prospective candidate to the University of Texas School of Law, Heman Marion Sweatt, \"Sweatt v. Painter\" alleges that the University of Texas prevented the admission of Sweatt solely on the basis of race. The President of the University, Theophilus Painter, is recorded as saying that his credentials were \"adequate\" for admission, but due to the policies of the State of Texas on integrated admission he could not be admitted.\n\nIn the Texan State Supreme Court, following an intense legal battle with the Attorney General, the courts ruled in favor of the University of Texas by saying that Texas A&M planned to provide education to African-Americans at a future time. The prosecution claims that this does not fully cover the requirement to have equal access to education, while the defense claims that while the situation is unfortunate, a plan for equal education is in place, covering the non-discrimination clause.

Although not seen very favorably by many white students and even lecturer's who believe it to be in their words \"distracting and putting student's with lesser folk\", these bigoted remarks have not stopped the spirit of learning that many disenfranchised freshmen had been yearning for years to finally be protected by the law."

tex.2006.d: "Following many arguments from across the prosecution and the defending University of Texas, the final decision had been asserted; although there were grounds to say that the outright refusal of Sweatt's application was unjustly, it did not actually violate in the courts eyes the 14th amendment, as being a state's matter, which had already been viewed by Texan courts as perfectly sound, as there were other alternative schools were Sweatt would be accepted with his credentials, just not a white's school.\n\nThe ruling has come as not only a reversal of past gains of African-Americans attempting to file for higher education in mixed schooling, but as an affirmation of of Jim Crow laws, with many, including famous American attorney Thurgood Marshall, condemning the ruling as a \"Bigoted decision made without any regards for constitutional procedures and disciplines.\"\n\nWhatever many have already said, it is clear that whites and blacks shall remain separated in the education system."

tex.2007.d: "Following the legal precedent set by Sweatt v. Painter, with the 14th Amendment's clause for equal treatment of citizens, regardless of social status, being extended to not just state courts, but all the way to Federal institutions, yet another case of civil rights tensions over the rejection of Linda Brown into Topeka's elementary schools, due to being regarded as \"white exclusive\" schools.\n\nAlong with a few other black families protesting their own childrens' rejection to privileged schools, the case went to the Federal Courts after Kansas enforced the \"separate but equal\" precedent, and whilst seemingly being the norm for most states to adhere to the doctrine, given the current climate, the winds of change have sweeped the nation, though not at all universally approved, with many arguing a reversal of the precedent as an infringement on state courts and federal overreach."

tex.2008.t: "Segregation in Schools is Outlawed"
tex.2008.d: "With all the arguments being laid before the Supreme court, it has been decided that, under the 14th Amendments clause, it is suggested  that it is up to the Federal government, in the hypothetical case of state governments not enforcing the legal tenor that governs the nation, to set in place measures to guarantee that any citizen, regardless of status, must be assigned the unconditional right to be able to attend their choice of source for education.\n\nWith the ruling being televised to tens of thousands of viewers on both state and non-state sanctioned news outlets, many Americans across the union, regardless of their opinion on the matter, know that their next door neighbour is now firmly protected by the Union in the halls of learning."
tex.2008.a: "Separate but Equal is thoroughly rebutted" 
tex.2009.t: "Supreme Court Upholds 'Separate but Equal'"
tex.2009.d: "With the emanating tension in the Union over potentially an overbearing and overreaching Uncle Sam prying its heads over schools and who gets accepted to such prestigious schools, at least that's what the sentiment was, especially in strong hold dixiecrat states, though this fear has been cast aside, with the confirmation of the Supreme Court Justices' ruling that the Separate but Equal doctrine will be affirmed, as although the way in which the schools had harshly invalidated the entries of black students into their campus', it was still not the Court's say in the matter, as it is purely the educated decision of the board who is qualified for entry, and that the legal precedent that would be set with Federal vindication of these students would be catastrophic to the constitutional values and norms of the Union."

tex.2010.d: "In a significant legal battle that has captured national attention, Browder v. Gayle is underway, challenging the prevailing system of so-called \"racial segregation\". The case, which holds profound implications for civil rights, is being closely watched as it unfolds, with the outcome yet to be determined.\n\nAurelia Browder and her legal team are at the forefront of this case, seeking to dismantle the practice of \"racial segregation\" on public transportation. They argue that separate seating based on skin color infringes upon basic principles of equality and justice. Their efforts reflect the aspirations of many African Americans who have long endured the hardships of segregation.\n\nInside the courtroom, attorneys on both sides present their arguments, engaging in a legal battle that will shape the future of civil rights in the country. The court is tasked with carefully examining the evidence and legal precedents to render a fair and just decision. The ruling will carry significant weight and may impact the trajectory of racial equality in America.\n\nAs the case proceeds, supporters and opponents of desegregation closely follow its developments. Voices on both sides passionately articulate their beliefs, highlighting the potential consequences and implications of the court's decision."

tex.2011.d: "A momentous event has unfolded in the courtroom as the legality of segregated buses was challenged in a landmark case. In a stunning decision, the court ruled that the practice of segregating buses based on race is unconstitutional. This ruling strikes a significant blow to the discriminatory policies that have long plagued society.\n\nThe case, which reverberates with the spirit of equality and justice, has drawn attention from all corners of the country. The plaintiffs, backed by a strong legal team, passionately argued against the practice of segregating buses, highlighting the inherent injustice and violation of basic human rights. Their victory is a testament to the power of perseverance and the fight against discrimination.\n\nThe implications of this ruling reach far beyond the confines of Montgomery. It sets a precedent for future challenges against discriminatory practices and provides hope for those across the nation who strive for equal rights and opportunities. The battle against segregation continues, but this ruling is a milestone."

tex.2012.t: "Buses May Segregate, Court Rules"
tex.2012.d: "In a decision that has sent shockwaves through the nation, the court has ruled that buses may segregate passengers based on race. This ruling has dealt a blow to the fight against discrimination and equality, allowing the continuation of practices that perpetuate racial divisions.\n\nThe case, which had drawn attention from various groups advocating for civil rights, ended in disappointment for those seeking justice and equal treatment. The court's decision has sparked outrage among supporters of desegregation, who see it as a setback in the ongoing struggle for racial equality.\n\nDefenders of the segregated bus system, however, applaud the ruling as a necessary measure to maintain social order and uphold long-standing traditions. They argue that allowing racial segregation on buses preserves the harmony and stability of society."
tex.2012.a: "As the Court should!"
tex.2013.t: "Scott v. NASCAR"
tex.2013.d: "The world of stock-car racing has found itself before the Supreme Court today, after a dispute between the national association for the sport NASCAR and driver Wendell Scott turned into a nationwide phenomenon. Scott, an African-American driver from Virginia who briefly served during the Civil War for a state militia unit before turning to stock car racing, rose through the ranks of the various motorsport associations before winning a feature race in Staunton, Virginia. However, despite his prestige, all NASCAR affiliates to date have refused to issue him a license and many local speedways have followed suit as well due to his race.</br>As a result, Scott sued the association, which was denied on the basis of separate-but-equal policies in the Virginia courts. After a series of appeals, the decision has been placed before the Supreme Court, who is expected to deliberate and make their decision shortly. Many in the South fully expect Scott's appeal to be shot down on the basis of legal segregation according to state law, but progressive organizations riding the tide of civil rights agitation have raised a strong case for the driver. Ultimately, however, the decision is in the hands of the nine justices... and the man behind the curtain."

tex.2013.b: "Rule in Favor of NASCAR"
tex.2014.t: "Motorsport Segregation Outlawed"
tex.2014.d: "After a surprising narrow 5-4 ruling from the Supreme Court today, discrimination in motorsport has been outlawed in its entirety on the basis of separate-but-equal institutions being a practical impossibility and overly punitive towards competitors in the sport. This decision, which caught many familiar with a series of similar appeals failing to find purchase in the courts by surprise, opens the door for a bevy of similar attempts in other sports and even other sectors across the Union State.</br>Naturally, the South is outraged at such a decision, and many prominent figures have vowed to boycott any competition involving integrated racing circuits in order to punish the national association. However, as with all things in the Union State, the Court's decision is seen as an indication of movements within the party's core and America First Party branches have officially commended it as a step forward for the nation as a whole. Whether this line sticks for long remains to be seen, but for now the Progressives have won a serious victory."
tex.2014.a: "Interesting..."
tex.2015.t: "Motorsport deemed Integrated"
tex.2015.d: "Following the ruling in Scott v. NASCAR, motorsport institutions across the Union State were forced to integrate or face increasing penalties from the courts and government. While a number of Southern institutions resisted this mandate, eventually they were forced to relent or dissolve themselves from government pressure. Now, after years of this work, the courts have issued a ruling that the sport has reached a sufficient level of integration to be deemed complete. Segregation and tacit denial of service have been largely eliminated, even if private prejudice continues to a more limited extent. This is a victory both for the previously discriminated-against members of the industry as well as the nation as a whole, as old prejudices are put aside in the new America."

He has immense popularity among the America First Party, though new members and those at the fringes have begun to sour to the \"Long Dynasty.\"\n\nLong's Stances:\n\nReconstruction: In addition to completing Huey Long's Share Our Wealth reforms, Earl also promises to expand the public works programs as an economic stimulant, using government funds to kickstart the economy.\n\nCivil Rights: Earl wishes to push broad-base social reforms, including education reform and increasing minority voting rights. However, he will likely take a cautious approach to the arising Civil Rights Movement, not wishing to alienate his power base.\n\nSyndicalism: Earl Long is likely to take a hardline approach to defeating Syndicalism, by reaffirming the movement's illegality, supplementing the police forces in crisis areas with military forces, and approving the use of the Union State's aerial might to flush out Syndicalist remnants in the Appalchians."

A staunch conservative who wishes for a return to 'normalcy', Holt represents the rising voice of exasperation with orthodox Longism on the economic and political right.\n\nHolt's Stances:\n\nReconstruction: The Conservative Faction of 1948 looks to reverse the Share Our Wealth programs instituted by the Long brothers in exchange for more fiscally conservative programs, looking to have a resurgent business system fill the gaps. Holt in particular wishes to privatize the most egregious 'sinks' of money, seeking to give Americans a postwar boom through business and not spending.\n\nCivil Rights: Holt is likely push for an expansion of states rights and to look to counter the rising Civil Rights Movement as a threat to his goals of prosperity. He is not likely to be sympathetic to all but the most token reform, and his faction is even more opposed.\n\nSyndicalism: While taking a tough stance on Syndicalism, the Conservative Faction's response is actually less severe than the Orthodox Faction's response. Holt will reaffirm Syndicalism's illegality but push for an expansion to the FBI and limited strikes on his home region of the Appalachians, looking instead to try to resolve the matter by winning over the public of the region and solving the economic crisis."

He now seeks to spread his ideas across the Union, acting as the figurehead for the Progressive movement in the America First Party.\n\nMcMath's Stances:\n\nReconstruction: The Progressive Faction looks to expand the Share Our Wealth program even further, incorporating some of the ideas Sid McMath introduced into his home state of Arkansas on a platform of national recovery and reform.\n\nCivil Rights: The Progressive Faction wishes to support the Civil Rights Movement and its organizations, looking to greatly reform the Union State's system for broader social equity. However, they worry about going so far as to give into the most radical of demands, worried about potentially causing a figurative revolt from reactionary politicians.\n\nSyndicalism: The Progressive faction argues that De-Syndicalisation efforts should be taken to gradually end plots and revolts, opposing military action in favor of de-escalation and compromise where possible.

tex.elections.12.d: "Russell Long is a figure of both popularity and wariness across the Union State, whose supporters and skeptics alike acknowledge. Unlike Earl Long, whose sympathies towards civil rights activist are known, Russell has taken a more non-committal stance on the matter of segregation, indicating that he would be open to allowing it to remain in place - a stance deeply unpopular among activists and northerners, but appealing to southern constituencies.\n\nHowever, a notable portion of his support comes from his championing of economic policies unashamedly derived from Huey Long's Share the Wealth programs. Russell has insisted that such programs are the best way to continue the enduring legacy of his father, which is easily his most popular position.\n\nHis support gained from his popular economic policies is tempered by his stances on social issues, which may make the difference for some people in the election booth. Russell Long appears to believe that his economic platform will be enough to overcome the concerns of the northern constituencies - time will soon tell if this is correct."

tex.elections.13.d: "One would be hard-pressed to find a single more controversial figure than Strom Thurmond, the Governor of South Carolina. Thurmond has quickly become the face of the pro-segregationist movement, a passionate advocate for state's rights, and the clear favorite of the hard right of the political spectrum.\n\nA pariah in the north of the Union State, but highly popular throughout the south, the divide in Thurmond's support could not be clearer. Thurmond has been against any federal efforts to address segregation, unless it is to officially let the states address it. His focus on segregation and preservation of Jim Crow laws has become a lightning rod that he's used to gain notoriety throughout the Union State.\n\nHe has advocated for enshrining constitutional protections for segregation, allowing states to continue it without fear of federal interference - much to the outrage of civil rights advocates and northern citizens. Yet despite his controversy, he has been able to gain a base of support, which has the potential to grow"

tex.elections.14.d: "Ellis Arnall stands as the Progressive Caucus' main candidate for the 1952 Election. Having served as the State Attorney for the State of Georgia as well as some additional experience at the state level, he started to become quite the household name for many progressives. His success at the state level with his  push of progressive agenda points and mediating the concerns of the rest of the AFP has made him an example of cooperation for many.\n\nArnall is a staunch proponent of the inclusion and further development of civil rights for the minorities of the nation, exemplified by his nearly unanimous support from his state's African American population. His push for the equal rights of all in the Union while viewed negatively by many of his southern compatriots, has made him the darling of the Progressive Caucus and minorities across the nation. He has also pushed for many of these policies in his time working in the State of Georgia, with his biggest promise being to integrate party primaries to include black party members.\n\nEllis Arnall also wishes to expand the Share the Wealth programs and begin policies of soft nationalization with a slow push towards expanding the Share the Wealth to new heights, and a heavy investment into the industries of the nation. Along with this are promises to expand the minimum wage, HBCU grants, and rid the nation of poll taxes, among many more lofty and large-scale promises towards the disenfranchised of the nation."

tex.elections.100.d2: "Recently Presidential Candidate Russell Long spoke in his homestate of Louisiana about the upcomming election and the Orthodox platform. He, much like his father and uncle, stressed the importance of continuing the Share the Wealth programme.\n\nWhile speaking on the late Rush Holt, he wished to stress the importance of getting rid of his successor, Strom Thurmond. He claims behind doors meetings has been held that would ruin the country, like Hoover did more than a decade ago."

tex.elections.102.d: "Presidential hopeful Sid McMath recently held an active rally for his brand of America First politics in Little Rock, capital of his home state of Arkansas. During his speech, McMath criticized what he saw as the ‘old dogs' of the Southern aristocracy and the party machines as stifling any kind of national progress after weaseling their way into positions of power during the war. His promises of postwar reconstruction, welfare development, and a curtailing of the power of the governors and regional party bosses has thus far proven popular among ethnic minorities and various working class groups, though many have also derided him as either a crypto-syndicalist or simply their stooge. Both viewpoints were represented in the crowd and their supporters engaged in a brief but notable scuffle, with McMath's state troopers eventually separating the crowd to allow him to continue."

tex.elections.103.d: "With the announced candidacy of McMath, there has become staunch Opposition from the Conservatives of the AFP towards Sid McMath's policies, particularly with the issue of race, and the expansion of Share the Wealth programs, both very contentious points on the right of the AFP. Holt has accused Mcmath of disguised syndicalist views, seeing him as leading America down the path of syndicalism, racial equality, and government tyranny agaisnt the working man. While much of this is clearly exaggerated and outright false, the rhetoric has resonated with many of the more racially motivated white voters of the Union."

tex.elections.103.b: "He's right!"

tex.elections.104.t: "McMath open to coalition"
tex.elections.104.d: "As Mcmath continues across the campaign trail, he has stopped in his home state of Arkansas, espousing some very idealistic views on what will come in his Presidency. He not only reinforced some of his original statements but has been extremely adamant about setting up the groundwork for a more cooperative relationship between the Orthodox and Progressive wings of the AFP. He cites the similar wishes to expand the legacy of the late Huey Long, and make the Union truly a place where every man is a king. While a decent number of Orthodox-aligned party members support it, the more racially moderate and conservative are hesitant about this prospect. Mcmath, despite the AFP being a single party, has called this \"Coalition\" one of the only ways that America can properly move forward, and bring peace, prosperity, and equality to the people."

tex.elections.105.d: "The Holt campaign came hot out the gates this morning, brandishing a new poll on the primaries. According to the paper, Holt is the most popular candidate in the Union according to voters. While much of the AFP Conservatives and their supporters have used this poll to try and build momentum for their cause across the nation, it has been easily shown that the poll was heavily influenced to be in favor of a positive opinion for Senator Holt. Not only that, the report comes out of his home state of west virginia, and a town with a notably high amount of support for him. While Senator Holts Campaign insists that this report, while representing only one town, also represents the feelings of Americans everywhere despite some sources even suggestion that bribery was involved in the poll "

In his tenure as President, his capability and capacity as a leader has started to come into question and the public awareness around his worsening mental state has gradually become more apparent along with the seemingly stagnating reconstruction efforts. The stress that comes with the Presidential chair has caused a significant increase in the veracity of already present issues, as well as a believed decrease in his capacity to continue his current term of office. the increasing influence of the Progressive and Conservative caucus within the Unions affairs."

Shockingly, when pressed as to the rumors, she reaffirmed her belief that her husband had 'done enough for the country' and that it may be best for him to resign for his health.

During his speech, he emphasized his belief in the power of the individual states to decide their own policies that work for them. Many of his opponents are calling him out for Criticism and hypocrisy as just after that, he made statements regarding segregation becoming part of the Union State constitution to protect the American way of life, met with thunderous applause from many of his key supporters. The speech turned quickly when a man in the audience laid out accusations towards Mr. Thurmond over a possible love child with a black maid in his past, for which he and his team quickly denied and refuted the claims as slander. Mr Thurmond ended the speech proclaiming that he would do what he could in order to protect the Union and the American way of life, no matter what slander comes his way. "

His message appears to have been well-received by his intended audience, though the presence of a group assembled by the rival Talmadge Machine in the state put a damper on the affair by inciting sufficient disruption to call the event off early. Even still, reporting seems to have swung his way, especially in the so-called 'black press'."

tex.elections.111.t: "Earl Long remains unpopular" 
tex.elections.111.d: "While Earl has managed to stay at the helm of the Union, he has been unable to shake his middling popularity issues even after multiple presidential victories. During the 1948 election, he managed to poll his popularity at just below 50%, this number has remained consistent if not stagnant much to the disappointment of him and his campaign. Despite managing to hold on and continue positive reconstruction policies and pass legislation he has failed to win over the hearts and minds of the American people despite his progress. Earl's advisors, administrators, and party members have tried different ways to build up his appeal, with none really managing to stick. This has led to yet another period of skepticism over Earl's chances of winning the next election, and even some of his core supporters have privately discussed his prospects of winning in a cynical light. Earl is adamant that the poll is skewed to disparage his image, but little evidence exists for these doubts to have a foundation other than somewhat fudged numbers from Earls team of campaigners. For many, it's clear Earl will have to fight yet another uphill battle to keep the presidency."

Holt's stances and actions on many issues, particularly concerning the social issues of the day, have proven to be a burden in the north.\n\nHolt's support for the status-quo of segregation, his purposeful distance from civil rights, and his rhetoric on states rights echoing Strom Thurmond has turned off many of the more liberal northerners, who see the status quo as unacceptable or outdated.\n\nWhile most will concede that Holt isn't as problematic as someone like Thurmond, it is unlikely that, barring a complete turnaround, Holt will be able to grow his support in the north."
tex.elections.112.a: "He should have expected this."
tex.elections.112.b: "Well, complain more, will you?"

tex.elections.113.t: "The South critical to McMath's Actions"
tex.elections.113.d: "During the McMath Presidency, many of the more hardline southern legislatures and politicians have grown increasingly hostile towards his progressive agenda. Many claims that his utter disregard for their \"Culture and the rights of states on matters of race\" has caused unrest, attempted usurpation, and destruction of the Southern way of life. McMath has stated that his policies are not to destroy the South but to make it better. Many politicians have come together to express their disapproval and have made public statements with varying support from their populace and state legislatures all over the South. This united front against McMath by his opponents came as quite a surprise to the campaign, having believed that many of their initiatives were done in a way that would keep many southern governors compliant. Unfortunately, this has been proven false. This has also planted the seeds of doubt among some of McMaths more moderate supporters, with some believing that this shows McMath's inability to keep the nation united under his vision for a new America."
tex.elections.113.a: "How unexpected..."
tex.elections.113.b: "Shrug it off, they are just jealous."

tex.elections.114.t: "A Nation Divided?"
tex.elections.114.d: "Division within the AFP has been reflected in the wider Union State, and recognized as an ever-growing issue, one that has now come out to the forefront as the divide between north and south grows more prominent. While the north continues to view a positive view of Sid McMath, his reputation in the south has only continued to plummet.\n\nAs a public show of their disapproval, some within the south have begun to display signs, flags, and paraphernalia that harkens back to, or is even directly from the Confederacy. It isn't uncommon for conversations around McMath to be negative, unflatteringly comparing him Lincoln or Grant - a northerner wanting to impose himself over their way of life.\n\nThis has naturally resulted in anger from McMath supporters who are incised at the comparisons, but most see these sentiments as the latest incarnation of this issue, one that seems only likely to worsen unless something can mend it is likely only a sentiment that will grow unless something can mend the ever-widening divide within the Union State."
tex.elections.114.a: "This is slander!"

tex.elections.115.t: "The South Praises Holt's Actions"
tex.elections.115.d: "Rush Holt has received a swell of praise across the southern states for his recent activities and long-held political stances. Southern officials stated that Holt's actions are critical to restoring normalcy to the Union State, and preserving the American way of life.\n\nHolt's positions on states rights and segregation - while not to the extremes of Thurmond - are broadly acceptable across the south, who dislike the prominence of the social issues that have come to dominate the Union State.\n\nHolt has welcomed the support, embracing southern voters and officials enthusiastically, especially considering the reaction from the northern states which were less-than-accommodating. It is likely that as long as Holt can keep the south on his side, he'll have a firm base of support."
tex.elections.115.a: "Of course they support a segregationist."
tex.elections.115.b: "Now that's a man who has our interest in mind!"

tex.elections.116.t: "McMath remains popular among black voters" 
tex.elections.116.d: "During the election cycle, a new poll shows that a large majority of black voters have decided to put their support behind Mcmath yet again. This development is not surprising to many as it had been made apparent during the last election. The Black population's support towards McMath stands unwavering in the face of segregationist rhetoric from many in the AFP, seeing Mcmath as the path to them getting equality in the nation. Many black activist groups and figures of importance have also started to throw more of their support behind the Mcmath administration, especially in the face of the Conservative and Orthodox camps being much more conservative in comparison. While there are some holdouts against Mcmath in some hardline factions, and others more supportive of the Orthodox methods of civil rights, there is no doubt that Mcmath will manage to keep the Black vote behind him in the election yet again. "
tex.elections.116.a: "Not fully unexpected."
tex.elections.116.b: "I welcome this."

tex.elections.117.t: "Is Arnall a Syndicalist?"
tex.elections.117.d: "Ellis Arnall has come under close scrutiny today as his opponents have come out with what they call \"excruciatingly provable evidence of syndicalist tendencies.\" Many in the Conservative caucus of the AFP have accused the man from Georgia of being a little too cozy with syndicalist ideas such as racial equality and nationalization. These accusations have been readily met by Arnall and his campaign team that his policies are in no way syndicalist, but the spirit of America in its purest form. He rebutted the doubters of his campaign. \"We have heard enough about being practical, efficient, and prudent. We heard it preached through several decades that these things would save the world. I think that, with the salty taste of blood and sweat on our lips, we are learning that we had the best talk once again about doing what is right.\" While most of his supporters have readily defended his positions, it is apparent his cavalier attitude towards equality made some of the racial moderates in his camp somewhat uncomfortable. Many have found his statement to be quite evocative and positive for his campaign among his base, but it has also proven divisive to those on the fence. While he may have strengthened his base with his statements, he has undoubtedly pushed away the moderates on racial issues, whether it is a positive outcome remains to be seen for this up and coming progressive."
tex.elections.117.a: "What a firebrand!"
tex.elections.117.b: "That's just what a revolutionary would say!"

tex.elections.118.t: "Is Thurmond a German Spy?"
tex.elections.118.d: "Several salacious rumors have begun circulating around Strom Thurmond as his profile continues to rise - particularly on his rumored interests or loyalty to foreign powers. Some stories claim that Thurmond has held meeting with German officials, and is 'Berlin's favorite' - fueling fears of German influence in the Union State.\n\nThurmond has denied and harshly condemned these rumors, stating that his only allegiance is to the Union State and the American way of life. While he supports a close relationship with Germany, he stated that he would never allow Germany to dictate American policy. Germany has also denied the rumors.\n\nNo matter the truth, few appear convinced one way or another by the response. While Thurmond's many opponents may be inclined to believe these rumors, and are not convinced by his denials, those who support him have only hardened in their support for him."
tex.elections.118.a: "Does Germany even like him in the first place?"

tex.elections.119.t: "Russell Speaks Out"
tex.elections.119.d: "Russell Long made a surprise public speech, one that follows a widening partisan division within the AFP, and the Union State at large. He directly addressed the growing issue of factionalism in his speech, stating that it only weakened the party, would be something that Huey Long would have despised, and only served the Union State's rivals and enemies.\n\nHe targeted both the right and left wings within the party in his speech, insisting that the solution to these disagreements wasn't to split from the party and ignore the concerns of their fellow countrymen - but to engage in dialogue and respect the alternative viewpoints of others - no matter how they may vehemently disagree.\n\nIt was a strong condemnation of the growing divide that caught some party members off guard, but others have quickly praised, saying that Russell Long is telling some hard, but necessary truths. If this is enough to mend the divides is unlikely, but Russell's profile has assuredly been increased as a result of the speech."
tex.elections.119.a: "Did he actually say where he stands on the issues?"

tex.elections.120.t: "Russell: Like Earl or Huey?"
tex.elections.120.d: "With the rise of Russell Long within the AFP, there has emerged a different number of opinions on Russell, and who he actually is. While Russell has attempted to make a broad appeal to the party, using his family name and charisma to gain support, questions are being asked on what a potential Russell presidency may look like.\n\nSome think he will be little more than a continuation of the status quo of Earl Long, and simply keep the ship going forward. Something they acknowledge people may be fine with, but unappealing to those who want real change. However, those warming to Russell believe that he isn't a continuation of Earl, but a successor who can bring the needed jolt to the AFP that Huey once did.\n\nAs Russell's profile continues to increase, and more people start seriously considering him for candidacy, it will rest with Russell to prove his supporters and skeptics right or wrong, and how he chooses to define himself - be it a continuation of the old, or the start of something new."
tex.elections.120.a: "At least he can give a good speech."


tex.elections.200.t: "AFP Convention - Long Speaks"
tex.elections.200.d: "The arrival of the President to the stage as he addressed the AFP Convention and the Union State at large was met with loud applause, as the party and nation gathered to hear what he had to say. Earl Long opened his speech by highlighting what would become the cornerstone of it - unity.\n\nHe spoke of how much had been accomplished because of the work and vision of the people within the AFP, and the progress they had made in rebuilding the country following the war. He invoked Huey's name several times to applause, promising that there was a new and bright future in sight, but that to reach it they would need to work together.\n\nIt was a speech that most of those watching could relate to, though some critics said that little of substance had been said, instead seeming like Uncle Earl was more concerned about keeping dissenting voices quiet than offering solutions."
tex.elections.200.a: "God bless the President."

tex.elections.201.t: "AFP Convention - Holt Speaks"
tex.elections.201.d: "Rush Holt's speech was widely anticipated, as both supporters and skeptics were interested in how he would present himself to the Union State. A few minutes into the speech, and it became clear that Holt was going taking a safer route, one more palatable for a wider electorate.\n\nHolt's speech often returned to the foundational value of America - hard work, God, and the American Dream. He gave praise to the entrepreneurs and businessmen who had built America, as well as made a point to condemn Syndicalism, stressing that such a dangerous ideology needed to be opposed no matter where it was found.\n\nHe also spent some time speaking on the need to maintain foreign partnerships, but under a policy that proudly placed America first - a statement that received sustained applause. Holt's supporters were very pleased with the speech, and even opponents found little objectionable. It will soon be known if it was enough to sway the public in Holt's direction."

tex.elections.201.b: "God bless the Senator."

tex.elections.202.t: "AFP Convention - McMath Speaks"
tex.elections.202.d: "One speech that received heightened attention, both positive and negative, was from Sid McMath. Allies and rivals alike watched in anticipation to see how the rising figure and unorthodox candidate would address the nation.\n\nMcMath's speech hit on his priorities - first a need for reconciliation, internally within the AFP, the Union State itself, and ultimately the United States of America. He highlighted the need for a proper reconstruction, emphasizing that the state should use its wealth and resources to rebuild from the war, and leave no one behind.\n\nFinally, he spent time highlighting the necessity of progress - stressing the need to create an America that was for all of its citizens, not just some of them. Throughout the speech he quoted Huey Long, stating that the vision he proposed was one Huey would have supported. While he sidestepped some thorny topics, it appears that his supporters were pleased - though it is unlikely to sway those already opposed to him."

tex.elections.203.t: "AFP Convention - The Unity Pledge" 
tex.elections.203.d: "\"In the Aftermath of the Second Civil War, the nation has been left in Tatters. Anglo, Yankees, and their puppets clutch the remains of the nation like vultures pick apart a carcass. The Union however is far from the corpse the world believes it to be. While we have much work to do, the future is bright!\" The end of Earl's opening speech towards the party was met with resounding applause and looks of disgust by many.\n\nDespite the AFP being a Single party, there has been much infighting between the many different factions, and it hasn't been a secret either. Many in and out of the party have seen just how much the AFP has begun to squabble ever since the death of Huey. It has become even more apparent with the Revolt by Pelley, and the attempted seizure of the state by the War Powers Committee behind closed doors. With these events in mind, the members of the AFP have pledged to keep the Unity of both the nation and the party together, and that no matter who wins, they will back the winning candidate. Despite that, they each wish to unite the nation in their own unique ways. The Orthodox have pushed for the nation to be united by the Share the Wealth and the ideals of Huey, of balance, and of stability for the nation in order to save America. The Conservatives have preached for a Unity through American ideals of Capital, Christ, and segregation through the nation, America saved through American values. Lastly, the Progressives, like their namesake, have pushed for America to be united under the banner of progress. They push for America to be united in the name of equality for all no matter who and no matter what.\n\nThe party came together to decide how the new America would present itself to the people and the world, ultimately they decided on..."

tex.elections.204.t: "AFP Convention - The Civil Rights issue" 
tex.elections.204.d: "Civil rights is by far one of the largest debates in the nation right now. All across the Union racial tensions have remained high, and with our nation starting to find better footing, many are wondering what exactly the nature of the new America will be. With much of the South holding vast influence over the politics of the nation, there are some observers at home and abroad that expect much of the same in the regions, that being segregation and Jim Crow to remain the order of the days ahead.\n\nThe Conservative wing of the AFP has seemed most adamant to keep the African American population segregated, with many even playing with the idea of \"Permanent Segregation\" in line with the ideas of \"The New South\", which espouses that the nation must uphold the supremacy of the White population over the Black population to maintain the values of the country properly. Some of the rhetoric has gone much further, with many moderates worried about Segregation becoming permanent if the states are left to determine their own affairs on the issue.\n\nThe Progressives of the AFP on the opposite end of the spectrum, have been the biggest advocate for the African American population in the Union. Consistently and adamantly, they speak of disassembling the current structure against minorities within The Union. Many of the initiatives they have started to push for have angered many pro-segregationists and even a large number of racial moderates that these plans are far too much.They wish to push for more federal Intervention on the issue \n\nLastly, The Orthodox wing finds itself as usual, as the Status quo between the two. While many accept both sides of the argument, many remain racial moderates, either understanding that great change so soon will cause unnecessary destabilization, and others believing that the current system needs to improve upon itself but at a steady and stable pace. While some are much more sympathetic toward segregationist policies, Earl has had to walk the tightrope for years. While Earl himself has sympathies for improving civil rights, much of his base has been vocally opposed, leading him to a very cautious but somewhat progressive approach. Despite that, he believes his stance is the only way for true and stable progress to be made for the nation.\n\nWith everything in the air for the party to decide, they decided that..."

tex.elections.205.t: "AFP Convention - The Reconstruction issue" 
tex.elections.205.d: "Reconstruction has been a slow and tedious process, with some parts of the nation still living in the same conditions they found themselves in at the war's end. In many towns across America, food, jobs, and other necessities remain hard to come by. Much of American industry has not yet had the chance to roar back to life, with the twisted Iron and broken concrete marking much of the landscape.\n\nThe Conservatives have argued for some time now that many of Long's policies, while well-meaning in intention, simply do not work anymore. They stand with the idea that large-scale privatization of America, somewhat similar to before the war, will help rebuild America's middle class. However much of it seems to be encouraged by larger corporations in the background of the Conservative's message, leading to worries from many Progressive and Orthodox members of the party that a reversal of Huey Long's policies may continue on a hard line back to America before the War. Conservative elements have argued that these policies have since served their purpose, and are no longer necessary and will hinder America if they were to continue.\n\nThe Orthodox camp has argued that the construction process, while slow, will lead to much better results than the methods proposed by the Progressives and the Conservatives of the Party. The adherence to the original plans set out by Huey is to be expanded to a more sustainable and planned outcome while balancing the needs of the populace and private interests. They have pushed for an expansion of Social Security in the nation along with an emphasis on land development for the people.\n\nThe Progressives have argued for the nationalization of industry and a large-scale expansion of many of the Share the Wealth programs that have already been implemented under Earl's purview to a vast degree, with nationalization policies and government grants being expanded to heights unprecedented. They also emphasized a large-scale focus on controlling corporations in the Union that they found to be out of control and built a Union in the name of Progressivism. They have also tied many of their hopes towards expanding infrastructure in a similar manner to the Orthodox. The key difference between them however is in scale, with the progressives proposing using the office of the president like a cudgel towards inequality in the nation.They have proposed a much larger expansion of the programs and no definitive, if any end to them in order to build a more progressive union.\n\nWith each faction's policies being out in the open for the party to decide, they ultimately decided in favor of..."

Where there is debate is how the followers of Syndicalism - many of whom are not devotees - should be treated.\n\nMany in the AFP believe that these ex-syndicalists and sympathizers were fundamentally good, but misled people, and that they should be given the chance to be brought back into the fold after an appropriate probationary period and after trials ensured they took part in no particularly heinous crimes.\n\nOthers take a firmer stance on these individuals, with one camp believing these people should face consequences, and be deprived of some rights, like voting, but should otherwise be integrated if they pose no threat. The other camp only seeks the harshest sentences for those who took up the flag of the torch and hammer. With a heavy divide, the vote was soon held, and the convention voted to..."

While there was universal agreement that the United States must be unified under the AFP - there was significant division on how to actually achieve this.\n\nA middle ground was proposed where the AFP would adopt the platform of simply supporting reunification, while leaving the actual details to the next administration. Another of the main factions insisted that the only path to reunification was through a continuation of the war - and to pretend otherwise was delusional.\n\nA different faction opposed this, stating that the AFP should first pursue a peaceful reunification - and only if peace failed, then war would be considered.

Still, the West Virginian senator promised to bring steady refrain to the country and his rise to power has been met with all the same fanfare as his predecessors. He gave a speech from the Capitol, promising to overturn emergency wartime measures and return the Union to a state of respectable normalcy. He made special mention to his newborn son, Rush Holt Jr., whom he swore would be raised an America that was better than the one he was born in. His claims included protecting America's youth from syndicalist overreach and liberal corruption. He was supported on stage by the many backers of AFP's conservative caucus including business leaders like Henry Ford II, and now Vice President James Strom Thurmond.

Sid, as he is known by the American public, is the youngest person ever to hold the office of American president and his youth brings a fitting level of progressive optimism to the Union. The former Arkansas governor's rise to the office of President has been met with steep opposition due to his cavalier endorsement of desegregation and tacit desire to expand the Share Our Wealth programs. But his honorable service as a regular in the Union Army during and after the Civil War have earned him a right to his platform. His inaugural speech was full of optimistic rhetoric that shaped his desire to expand Share Our Wealth as carrying the torch Huey Long lit over a decade ago. While his reception in the capitol was colder than that of his predecessor, President McMath swore to his supporters and critics alike that he would lead the way to an era of prosperity for the American Union State."

For the first time at a Union inauguration, a significant delegation of northern AFP members have come to show their support for the president who has built a powerful political machine out of the previously dilapidated ex-syndicalist territories. The growth of the AFP-Progressive caucus has enabled President McMath to act much more boldly than his first term. He told the American people that his egalitarian welfare expansion was just the beginning and his inaugural speech was a message of hope and a promise to smash segregation with his power as president.

Outside the venue were the shouts of counterprotestors, who briefly clashed with Thurmond supporters. Many expect that these are the first of many such clashes of a presidency that is likely to be an uncertain and tumultuous one."
tex.elections.220.a: "America will never be the same again."

tex.elections.221.t: "President Ellis Arnall Re-Inaugurated"
tex.elections.221.d: "President Arnall has managed to keep the Oval Office from the control of the Orthodox and Conservative wings of the AFP, and continues to make the Union a force of Progress. Despite many of the obstacles standing in his way, President Arnall has managed to keep the faith of the people behind him with his successful policies and leading the charge in the fight to make the Union more Equal for everyone. With his steadfast leadership, the Union's economy and civil rights situation have improved drastically compared to when he originally took office in 1952. While many doubted his abilities, he has proven to the people that he fights to make every man a king from his home in Georgia, to the farthest reaches of the Union. In his address, he promised a continuation of his first-term policies, along with a whole new set of goals. Some of his more lofty goals include expanding the nation's port authorities with generous from the Federal government and implementing a more merit-based system for the nation. Not only that, but he has promised to tackle the nation's Education issues to turn the Union into an intellectual and industrial juggernaut.\n\nWhile many of these goals have been criticized as ambitious or downright unrealistic both at home and abroad, he managed to prove naysayers wrong before, and he is intent to do it once again."
tex.elections.221.a: "God Bless the Union."

tex.elections.222.t: "AFP Convention - Long Speaks"
tex.elections.222.d: "Many were anticipating the speech from Russell Long at the convention, considering it an important step in his candidacy. If there was a moment to distinguish himself, many people expected that it would be in his address. However, those expecting a breakout moment were quickly disappointed.\n\nRussell Long's speech covered the topics that had become typical of him. He stressed the need for a unified party, the need to support the American citizen, and to keep the legacy of Huey Long alive. He sidestepped several contentious topics, particularly concerning civil rights, and only covered the general ideas of his economic policies, leaving supporters disappointed.\n\nWhile many admitted that the speech had been fine, even his supporters were wondering if it would stand out even in a polarized electorate. Russell had clearly decided to play it safe, and no one would know until the votes were cast if this choice would pay off, or prove to be a missed opportunity."
tex.elections.222.a: "He was fine, I guess."

tex.elections.223.t: "AFP Convention - Thurmond Speaks" 
tex.elections.223.d: "Strom Thurmond's arrival to the stage was met with a chorus of cheers and boos - an apt reception reflecting the contention around him. Thurmond's speech was one of the most anticipated - and dreaded - of the convention. However, no one expected Thurmond to be fazed by the reaction of the crowd one way or another.\n\nThurmond, as expected, did not alter his message whatsoever from what people had become accustomed to. He railed against the idea of federally imposed segregation, federal overreach, and repeatedly reiterated that his administration would ensure that the states would have the right to act as they saw fit for their citizens.\n\nHe took some time to lambast his rivals and opponents within the party establishment, civil rights activists who he accused of having suspect sympathies, and the liberals in the party who he accused of wanting to undermine American values. It was not a speech intended to win over any undecided voters, but to reiterate that no matter where he found himself, he would never compromise."
tex.elections.223.a: "Not sure he made many friends."

tex.elections.224.t: "AFP Convention - Arnall Speaks"
tex.elections.224.d: "No matter what one's thoughts were on Ellis Arnall, many people at the convention were anticipating his address to the party. The Georgian came onto the stage to polite applause as he took the podium, and began speaking.\n\nFrom the contents of his speech, one would have expected that he would have come from the north, as many of his policies were strongly reminiscent of a more northern AFP liberal. Instead they came from the mouth of a southerner, who was comfortable using analogies and examples they could relate to.\n\nHe had some notable moments, such as declaring his opposition to segregation, and the need for the Union State to rise above this policy. For better or worse, he didn't obscure his positions, and while it isn't clear how many people he swayed, many of his supporters seemed pleased by his showing."
tex.elections.224.a: "Unexpected, coming from a Southerner."

tex.elections.225.t: "AFP Convention - Finishing Reconstruction"
tex.elections.225.d: "The damage of the Second American Civil War was something that the Union State had been tirelessly working to repair. Huey's economic policies had allowed the state to make progress on the Reconstruction - but now the convention must determine how to finish it.\n\nThere is a strong push from many in the party to not fix what isn't broken. The Share the Wealth policies have served the Union State well, and they see no reason to change them. A different faction has proposed that the policies have served their purpose, and it's time to phase them out, and ease regulations to allow capitalism to more easily flourish. They insist that an empowered collection of entrepreneurs would be able to easily fill in the gaps that the federal government couldn't.\n\nThere is another approach being advocated by a different faction to address some of the emerging issues of the day, particularly rising unemployment. They suggest the nationalization of certain industries will ensure continual employment, and to prevent tyrannical monopolies from forming. Ultimately, the convention voted to..."
tex.elections.225.a: "Share the Wealth works! Let's continue it!"
tex.elections.225.a2: "The Share the Wealth worked! We did it!"
tex.elections.225.b: "Let capitalism finish the job! Open the free market!"
tex.elections.225.c: "Enact nationalization! This will solve unemployment!"

tex.elections.226.t: "AFP Convention - Foreign Relations"
tex.elections.226.d: "Within the convention, the matter of foreign policy was raised - specifically regarding the Union State's relationship with Germany, and the broader Reichspakt. While there has been a steady relationship between both nations, and Germany's support has been welcome, the question now is how the AFP should formalize our foreign policy direction.\n\nA strong segment of the convention wishes to deepen our relationship with Germany, and strengthen the bonds between allies - though stop short of actual membership to preserve our own international autonomy. However, another segment argues that we should go further, and pursue membership in the Reichspakt, as the Union State would almost certainly become one of its most important members.\n\nOpposing both mainstream perspectives is a collection of isolationists making a passionate case that the Union State should not favor Germany or the Reichspakt, and instead pursue a more neutral path. The debates were long and contentious, but in the end, the convention voted to..."
tex.elections.226.a: "Deepen and expand our relationship with Germany."
tex.elections.226.b: "Make it clear that the Union State will one day be part of the Reichspakt."
tex.elections.226.c: "Declare that the Union State will pursue neutrality."

tex.elections.227.t: "AFP Convention - Civil Rights"
tex.elections.227.d: "Perhaps the most contentious topic of the entire convention eventually came to the forefront - that of the question of civil rights. It was a topic where fights have already broken out between segregationists and civil rights activists, and tensions between each side are thick, making discussion difficult to control and moderate.\n\nSo disruptive has this topic been that a growing portion of the convention wants to simply ignore the topic altogether, and have the question of civil rights be answered by the next administration. Another contingent, supported by the segregationists, has proposed just explicitly endorsing the status quo, seeing it as a way to prevent the implementation of laws ending segregation for the near future.\n\nHowever, the anti-segregationists and civil rights activists have continued to make strong and passionate cases for explicitly pursuing the end of segregation, and want the convention to make that position clear. After a short, controlled, and contentious period of debate, the AFP ultimately voted to..."
tex.elections.227.a: "Defer any question on civil rights to the next administration."
tex.elections.227.b: "Denounced segregation, and adopted a pro-integration platform."
tex.elections.227.c: "Endorse the current status quo."

tex.elections.228.t: "AFP Convention - Nuclear America"
tex.elections.228.d: "An emergent issue within the AFP convention is the matter of nuclear weapons - specifically the development of atomic bombs for the purposes of defense. The AFP is very aware that the development of nuclear weaponry, even for self-defense, would be considered extremely provocative and invite condemnation across the world.\n\nAs an idea to mitigate this, some members have proposed that the Union State hold talks with neighbors like Canada to formalize nuclear policy, process and make it clear that atomic weapons would only be used for defense. However, there are many in the AFP who scoff at the idea of asking a foreign power for their opinion, and see nuclear weapons as the only credible deterrent - no matter if the Accord protests or not.\n\nStill, there are others within the party who hate the idea of nuclear weapons at all, and not only think the Union State should not have these, but that they should lead a denuclearization movement worldwide. After significant debate and proposals, the convention voted to..."
tex.elections.228.a: "Develop a defense nuclear doctrine in coordination with neighbors."
tex.elections.228.b: "Spearhead a denuclearization movement!"
tex.elections.228.c: "Pursue the development of atomic weapons."

tex.elections.229.t: "AFP Convention - The Unity Pledge"
tex.elections.229.d: "With the convention soon coming to an end, one of the final items on the agenda was a deceptively simple one - a Unity Pledge, intended to bring the entire America First Party together, which would be underscored by a short phrase capturing the spirit of the American Union State.\n\nBut what phrase best described the Union State? That was something that led to a heated debate, as it turned out to be a contentious topic. Bravery was one such argued virtue, harkening to the original American Revolution, and the repeated bravery shown by Americans throughout history. Others argued that it was freedom, for freedom was the bedrock of American values, as without freedom, what did anything matter?\n\nStill another group argued that progress was the defining characteristic of America. They highlighted the evolution of a small revolution into a major nation. They argued that it was because of America's desire to strive higher, they possessed this spirit that would ensure they would always succeed. Ultimately, the convention decided to go with..."
tex.elections.229.a: "America, the Brave"

tex.elections.229.c: "America, the Progressive"

tex.elections.230.t: "AFP Convention - The Debate"
tex.elections.230.d: "Finally, the day arrived for one event that everyone was looking forward to - the debate between the presidential candidates. The prime time event had watchers from across the Union State - and beyond.\n\nSharing a stage together, each of the candidates were faced with a series of questions, several times directly asked to contrast themselves, and their responses demonstrated how each of the men responded to the pressures of debate. The debate had some heated moments, a few gaffes, and presented each of the candidates in a different light than before.\n\nEach candidate was able to get in some strong statements, though stumbled in other places. In the end, it was difficult to choose an objective winner, as each had made their case to the American public in a way most of their supporters were satisfied by. If nothing else, those who watched were thoroughly entertained by the event."
tex.elections.230.a: "[TEXGetElectionLeader1] is the clear winner"
tex.elections.230.b: "Some excellent points from [TEXGetElectionLeader3]"

tex.elections.400.t: "Earl Long Re-Elected in the American Union State"
tex.elections.400.d: "As elections come to a close in the American Union State, its people have chosen to elect sitting President, Earl Long, who has been in his position since the death of his brother. However, this election proved more contested than prior ones, with the Progressive and Conservative factions presenting a serious challenge in both the North and South. It is predicted that, despite the election results confirming Long as President, both Sid McMath and Rush Holt will protest the results within the America First Party.\n\nIn his inaugural address, President Long reaffirmed his commitment towards post-war recovery and the prioritization of national unity. He also pledged to continue the \"Share the Wealth\" programs begun under his predecessor and expanded during his term, as well as making overtures towards the reform of wartime legislation and even hints at the beginning of debate on the issue of segregation — though experts are skeptical at any serious change from the wartime position of non-intervention."

tex.elections.401.d: "As elections come to a close in the American Union State, its people have chosen to elect Rush Holt as its next President alongside a strong shift in their Congress towards the Conservative faction. As the first member of the Conservative caucus of the AFP in the tumultuous history of the Union State to secure the office of President, Holt has perhaps done what seemed impossible to many: putting the Long Dynasty to rest. However, Holt's victory is not without its opposition, as people are predicted to protest the result.\n\nIn his victory speech, he stressed the importance of American business and the ending of wartime nationalization, while also promoting cooperation between business and the government. During the campaign season, he decried the "wasteful" and "borderline Syndicalist \"Share the Wealth\" projects of his predecessors, while also slamming Progressive attempts at so-called \"desegregation\" as an overreach of federal authority. Many experts expect his administration will see little done in this regard, a position welcomed by the Conservatives."
tex.elections.401.a: "A return to form for American politics."

As the first member of the Progressive caucus of the AFP in the tumultuous history of the Union State to secure the office of President, McMath has perhaps done what seemed impossible to many: putting the Long Dynasty to rest. However, his victory is not without its opposition, as the Conservative faction and Orthodox politicians are predicted to protest the result.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, he stressed the importance that the \"Share the Wealth\" programs must remain, while also be expanded upon to provide greater relief following the war. During campaign season, he decried the Government for not doing enough against the issue of segregation and the maintained limitations of civil rights from during the wartime period, an issue he is expected to attempt to tackle during his term of office despite heavy opposition from within the party itself"

tex.elections.403.t: "Earl Long Re-Elected in the American Union State"
tex.elections.403.d: "The elections of the American Union State have concluded with Earl Long again being elected as president of the Union State. Widely seen as the status quo candidate, Long promised a continuation of his administration's policies, and framed the race as a choice between progress and regression.\n\nIt was a message that appeared to resonate with the electorate, as while there were several credible challengers, it proved insufficient to overcome the entrenched support that 'Uncle Earl' held. Germany has sent their congratulations to the president, and it appears that, for better or worse, the Union State will continue on its current trajectory."

tex.elections.404.d: "The elections in the American Union State have concluded with Rush Holt inaugurated as president of the Union State. Holt throughout his campaign defined himself by his pro-business credentials and capitalist policies, which earned him support from across the business world, whose endorsement was enough to secure the votes necessary for victory.\n\nIt is expected that President Holt will continue to implement his business-friendly agenda, though some fear at the expense of existing social and government programs. There are also expectations that Holt will further isolate the Union State on the world stage, though the consequences of this election will not be felt for some months to come."

While many doubted his abilities to steer the nation towards a much more progressive approach, he has managed to keep the faith of the people with his agenda. With many of his policies having been completed, and much of his agenda points being tackled  during his first term.

tex.elections.406.d: "The Long Dynasty returns to the Union State with Russel Long, son of of the Great Huey Long, having won the race for the President of the American Union State. Having won over the people and the Orthodox Caucus, Russel long has sought to take up the mantle his father and uncle had held into the future as they had done before. Earl occupies a unique area of the Orthodox Caucus when compared to his Uncle. His stances towards race and civil rights are somewhat more conservative than his Uncle, preferring what he calls a more \"pragmatic\" approach towards these issues. While he has made some effort to appeal to progressive movements in the Union, he has far more comfortable towards the status quo than others in the Orthodox and Progressive Caucus. That being said, he is adamant about continuing the implementation and carry through of his father and uncle's ideals of Share the Wealth.It seems that the future will bring a return to form for the Union, with apparently many wishing for a rebrand of Uncle Earl and the Kingfish, and Russel seems to be just the right man to make it happen."

tex.elections.407.d: "Governor Strom Thurmond has today become the nominee for the AFP, and thus President of the American Union State. After an interesting series of debates, campaign events, and many more exciting events, Strom Thurmond now finds himself in the most powerful seat of the nation. The rhetoric from his campaign has yet to stop either, as he seems dead set on making sure that Segregation remains and Jim Crow stays entrenched as both a State and as a national policy. President-Elect Thurmond has also promised extensive reconsolidation and reorientation of specific government programs that critics have said would disproportionally affect African Americans in nearly all matters influenced by the government. He has also pledged to strengthen State's Rights for the nation and generous cuts towards government-favored companies such as Ford. \n\nWhat stands out the most to many foreign observers is his intention to build closer ties to the Pakt. While the American Union State has been an isolationist nation, they have shared ties with the Germans since the end of the Civil War, and seek to expand upon it while keeping America \"True to its values.\" Come what may, Strom Thurmond will undoubtedly leave his mark on the Union, for better or worse."

tex.elections.408.d: "Defeying expectations across the board, Ellis Arnall has won the Presidential nomination for the AFP as President of the American Union State. President Elect Arnall started the race as the least known candidate nationally at first, with other candidates garnering more attention beforehand.

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nAugust 26th, 1895\nWinnfield, Louisiana, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nAs President of the American Union State, Earl Kemp Long's journey to the top was anything but smooth. As America burned, and political games commenced in New Orleans, President Huey Long appointed his ideologically-parallel younger brother as his Vice President. It was an episode of clear nepotism, but in a time of paranoia Huey had few others he could reliably trust. As Vice President, Earl Long worked diligently to put the Share the Wealth program in place across America, living seemingly permanently in his brother's shadow. He cultivated a reputation as a down-to-earth, relatable politician, helped in part due to the America First Party's enormous propaganda machine, and seemed content to remain close under the Presidents thumb.\n\nBut then everything changed.\n\nWith the mysterious assassination of Huey Long in May 1943, Earl Long was thrust into the spotlight. In a nation coming apart at the seams, Earl was able to navigate the shark tank that is the AFP and unify the Union State once again, before continuing to pursue Huey's eponymous ideas. However, Earl never could step fully into the shoes of his brother. Starting his tenure off with a promising flurry of emergency legislation and a series of impassioned speeches, Earl's presidency has gradually plateaued. Underhanded deals and backroom backstabbers within the AFP have made Earl increasingly apathetic, and a worsening mental state has made him increasingly ineffective. With the weight & stress of tens of millions of Unionists on his shoulders, and with political crows beginning to circle, can the Longist dream of \"Every Man a King\" really flourish into the future?"

###Mountaintop Insurgency###
TEX_mountaintop_insurgency: "The Mountaintop Insurgency"
TEX_mountaintop_insurgency_desc: "Termed by many as the 'Last Front of the Second American Civil War', the §YMountaintop Insurgency§! represents a thorn in the side of the American Union State as it attempts to move into a postwar situation. The §YMountaintop Insurgency§! was initially formed by the remnants of §RCombined Syndicates§! forces gone underground, but later developed into an ongoing insurrection within Union State borders as locals joined the movement and more fanatical veterans of the §RCombined Syndicates§! trickled in. Rather than operating as petty bandits or ineffective guerillas, as most other groups did before eventually being crushed by the various forces of the American Union State, the terrain of Appalachia combined with the lack of infrastructure and popular support in the region created the perfect nucleus for a perpetual insurrection.\n\nAs a result, the Union State now wages a pseudo-war against these guerillas, a last chapter to a conflict declared officially over. West Virginia remains under martial law, with soldiers maintaining order in those areas under Union State control and any groups (including nominal members of the £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §PProgressive§! faction of the £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gAmerica First Party§!) linked to the £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialist Party§! or §RCombined Syndicates§! being barred from public office. Despite these efforts, the guerillas have yet to be finished off, and as of the beginning of 1948 remain locked in a status quo with the government. However, with the new year and the 1948 election comes even more impetus for a resolution to this conflict, and military action looks even more likely as the frost thaws..."
