SIC_the_national_compromise: "The National Compromise"
SIC_the_national_compromise_desc: "When the Integralist state fell apart in 1941, the subsequent May 13th Coup restored constitutional normalcy and reinvited the Christian Democrats to government. While most supported an union with either the Republic or Sardinia, in the end the Christian Democrats and the Military reached a compromise with the Two-Sicilian Monarchy, allying what remained of the Integralists in order to ensure stability in face of the Socialist invasion and postponing the question of Italian unionism to after the War.\n\nAfter the May 1946 elections, the Christian Democrats failed to achieve the absolute majority needed for sweeping constitutional changes; as such, the Bourbon monarchy brokered a new deal between former Integralists, now organised in the new Common Man's Front, and the Christian Democrats, a deal made easier by the dire need of stability and economic growth in the immediate post-war years.\n\nIt is however clear that this deal isn't made to last. While King Ferdinando III hoped to prolong the National Compromise for as long as humanly possible, many think that it is doomed to finally collapse with the upcoming 1951 elections, in which the Christian Democrats are projected to win the absolute majority of seats the Bourbon Monarchy dreads so much."
SIC_the_national_compromise_tt: "§RThe Two Sicilies will only survive as long as the Christian Democrats cannot command an absolute majority§!"
SIC_christdems_republican_sympathies: "Republican Sympathies in the Christian Democrats"
SIC_christdems_republican_sympathies_desc: "While officially the Christian Democrats only support Italian unionism, abstaining from the question of whether support the House of Savoy or the Republic in Milan, it is clear that the party itself is embroiled in republicanism, with its leader Don Luigi Sturzo being a famously uncompromising republican. As such, despite having de-facto ruled the Two Sicilies since its restoration in 1920, with the exception of the brief Integralist dictatorship, the Christian Democrats cannot be trusted; left to govern alone, they will certainly push to unite with the Republic, as long as their monarchist allies in the Military don't interfere."
SIC_military_monarchist_sympathies: "Monarchist Sympathies in the Army"
SIC_military_monarchist_sympathies_desc: "In spite of any attempt by the Bourbon Monarchy or the Integralists to get rid of such sentiments, the Royal Army of the Two Sicilies remains overwhelmingly monarchist; except, instead of supporting the Southern monarchy and Ferdinando III, they support the Savoyard monarchy in Turin. For now, they have been kept at bay by the National Compromise they helped broker; however, uniting figures like war hero General Messe are always ready to breach the status quo, should the status quo no longer recognise their ultimate goal of restoring the Savoyard monarchy."
SIC_questione_meridionale: "Questione Meridionale"
SIC_questione_meridionale_desc: "Since the Spanish takeover in the 16th century, and according to some even before that, Southern Italy has lagged behind the Northern part of the country, both socially and economically. The so-called 'Questione Meridionale' was left unanswered after the Expedition of the Thousand, in spite of several governments attempting to bring the South into the 19th - and later 20th - century through the first 50 years of Italian unity.\n\nToday more than ever, after the desolation left behind by the Socialist Republic, the South is in deep need of economic and social reforms; reforms no one is willing - or able - to achieve."

krg_sic.14.t: "Elections in Sicily"
krg_sic.14.d: "Today, elections have been held in the Two Sicilies, and the results from the polls seem to indicate another great victory for the local Christian Democrats and their leader Don Luigi Sturzo.\n\nThe prelate has been Prime Minister of the Two Sicilies for almost the whole period since the restoration of their Kingdom, despite being a pan-italianist and having been a vocal critic of the Bourbons and the 'Bourbonists' both before and after the restoration.\n\nIt was due to this that Ferdinando III appointed the Integralists to head the Two Sicilies into forming a true separate national identity after the 1937 elections; however the experiment failed due to the open opposition of the Army, ripe with savoyard sentiments, and of the Christian Democrats themselves, with a partially republican leadership and wholly pan-italianist ideals.\n\nAs the Integralist dictatorship melted in face of the Socialist invasion, Sturzo returned with the support of the Army; to ensure stability, he opted not to immediately abolish the southern monarchy, despite widespread support for such a move within his own party, and instead signed a National Compromise with Ferdinando III, promising to hold the issue of pan-italian unionism until the War had ended and the situation stabilised.\n\nWhile following the end of the war elections had been held in 1946, Ferdinando III chose to play for time, with vague promises of a referendum and trying to keep the National Compromise alive until the situation was more favourable.\n\nHowever, with a second great victory for the Christian Democrats and Sturzo's own patience running thin, it is clear that the National Compromise is collapsing, and the Southern Monarchy would be in all but a favourable position in such a scenario.\n\nMost experts predict that the Two Sicilies might not exist anymore by the end of the year."
