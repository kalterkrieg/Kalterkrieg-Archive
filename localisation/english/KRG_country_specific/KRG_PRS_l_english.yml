### Focus Trees ###

PRS_against_madness: "Standing Against Madness"
PRS_against_madness_desc: "Gorgulov is, and will always be, a danger to himself and to Russia. To think that even Savinkov stooped to such low levels and handpicked this psycopath is mind boggling. No matter, for we shall show the world that this madman is nothing more than a remnannt of a bygone period in Russia."
PRS_denikinsk: "From Denikinsk to Moscow"
PRS_denikinsk_desc: "The town at the banks of the Volga, Denikinsk, shall serve as our temporary capital. As the fighting rages on, perhaps making use of the abandoned equipment left behind by Gorgulov's cronies would be a good idea."
PRS_call_the_reserves: "Call Up The Reserves"
PRS_call_the_reserves_desc: "A rebellion would be impossible to fight with the absence of men on the frontlines. Even though an unpopular measure, conscription must be reinstated if we hope to contests the hordes of brainwashed Savinkovists under the command of Gorgulov"
PRS_labour_in_factories: "Labour In The Factories"
PRS_labour_in_factories_desc: "An industrial workforce is a vital part of winning any conflict. With many factories becoming abandoned after the start of the civil war, Vatutin's inner circle has suggested reopening some military factories to make use of the workers left without a job ince the beggining of this conflict."
PRS_labour_on_battlefield: "Labour On The Battlefield"
PRS_labour_on_battlefield_desc: "With skirmishes becoming a more common occurence, it seems that the frontlines are in more of a need of recruits. Conscription campaigns took place east of Denikinsk today, and while not too fruitful, they will have to do. "
PRS_worker_battalions: "Worker Battalions"
PRS_worker_battalions_desc: "The goal of these bolshevik rabble rousers has always been to achieve their pointless revolution. Having persisted in their goal even after the disasturous defeat at the hands of the White Army, had only gave the SZRS and Savinkov another scapegoat to blame for Russia's downfall. Now, we have given them a chance to take revenge against Savinkov's successor."
PRS_work_for_victory: "Work for Victory!"
PRS_work_for_victory_desc: "Even though many factories have been restarted their operations, some of them have put their productivity into question. If we want a quick victory over the pretender, we must enforce longer work hours."
PRS_Vasilevskys_Orders: "Vasilevsky's Orders"
PRS_Vasilevskys_Orders_desc: ""
PRS_offer_old_positions: "Offer Retired Officers Their Old Positions"
PRS_offer_old_positions_desc: "A large number of competent generals and military officers lie in their homes, waiting until this bloody conflict comes to an end. While some of them are indeed to old to command newly formed batallions, those who have just retired could be called one last time to serve their country, perhaps even for a fair amount of rubles as compensation."
PRS_veteran_training: "Who Better To Train Us Than Our Veterans?"
PRS_veteran_training_desc: "Drill sergeants have been extremely hard to find after the outbreak of this conflict. Luckily for us, many veterans of the First Russian Civil War and the Second Weltkrieg have offered to train our young recruits and prepare them for the dangerous task that lies ahead of them."
PRS_an_end_to_savinkovism: "An End to Savinkovism"
PRS_an_end_to_savinkovism_desc: "Savinkovism has brought nothing but pain to the nation. With millions of men throwing away their lifes into the German machine gun fire, and many more dissapearing after making anti-governmental states, we must finish off this wrethced ideology once and for all."
PRS_propaganda: "Propaganda"
PRS_propaganda_desc: "Being a key element for any victorious nation in a war, propaganda serving as the news source is sure to show our population the crimes and insanity of the so-called "current Vozhd". Half-thruts are a common "mistake" made by Russian governments afterall. "
PRS_secure_bases: "Secure Surrounding Bases"
PRS_secure_bases_desc: "With Denikinsk serving as our provisional capital, the security of the city and its serrounding regions have been put into question. Thus, the regional councils of the Denikinsk, Rostov and Pokrovsk regions have been tasked with constructing defensive structures at the periphery of each raion."
PRS_assign_railway_guards: "Assign Railway Guards"
PRS_assign_railway_guards_desc: "The Trans-Siberian Railway is by far our most valuable asset. Being a tool used by the White Forces during the first Civil War, assigning guards to defend our main supply chain seems like a natural move."
PRS_material_superiority: "Material Superiority"
PRS_material_superiority_desc: "While Gorgulov's cronies have an advantage in the field of manpower, we still control stockpiles of abandoned guns, artillery and anti-tank technology. Shipment of those materiel will take aproximately three weeks before they reach our frontlines."
PRS_supply_chains: "Dedicated Supply Chains"
PRS_supply_chains_desc: ""
PRS_requisition_trucks: "Requisition Trucks"
PRS_requisition_trucks_desc: "Cavarly, since the end of the First Weltkrieg, has become an oudated source of supplying divisions. Trucks are considered their modern counterparts, and they serve their purpose quite effectively. Such things were a luxury to have in the Russian army, and still are today. Luckily, we have managed to scavenge a few dozens of them througout our territory."
PRS_increase_production: "Increase Production"
PRS_increase_production_desc: "In recent reports, it has been stated that many of our workers have been producing materiel at a mediocre pace due to the high demands imposed by the central administrations.\n\n Even though that may be a partial truth, the situation is simply too dire to give show any signs of weakness. The quota will remain unchanged until significant advances have been made on the frontlines."
PRS_the_legitimate_russia: "The Legitimate Russia"
PRS_the_legitimate_russia_desc: "When the White Army defeated the bolsheviks at the end of the first Russian Civil War, the entire nation rejoiced as it escaped from the horrors of socialism. Now, with the ascension of Gorgulov, we must show the world that the spirit of the Russian nation lives on only with us, not those rambling despots."
PRS_something_has_to_give: "Something Has To Give"
PRS_something_has_to_give_desc: "After months of warfare, and the dawn of the new year approaching, our advisors are concerned with about the fact that this war will drag out even more. With the industrial force that Gorgulov possesses, we need to make critical changes if we are to win this bloody struggle."
PRS_commissars_return: "Return Of The Commissars"
PRS_commissars_return_desc: ""
PRS_penal_battalions: "Penal Battalions"
PRS_penal_battalions_desc: "Numerous convicts from prisons have willingly offered their service on the frontlines, only in exchange for their freedom of course. Although these prisoners range from petty shoplifters to serial killers, not making use of this opportunity will without a doubt give Gorgulov an advantage over us."
PRS_amnesty_for_defectors: "Amnesty For Defectors"
PRS_amnesty_for_defectors_desc: "Many of Gorgulov's soldiers are realising that the rule of the "scythian" was a mistake. A portion of them thus began defecting in hordes, and have offered their service to our military. This could be a monumental step in ending this conflict."
PRS_look_the_rural_folk: "Look To The Rural Folk"
PRS_look_the_rural_folk_desc: "-"
PRS_seize_materials: "Seize Materials"
PRS_seize_materials_desc: "-"
PRS_backyard_industry: "Backyard Industry"
PRS_backyard_industry_desc: "-"
PRS_increase_conscription: "Increase Conscription"
PRS_increase_conscription_desc: "The issue of conscription seems to be a neverending one for us, as more and more people are dodging drafts or fleeing the country altogether. We urgently need to enforce the military recruitment campaign either in the countryside or in urban areas."
PRS_rural_conscription: "Focus On Rural Conscription"
PRS_rural_conscription_desc: "Villages all around Russia, specifically those from Siberia, have had their male population drafted ever since the start of the Great Patriotic War. While they have done their duty, a portion of them have dodged their draft by ingenious means. Their turn has finally come to serve their nation, whether they want to or not."
PRS_urban_conscription: "Focus On Urban Conscription"
PRS_urban_conscription_desc: "Many cities in the western part of the European Russian territory, such as Samara and Perm have been experiencing a population surge, with many citizens fleeing the towns under the boot of Gorgulov. Making registered rezidents within these cities join the army will give us much needed manpower, while also giving space to the refugees that are arriving in droves. "
PRS_factory_divisions: "Factory Divisions"
PRS_factory_divisions_desc: ""
PRS_missed_harvest: "What Is One Missed Harvest?"
PRS_missed_harvest_desc: "The situation is worsening every day, as many of our troops have reportedly stopped receiving their promised supply, either because of banditry or an absence of such materials. Therefore, confiscating a portion of our farmer's harvests is needed in order to prevent our troops from starving."
PRS_victory_finally: "Victory Finally!"
