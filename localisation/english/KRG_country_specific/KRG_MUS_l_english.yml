### Events ###

muscat.1.t: "The Imam refuses to allow royal garrisons!"
muscat.1.d: "The Imam of Oman, who is our de-jure vassal and has pledged as his predecessors before him to abide by the decrees of the Sultan, has now grossly overstepped his authority over the inner desert area by refusing our generous offer of placing royal garrisons within his territory in order to curtail violent raiders. This offensive move is sure to anger the Sultan."
muscat.1.a: "Insolent old man!"

muscat.2.t: "The Sultan orders garrisons to enter Oman"
muscat.2.d: "Despite the Imam's refusal, our Sultan has decided that protecting the coastal cities from the tribal raiders of the hinterlands is of utmost necessity. As such, he has ordered his troops to start patrolling the inner desert and arrest or incapacitate all resistance they may encounter- be it from the tribes or even the Imam himself."
muscat.2.a: "We must protect ourselves."
muscat.2.b: "How dare he defy the will of Allah!"

muscat.3.t: "Defections from the Armed Forces"
