### HoS Descriptions ###
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 19, 1891\nLos Angeles, California, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nEarl Warren, for all intents and purposes, is a figurehead for all that the Pacific States stands for: democracy, civilian rule, and the vestiges of the American Dream as it was before the Second American Civil War. Born to an immigrant family in Los Angeles, California, Warren managed to attend the University of California, Berkeley, seeking a degree in trial law. The work he found after schooling would be for the Associated Oil Company, rather than trial law, and it would be this work that turned him towards the kind of progressivism that him and the Progressive Party encapsulate. During his work, he would come to know the sort of corruption and graft big business had come to infect every form of life in San Francisco with, and he would commit his life and career towards combatting this— a career that would bring him to one of two highest offices in what remains of America.\n\nWhen the Second Civil War came to America, Warren was a fairly popular Attorney General, having recieved nominations from the Republican, Democratic, and Progressive parties for that position. His popularity and commitment to anti-crime efforts would bring him into direct contact with Senator (soon-to-be President) Johnson, who would tap him for his cabinet and to lead matters on the West Coast. This position brought him into the national spotlight, tackling crime and anti-government organizations with significant zeal, much to the public's approval. Upon Johnson's retirement, Warren would be endorsed by him to replace him as President of the Pacific States, winning handily and coming to rule the peacetime nation.\n\nWarren's first term as President has seen rebuilding, reconciliation, and the restructuring of Pacific society, in order to bring about the late President Johnson's dream of the 'Pearl of the Pacific'. He has reinstated civilian governments along the Rockies, tackled large corporate interests, and begun large economic projects in order to bring about a return to civilian life. These projects, while decried as overreach by Republicans and Democrats alike, have proven successful in laying the foundations for a postwar boom, provided all goes according to plan. As Warren's administration reaches his last year, it seems as if nothing can keep him and the Progressives out of the spot of leadership— and the Pacific from reaching its destiny as the torchbearer of the American Dream."
#POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGHES_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 24, 1905\nHumble, Texas, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nA multimillionaire, film director, aviation tycoon, buisness leader, Howard Hughes holds these and many more titles. Now, he may add the title of President of the United States as yet accomplishment in his life. The man ran a campaign preaching economic liberalization and an opening of the markets of the United States for foreign investment, and railed against the corrupt oligarchy ruling the traitors beyond the rocky mountains and the arrogance of the man who claims to be king over American citizens in Hawaii. While the fascinating (some would say eccentric) man is clearly quite intelligent, many in the press and in the congress question if a man with a lack of prior service in public office is truely qualified to be President of the United states. Howard Hughes remains characteristically undaunted by these critics, and seeks to mold the United States of America as he sees fit. What his vision for the country will look like, many have guessed in vain."

Brown is emblematic of the current zeitgeist that the £GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §OProgressive Party§! holds in Pacific politics. His early career was largely uneventful as a lawyer and political hopeful for the £GFX_USA_republicans_texticon §IRepublican Party§! in the 1928 elections, a typical member of the up-and-coming class of American politics. However, it would be the Second American Civil War that propelled his career forward, as he would be one of the first to switch his party affiliation to that of the rising £GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §OProgressive Party§! that would sweep Californian politics in 1936. Because of this, and the reshuffling of state officials into the new Pacific States administration, he would eventually be tapped to become a District Attorney and eventual Attorney General of California, making a name for himself by cracking down upon §RSyndicalist§!, §gLongist§!, and §CMacArthurite§!-influenced crime.\n\nIt would be this stint as Attorney General, an office vacated by the later-President Earl Warren, which would propel him with the momentum and support needed to become Governor in 1946 on a £GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §OProgressive§! ticket. While this would be contested by state £GFX_USA_republicans_texticon §IRepublicans§!, he would sweep into office with a healthy majority, granting him the office he holds now. His tenure has mostly seen a focus on political and economic reform, reconstruction, and tackling the early issues of Civil Rights as they begin to crop up internally. However, some close to him believe that he may desire further office, as his ambitions are not yet fully sated and £GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §OProgressive§! party elders eye him as a potential national figure.\n\n§YPat G.

CAL_Warrens_Final_Year: "Warren's Final Year"
CAL_Warrens_Final_Year_desc: "As the year begins, Earl Warren finds himself in the home stretch of his first term. Not only are there a number of issues which still need to be resolved, including pieces of policy from previous legislation to implement, there is also the question of political campaigning. With New Years' celebrations ending, one question remains... what will come out of 1948?"
CAL_Encourage_Refugee_Resettlement: "Encourage Refugee Resettlement"
CAL_Encourage_Refugee_Resettlement_desc: "Despite our best efforts, a large number of refugees still remain languishing in the various camps and housing facilities in the Rocky Mountains. With the right mixture of financial incentives, housing vouchers, and negotiations with local governments deeper inland, we can move these refugees towards safer lands and encourage them to properly reenter our society as productive, secure citizens."
CAL_Finalize_Western_Recovery: "Finalize Western Recovery"
CAL_Finalize_Western_Recovery_desc: "Even with the relative lack of damage done to the West Coast, there are still a number of issues we have yet to fully resolve. A number of factories remain closed, labor unions remain combative, and infrastructure projects remain half-done. No longer! We will press forward initiatives to finalize our recovery programs on the West Coast and create an economic center which can restart the sorts of growth America is known for."
CAL_Conclude_Infrastructure_Initiatives: "Complete Infrastructure Initiatives"
CAL_Conclude_Infrastructure_Initiatives_desc:0 "A core element of our mission in the past year has been the construction of infrastructure in various under-served or overly-needy parts of our country, both to act as a source of employment and an assist to local economies. A significant number of these initiatives have been bogged down in legal or financial issues, though, and a small boost to bring them over the top could be very helpful."
CAL_South_Coulee_Dam: "Construct the Grand Coulee Dam"
CAL_South_Coulee_Dam_desc: "A key highlight of our plans to assist the citizens of the state of Washington, the Grand Coulee Dam will provide both electricity and irrigation water to a large portion of the state, significantly assisting our efforts to turn Washington into an example for the rest of the country in terms of development. Of course, it also won't hurt our political chances there, either."
CAL_Link_The_Rockies: "Link the Rockies"
CAL_Link_The_Rockies_desc: "The Rocky Mountains were never intended to be a border, with many of its roads and rail lines instead intended to travel between the Plains states and the West Coast. However, given our current situation, it is prudent to link them all with one another using new rail and road lines, so that we can easily move resources, people, and troops between them as need be."
CAL_Finance_National_Electrification: "Finance National Electrification"
CAL_Finance_National_Electrification_desc: "An unfinished project of the 1920s and 1930s was the movement to electrify rural and under-served areas, a project which unfortunately found itself stifled by the beginnings of the Second American Civil War. Using reconstruction funds, we will encourage the electrification of those areas under our control marked for these developments, both as a sign of goodwill and to support the development of the rural areas which make up much of our border regions."
CAL_Our_City_On_A_Hill: "Our City on a Hill"
CAL_Our_City_On_A_Hill_desc: "It is unlikely that John Winthrop meant our part of the nation in his now-famous 'City Upon a Hill' sermon, however, we have certainly endeavored to meet that message in spirit. Now, a mere decade removed from the start of a fraternal war, our citizens have full stomachs, their homes have power, and business booms once more. Even if things are far from perfect, and even if our country is divided, we can face the future with more determination than despair once more."
CAL_Prepare_the_Federal_Capital: "Finalize Capital Preparations"
CAL_Prepare_the_Federal_Capital_desc: "Sacramento, the capital of the State of California, has served as our regional capital since the beginning of hostilities during the Second American Civil War. However, with the advent of a permanent peacetime, a number of other states have complained about the centralism that this move creates, with some even declaring that this makes the government tantamount to simply an extention of the State of California. As such, Congress has decided to move our temporary capital to the city of San Francisco, both to emphasize the pan-American nature of our government and to prevent accusations of a permanent stalemate, as having a state capital as our permanent capital could mean that we are renouncing our claims to America. However, before we can properly transition the government, a number of preparations will need to be made."
CAL_Prepare_For_Campaigning: "Prepare for Campaign Season"
CAL_Prepare_For_Campaigning_desc: "With both Presidential candidates selected, the time has come for campaign season to begin. By all accounts, this will be the first competitive campaign season in our government's history, and anything and everything that occurs during it will be historic in some form. Will the Progressives continue to hold on to power in the Pacific States, or will the Republicans finally pull off an upset? Only time will tell."
CAL_Continue_The_Course: "Continue the Course"
CAL_Continue_The_Course_desc: "While a return to competitive democracy is nice, the progress made during the years of Progressive Party and coalition government rule cannot be overturned. President Warren's second term will bring liberty and justice for all, and ensuring that he returns to power with a strong enough Congressional majority to enact the required legislation will be top priority."
CAL_Secure_Heartland_Support: "Secure the Heartland's Support"
CAL_Secure_Heartland_Support_desc: "The West Coast of our Pacific States, with their extremely large population compared to the rest of the country, are the only states that matter. Indeed, even with the math of the Electoral College, we only need to win these states to win the office of the President without much concern. We should focus on securing support here, playing things safe."
CAL_Shore_Up_Warrens_Five: "Shore Up Warren's Five"
CAL_Shore_Up_Warrens_Five_desc: "While the West Coast may have more population, the system we inherited from our previously United States ensures that the Rocky Mountain states still have some bite in their maneuvers, namely in the halls of the Senate. Securing the requisite amount of Senators to pass any legislation we wish is far more important than a Presidential race we are likely to win anyways, and so, working to shore up support in the so-called 'Warren's Five' is a better long-term bet."
CAL_Meet_With_The_Nation: "Meet with the Nation"
CAL_Meet_With_The_Nation_desc: "Having undergone a concerted political effort in a specific region, we should now finish up campaign season with a tour of every major city and meet with prominent members of the Progressive Party at a series of town halls, showing our support both for the system that works and the people at the same time. With this move, we should have our path to government secured for the fourth time in the past two decades."
CAL_A_New_Route: "A New Route"
CAL_A_New_Route_desc: "While the coalition governments were all well and good, what the Pacific States really needs is change. The Republican Party, led by the maverick Howard Hughes, are the best vehicle for this change, rather than the establishment Progressive Party that risks becoming a one-party ruler of our democratic nation. Campaigning for the Republicans and showing the American people a vision of prosperity and progress in a well-reasoned direction will be the true path to success."
CAL_Promote_Change_At_Home: "Promote Change at Home"
CAL_Promote_Change_At_Home_desc: "The heartland of the Pacific States, having spent the better part of a full decade under Progressive rule, knows better than anyone how stagnant it can be. Under the California and Oregon branches of the Republican Party, we've made significant inroads here, and changing the legislatures of these states to promote our message will certainly provide us the best path to victory. After all, with the people comes the win in a democracy, right?"
CAL_Flip_The_East: "Flip the East"
CAL_Flip_The_East_desc: "The eastern, Rocky Mountain states are the most recent additions to our government, and as such are the most politically volatile and least settled state governments in our nation. Despite this, the Progressive Party sees them as settled, and likely will not spend that much time working to win them over. We will show them how wrong this is with a concerted effort there, speaking to disaffected locals and refugees alike. With enough pressure, we can win enough Senators in the East to finally unseat the Progressives there."
CAL_Make_The_Tour: "Make the Tour"
CAL_Make_The_Tour_desc: "Even with our previous engagements, it's likely that the election night will be incredibly tense, with the established Progressives proving difficult to fully unseat. In order to preempt this, Howard Hughes will engage in what he terms a 'media blitz', meeting with Republican groups and cities across the country in a blistering one-week tour, facilitated by his own private airline and personal wealth in order to make one last impression on the people. Hopefully it will be enough, and what we've worked so hard for will come to pass."

#Warren '48#

CAL_Warrens_Second_Term_desc: "As predicted, Earl Warren has won a second term, riding a wave of competence and the legacy of the previous Progressive administrations to victory. Now, the Warren administration looks towards its second term, fulfilling promises and passing legislation to set the stage for a new era ahead."
CAL_The_Fair_Labor_Standards_Act: "The Fair Labor Standards Act"
CAL_The_Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_desc: "One of the first priorities after the debacle that was the past year's Boeing strikes for the Warren government is a new set of union-related legislation, the most important bill of which is the Fair LAbor Standards Act. This bill is intended to create a framework for solving union-related legislation through a National Labor Relations Board, who will include both union and management representation and resolve disputes with the authority of the federal government."
CAL_Electrify_Rural_Regions: "Electrify Rural Regions"
CAL_Electrify_Rural_Regions_desc: "Continuing a promise from the previous term's initiatives, the government will endeavor to expand rural eletricity, reaching every nook and cranny of our country that remains untouched by one of the most important inventions of the modern age. With luck and effort, we will have our entire territory lit for the world to see, acting as both a literal and metaphorical light to those under the yoke of tyranny in the East."
CAL_Fund_Infrastructure_Initiatives: "Fund Infrastructure Expansions"
CAL_Fund_Infrastructure_Initiatives_desc: "With a number of infrastructure initiatives completed in our previous term, the stage is now set for a new slate of projects, ranging from the creation of national parks to regional airports. The government and her wealth and manpower should serve the people, after all, and it doesn't hurt that many of these projects also provide well-paying jobs for citizens... and voters."
CAL_The_Housing_And_Residency_Act: "The Housing and Residency Act"
CAL_The_Housing_And_Residency_Act_desc: "After the Second American Civil War, a large portion of the population became refugees in their own country, displaced by fighting and without homes to call their own. With a concerted blitz of housing construction, we can rectify this issue, providing low-cost housing for our population and helping them to start to repair the lives torn to shreds by the bloody conflict."
CAL_Modernize_the_Agricultural_Sector: "Modernize the Agricultural Sector"
CAL_Modernize_the_Agricultural_Sector_desc: "In order to feed our burdgeoning population, mass agricultural modernization will be required, especially due to the loss of access to the food supplies that the Great Plains used to provide. Fortunately, large sections of the West Coast remain fertile, and with enough investment and mechanization, we should be able to handle any food-related issues that arise from our present situation."
CAL_Enact_Pollution_Limitations: "Enact Pollution Limitations"
CAL_Enact_Pollution_Limitations_desc: "During the war, mass industrial development and relocation was required to provide for the needs of the population and the armed services fighting for our country. However, said industry has come with a large wave of pollution and environmental damage, setting the stage for potential issues in the long term. While we can't ban pollution, we can set the groundwork for developing institutions to govern and regulate what pollution is given out, so we can ensure it stays in acceptable levels."
CAL_Expand_Refugee_Programs: "Expand Refugee Programs"
CAL_Expand_Refugee_Programs_desc: "Now that we have begun to properly resettle and stabilize our refugee populations, the degree of the issue they face has become clear. Refugees need jobs, healthcare, infrastructure, and more, all things we are not presently equipped to give them. By expanding funding in these sectors, we can ensure that the refugee population of our country will see a quicker path to reintegration in society."
CAL_Tackle_War_Profiteering: "Tackle War Profiteering"
CAL_Tackle_War_Profiteering_desc: "Unfortunately, a side effect of such a rapid and widespread war is the proliferation of war profiteering, where private citizens seek to create profits for themselves by massively upcharging for services needed for the war effort or the survival of those caught in the crossfire. By passing legislation to crack down on war profiteers and create safeguards for the future, we can show that we do not tolerate this sort of immoral act."
CAL_Assist_Our_Veterans: "Assist Our Veterans"
CAL_Assist_Our_Veterans_desc: "After the war, we found ourselves faced with a large population of veterans who required medical, housing, and other forms of support that we have not had to give since our first civil war. With emergency legislation, we can finally give them the help that they need, showing that our society does not give up on her defenders."
CAL_Adjust_the_Tax_Code: "Adjust the Tax Code"
CAL_Adjust_the_Tax_Code_desc: "During the war, despite the best intentions of coalition politicians, a number of tax-related policies had to be put on the backburner for the war effort. Now with our position secured, we can adjust the tax code in order to have those in the wealthiest brackets pay their fair share and help the needy in our society to improve their lot in life."
CAL_Toughen_Anti_Trust_Laws: "Toughen Anti-Trust Laws"
CAL_Toughen_Anti_Trust_Laws_desc: "While large corporate firms are necessary for ensuring production, the circumstances of the civil war forced many of our politicians to look the other way as various smaller corporations were bought up by larger, loyal ones. Passing a new wave of anti-trust laws will help to ensure that our economy remains competitive and that we can create a new wave of economic success to act as a model for the rest of Free America."
CAL_Restrict_Lobbying_Activities: "Restrict Lobbying Activities"
CAL_Restrict_Lobbying_Activities_desc: "While lobbying has a time-honored place in our government, the sheer amounts of corruption present in pre-Second American Civil War America and the sorts of graft possible in the government across our border have made it clear that we need to curb our own lobbyists in our government. In order to correct these potential issues, a new wave of legislation will be promoted, including donation caps, funding transperancy requirements, and moral guidelines."
CAL_The_Social_Security_Act: "The Social Security Act"
CAL_The_Social_Security_Act_desc: "While a piece of legislation with a similar title was passed during the Johnson Administration to provide for basic welfare and safety nets during the Civil War, many of its tenets were products of compromise and wartime necessities, and an overhaul is badly needed. The Social Security Amendment Act, a broad-base reformation of the previous act, will provide greater support to Americans on nearly every level but especially those in the lower classes and those more disadvantaged by the circumstances of the war and previous depression. Hopefully, with its passage, we can set the stage for further growth and expansion, all with the knowledge of a safety net being there as needed."

CAL_californian_domination: "Californian Political Dominance"
CAL_californian_domination_desc: "While the Pacific States maintain the systems of old, and these systems have provided stability above most other areas in the old America, they also have issues descending from a very different time— chief among them being the situation of California. No other state can affect Pacific politics as much as that of California, and any politician attempting to affect national politics knows one rule— if it doesn't fly in California, it won't fly in the Pacific. Those outside of California have begun to chafe more and more under this reality, and a change may need to come soon, lest the issues exacerbate..."

CAL_recovering_from_the_ACW: "Recovering From The American Civil War"
CAL_recovering_from_the_ACW_desc: "While our country is not as bad off as the rival government across the Rockies, that is a charitable look at our situation: the reality is worse than anyone would like. The lingering effects of our own abortive revolutions, mass streams of refugees into our territory, and heavy fighting along our border have all created a situation where our City on a Hill is more of a relative one than objective. Solving these issues is a must in order to ensure both our own solvency as well as a greater sense of legitimacy within the entirety of the former America."

CAL_cautious_western_optimism: "Cautious Western Optimism"
CAL_cautious_western_optimism_desc: "With the post-war recovery programs now largely complete, our nation born of tumultuous times and economic despair opens a new chapter in its history. Already new businesses are opening across the country, workers returning to factories long since de-prioritized for war materials, and the flow of trade and money making its way back into small towns everywhere. Many are looking towards the future, though there always remains the nagging sense that things could return to how they were. Time will tell if that feeling proves true..."

CAL_the_american_dream: "The American Dream"
CAL_the_american_dream_desc: "For many, particularly those east of the Rocky Mountains, the once-venerated 'American Dream' is effectively a sick joke. A decade of warfare, destruction, and hardships have caused a significant amount to lose any sort of faith in those systems which held the country together before it all collapsed. However, one cannot say the same about our territory. The Pacific States exists as an independent, democratic, stable, and above all free society, where the tenets of American democracy and idealism have yet to be truly tainted...\n\nAnd many would fight to keep it that way."

CAL_Legacy_Of_The_Federalists: "Legacy of the Federalists"
CAL_Legacy_Of_The_Federalists_desc: "While the so-called 'Federal' government— that of MacArthur's clique— has long-since collapsed and ceased to be effective any longer, the people and organizations who supported it has not. Many of those who formed the core of MacArthur's Western Army Group agreed to join the Pacific States in the Cheyenne Ceasefire, including Generals Bradley and Eisenhower— some of MacArthur's most important senior officers. The Federalists necessarily have a controversial position in our history as a result of this, with some considering them merely misguided patriots, and others traitorous tyrants. Regardless of this, it cannot be argued that their status has given our armed forces a boon, with their expertise and structure giving us an advantage which may be entirely necessary if our long border were to turn hot again.\n\nWe can only hope they do little more than that..."

CAL_Emerging_Civil_Rights_1: "Emerging Civil Rights"
CAL_Emerging_Civil_Rights_1_desc: "Civil Rights, as an issue of political importance, is one few would like to mention beyond general platitudes and the occasional denouncement of Union State atrocities. While there are a large number of African-American refugees in our territory having fled oppression across the Rockies, not to mention those Asian-American and Latino communities who have been here since before the Second Civil War, little has been of significant issue as of now. As these groups grow and organize, however, especially around veteran groups and urban movements, they may become a more important movement in future."

CAL_Emerging_Civil_Rights_2: "Beginnings of Civil Rights"
CAL_Emerging_Civil_Rights_2_desc: "With the victory gained in the case of Perez v. Sharp, the Civil Rights Movement in the Pacific States— while it would still be hard to call it a proper movement, with organizers and leaders— has seen significant traction. Disaffected groups, hopeful with the results of the striking down of Californian anti-miscegenation legislation, have begun to organize on the local level and even discuss more overarching structures by which to tackle the specter of segregation. Even still, the issue remains relatively minor, as the horrors of the aftermath of the Second American Civil War take priority in the minds of most."

CAL_Atlantic_Proposal_idea_1: "Development of the Atlantic Doctrine"
CAL_Atlantic_Proposal_idea_1_desc: "Despite worries over the long-term position we find ourselves in and the necessity of our defenses, the Pacific Joint Chiefs have agreed on one thing: that the reclamation of the United States is our ultimate goal and plans should be developed around this. Internally termed the 'Atlantic Doctrine', this requires offensives to rapidly retake land in the Midwest in coordination with our allies in the East to topple the American Union State. While this plan is ambitious and popular, particularly among those who fought on the Rocky Mountain Front and former members of Federalist units, it will require significant work to place it within the realm of possibility. As of now, this work has only begun, and benefits from the plan are minimal as officers are reassigned and development bureaus re-tasked to achieve this goal."

CAL_Electoral_Explanation_desc: "A key component of the belief system of the Pacific States is the importance of the electoral process— a process inherited from the pre-Second American Civil War United States. Elections fall into two broad categories: §CPresidential Elections§! and §GMidterm Elections§!. §CPresidential Elections§!, as indicated from their name, occur when the President of the Pacific States is elected. These elections are landmark occasions, in which the politics of the Pacific States can be shifted greatly. However, §GMidterm Elections§! are still vital to the course of democracy, as Congressional makeup can be shifted either in support or against the incumbent President, and is largely considered to be a "referendum" on the success of that President.\n\nAs in the former United States, the Congress of the Pacific States has two houses- the §LHouse of Representatives§! and the §gSenate§!. The §LHouse of Representatives§! seats members proportionally to the population of the various states, and has an election every two years, coinciding with both Presidential and Midterm elections. The §gSenate§! seats members equally among the states, two per state, and is split into three classes. One of these classes of Senators are elected every two years for a six-year term, allowing the system to rotate new groups of senators while still maintaining the viability of lengthy terms.\n\n§PGubernatorial Elections§! occur at various rates depending on state-level laws, however, they all take place during either §CPresidential Election§! or §GMidterm Election§! years. While Governors are not federal-level politicians, they still hold immense sway in the political sphere of the Pacific States, as they can often affect state-level party politics and shift political opinion on a national level due to state-level actions."

krg_cal_electoral_results.1.t: "Earl Warren Re-Elected in the Pacific States"
krg_cal_electoral_results.1.d: "In a move that surprised few in the realm of political punditry, the Pacific States of America has reaffirmed its sitting President, Earl Warren, alongside the Progressive Party which has held the coveted Presidency since the beginning of the Second American Civil War. However, this election proved more difficult than prior ones, with the unorthodox Republican challenger of Howard Hughes providing a far closer election than the previous one in 1944. Some believed that there may even be an upset, but election night results proved that the Progressives are still popular with the majority of those in the Pacific States.\n\nIn his inaugural address, President Warren reaffirmed his party's commitment to the people as well as the ideals of American democracy, vowing to continue the broadly popular Public Works program as well as reform the economic system of the Pacific States to better serve the needs of the people. He also hinted at more favorable talks with the Accord, a move welcomed in Ottawa and Boston and scorned in New Orleans."

The first non-Progressive candidate in the history of the Pacific States to win the office of the Presidency, Hughes could largely be considered something of a 'dark horse' candidate, who before 1947 showed little interest in political matters. However, his meteoric rise seems to have done the impossible, and now the longstanding Progressive hegemony over Pacific politics seems to have waned, even if it is not fully at an end.\n\nHughes, in his inaugural address, stressed the importance of American business and liberty, and promoted cooperation between business and the government in order to improve the welfare of Pacific society. During campaign season, he decried the "wasteful" and "politically-motivated" Public Works projects of his predecessor, and many expect those to end in favor of expanding business ventures both at home and abroad."

krg_cal_electoral_results.3.t: "Adlai Stevenson II Elected in the Pacific States"
krg_cal_electoral_results.3.d1: "The Progressive cause seems to have breathed new life today with the election of Adlai Stevenson II to the highest office in the Pacific States, having ran against and beaten the incumbent Howard Hughes. Stevenson, originally born in California but raised in Illinois, made his name as a diplomat to the Accord and a representative of refugees within the Pacific States from Longist-occupied territory. His campaign came on the heel of a number of scandals from inside the Hughes Presidency, scandals which came to sink the Hughes re-election bid and propel this longtime favorite of the Progressive movement into the Presidential seat.\n\nAt his inauguration, Stevenson promoted national unity, alongside a need to put the divisive past of the Hughes administration behind the country and to move forward into a bright and prominent future. He commended the projects of past Progressive administrations and vowed to continue them in spirit, as well as encourage a new era of peaceable relations with the Pacific States' neighbors."
krg_cal_electoral_results.3.d2: "The Progressives once more seem to have won the national referendum on the future of politics in the Pacific States with the affirmation of Earl Warren's successor, Adlai Stevenson II, to the office of the Presidency. Stevenson's campaign was marked by a focus on the positive impacts of Progressive administration, particularly in urban working-class communities, as well as a need for 'steady leadership' in times of crisis. The race was predicted to be close, especially with the strength of the opposition Republican candidate George Marshall's campaign, but it seems that once more the Progressives find themselves in power.\n\nAt his inauguration, Stevenson promoted a commitment to national unity, as well as a desire to reinvigorate the nation and engage in a new wave of Progressive reforms to aid the country, particularly resettled refugees and underserviced communities. He commended the projects of past Progressive administrations and vowed to continue them in spirit, as well as encourage a new era of peaceable relations with the Pacific States' neighbors."

krg_cal_electoral_results.4.t: "George Marshall Elected in the Pacific States"
krg_cal_electoral_results.4.d1: "Following a nearly unprecedented national race, George Marshall has formally been elected as the new President of the Pacific States, and with him comes the first Republican administration in the history of the Pacific States. Running on a platform of national recognition as the man who 'saved the Pacific States' during the Second American Civil War as well as his credibility as a political moderate, Marshall was swept in to office with significant popularity, not least of which stemmed from the desire from the Pacific populace to see change after nearly 16 years of Progressive administrations.\n\nMarshall, during his inauguration, made calls for national unity in the face of increasing international incidents and pressures. He also made clear his commitment to continuing those policies of his predecessors which benefitted the Pacific peoples, while also ensuring their defense from the Longist forces along the Rocky Mountain border."
krg_cal_electoral_results.4.d2: "In the first national election since the landmark inauguration of Howard Hughes, the Pacific peoples have made their voices heard— and despite the issues that a term of Republican administration faced, they have once more elected a Republican for office. This time, it is the broadly popular George Marshall, having run on a platform of national unity and recognition for his services during the Second American Civil War. Despite a strong challenger in Adlai Stevenson, he has managed to win national office, keeping the Republican Party (despite its divisive reputation under Hughes) in the national spotlight.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Marshall made clear his commitment to national unity and moderation in political measures, an implicit break from the policies of his predecessor. He commended previous administrations for their beneficial actions, while also stating a desire to lead the Pacific States into a new era, one defined by strong and decisive action from its highest office."

krg_cal_electoral_results.5.d: "It seems that the Pacific States do not tire of progress, with Adlai Stevenson II once more returning to the office of the Presidency. Despite sharp criticism over both his foreign and domestic policy by warhawks and conservatives, the American people seem to not mind his blend of domestic progressivism and international moderation, particularly if the recent election is to be any indication. His Republican challenger, Douglas McKay, was considered broadly to be a stronger conservative than either of the previous Republican candidates. However, this seems to have backfired on the Republican campaign, as strong opposition to the welfare and social policies of Stevenson proved unpopular in many areas of the country.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Stevenson vowed to continue fighting for the American people, both those who have always resided in the Pacific States and those who have been driven from their homes. With his re-election, Adlai Stevenson has bolstered the new wave of Progressives in the Pacific States, hopeful that a new and brighter future is possible despite the despair of two decades ago."

krg_cal_electoral_results.6.d: "Following the expected announcement that George Marshall would not run for a second term, many experts believed that no Republican candidate would be able to fill his shoes, and that the next President would be almost guaranteed to be a Progressive. These experts would be proven wrong with the success of Thomas Kuchel: previously a moderate figure in the California Republican Party, Kuchel was selected for his neutrality in intra-party politics as well as his working relationship with leading Progressives to spearhead Marshall's domestic policy as his Vice President, a job which eventually allowed him to seek and win the office of President of the Pacific States.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Kuchel stressed his commitment to bipartisan agreements and continuing the policies of his predecessor both at home and abroad, arguing that the time for national unity was stronger than ever. He advocated for the expansion of Pacific States infrastructure, coordination on modernization programs, and more, promoting a line of domestic improvement in the wake of previous administration successes."

krg_cal_electoral_results.7.d: "Following a contentious race against the incumbent President George Marshall, it seems the Progressives have once more returned to their longtime seat of power, with their candidate Pat G. Brown taking the highest office in the Pacific States. Brown, the former Governor of California, was well-known for his pro-labor stance and high-profile public works projects in the state, something that Progressive campaigners made certain to remind prospective voters of in the lead-up to election day. Despite predictions of Marshall's re-election coming before campaign season got into swing, it appears that this message stuck, with the Progressives under Brown once more returning to the highest office.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Brown asserted a commitment to 'helping the common man', and made clear his intention to follow a campaign promise of 'responsible liberalism'. Pundits expect Brown to engage in a move to reform the political system in the Pacific States along Californian lines, as well as handle the rising Civil Rights issue."

krg_cal_electoral_results.8.d: "The conservative cause in the Pacific States of America seems to have gained new life as of late, with the success of its champion, William Knowland, in their most recent election. Knowland, known as a prominent member of the California Republican Party following National Guard service and a staunch opponent of the policies of the previous Stevenson Administration, seems to have been able to successfully bring together a broad base of supporters on the right wing of Pacific States politics to challenge the incumbent President and emerge victorious amidst a hard-fought campaign season.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Knowland announced his intentions to uphold the Republican platform of advocating for Pacific business, reducing the power of the executive branch in domestic policy, and expanding the nation's military, a popular sentiment amidst rising tensions. He also announced his intention to expand Pacific State ties with Pacific countries and promoted a strong line against any form of 'despotic aggression' in the Americas as part of his campaign against 'conciliatory acts' towards the Union State and her allies."

Warren’s re-election symbolizes a continuation of the status-quo that was started in 1937 where  the progressives were first voted into power after secession. For nearly two decades, the Progressive Party has dominated pacific politics, and now, Earl Warren continues its legacy with his victory. In his inaugural address, Warren defended the actions of his first term and stressed the importance of his progressive policies and cooperation within Congress to guarantee a prosperous future for the Pacific States of America. Many Republicans who attended the inaugural ceremony felt ignominy due to their failure to break the Progressive grip on Pacific Politics, however, the delegates still stood and cheered for the President, hoping for a cooperative future."

Hughes represents a significant wave of change in Pacific politics as their third president and first one from outside the Progressive Party. In his inaugural address, Hughes stressed the importance of American business and liberty, encouraging cooperation with the government to ensure the prosperity of Pacific society. \n\n As a long-time advisor to the Pacific government, Hughes is no stranger to the system. But many Progressive Party critics attended the ceremony with chagrin as their government will not be in the hands of a business mogul instead of a career politician. Still, Hughes has asserted his position as a benevolent American leader, stating that ‘I want to be remembered for only one thing: my contribution to the United States of America’"

Stevenson was one of the many political refugees from the east during the civil war, and has experienced first hand the struggles of the early days of the refugee crisis. However, Stevenson made a name for himself, serving in the Western Defense Command and the Pacific State Department. In his inaugural address, Stevenson made sure to stress his support for the progressive party platform and his support for reformist and progressive policies regarding primarily civil rights.

The new President Marshall is an extremely popular war hero from the Civil War, who has been regarded as an exceptional general and an exceptional leader during the collapse of America. Marshall’s service during the civil war was only apart of his large popularity. Marshall had been seen as a potential candidate for the Republican Party for quite some time, even challenging Hughes for the nomination in 1948. Marshall, however, has been described to be much more apolitical than many of his other fellow politicians. He is well respected in pacific politics, by both his fellow republicans, the Progressives, and the remaining democrats. Many have called Marshall the Grant of the Pacific, as being elected President after receiving mass popularity due to being an American war hero. In Marshall’s inaugural address, Marshall exclaimed how he wished to transform the Pacific States into a more prosperous democracy, to protect the borders, and to build the Pacific economy and guide it further into the international world. He was met with applause by both Republican and Progressive delegates, as well as the mass crowd that had listened to his speech. Only time will tell if this war hero will be as grandeur as everyone makes him to be."

The Progressive campaign, largely a continuation of the previous twelve years, sought to ride on popular welfare policies and established politics to once more sweep up a victory for it and its favorite son in Earl Warren. Meanwhile, the Republican Party's dark horse candidate of Howard Hughes sought to capitalize on his business acumen and eccentric but well-liked personality in conjunction with increasing dissent with solid Progressive rule to finally pull off an upset. As strong as both parties are, ultimately, only one can win, and as the final word comes from election counters, broadcasters and street criers alike call out..."

The two party candidates have been solidified long in advance via the primary process, and while the formalities have yet to go forward, machinations are already in place. \n\nPresident Warren faces no serious internal challengers going into his second term, with the Progressive high still riding strong, but no longer unassailable. His platform focuses on improved infrastructure, expansion of social programs, modernization of the country, and more broadly popular Progressive policies.\n\nHis contender from the Republicans is an oddity in the Pacific political sphere, the eccentric businessman Howard Hughes. Hughes, a non-contender until a meteoric campaign rise last year, seems to be focused on dismantling the Progressive one-party system, and promoting business ventures both at home and abroad. He also seems to be currying favor with both Republicans and Democrats, with the Democratic Party for the first time not running their own candidate yet, but rather leaning towards backing him.\n\nAs campaign season draws near, the waters grow ever murkier as to the future of these states..."

Coming from the halls of the Grand Old Party, among all of the minor bits of news and factoids sure to fill the fifth pages of politics sections around the country, was the result of the Presidential nomination: the next Republican candidate for the office of President would be businessman and eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes. A candidate few even considered before 1947, his campaign announcement seems to have struck a chord with the Pacific voters, with stalwart Republican candidates falling by the wayside as this unusual campaign struck forth. Some in the more traditional wings of the Republican Party have criticized his hardline stance on business and anti-syndicalist views, but for now, Hughes' movement is moving forward undeterred.

After the official vote, speeches after speeches came to the floor of the packed convention hall, with both a mixture of commitment to the policies which have succeeded so far and a prevention of the Republicans from 'harming our progress forward' at the forefront of Progressive messaging. A notable point occurred when President Warren himself came to the stage, promising a new and bright future for the Pacific States as the inspiration for Americans across the country and a re-established power abroad, fighting to bring back the city on a hill which was tarnished in the Second American Civil War. The hall seemed as excited as ever for this rhetoric, but it is unknown if the Pacific people will share their idealism, especially given the past three elections handily swinging to the same party.

In an unprecedented move reflecting this fact, the Democratic Party has pledged to support the Republican candidate of Howard Hughes for President. This did not come with a total folding to the Republicans, however, as the Democrats still vowed to run on all other ballots, but here too they seem willing to compromise, as they have announced that they will encourage compromise tickets where they appear viable.

krg_cal_politics.5.d: "Morning newspapers across the country carried the same message today, brought to their front pages by frantic telegrams and phone calls from Washington State the day before: Boeing under Strike! As these papers found themselves in the hands of the citizenry, a group descended on Boeing Plant 2, the central manufacturing plant in the Seattle area. Soon enough, the plant was surrounded by a picket line, workers voicing their displeasure and refusing to work in solidarity with strikes throughout the company.\n\nThe source of this strike seems to be a dispute between the Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge No. 751, the representative of the striking workers, and the Boeing Corporation regarding the manufacturing of wartime planes. While the company sought to transition from a wartime production model to a peacetime one, this would cause thousands of workers to lose their jobs and several central plants to either shut down or downscale, something seen as unacceptable to the workers at these plants. Contract negotiations to prevent this began last year, however, they seem to have been unable to reach an agreement, as a strike was finally declared in order to attempt to force the matter.\n\nWhile our government does have powers deriving from wartime legislation in order to deal with this strike, our internal policymakers are divided on how to act. Many do not wish to take sides, allowing Boeing and the strikers to resolve the situation themselves. While this is the easiest path forward, it holds the risk of stalled negotiations. Some see the manufacturing process as too important, and wish to side with Boeing, which may resolve the situation sooner. However, as our base consists partially of union workers and we have been known to be sympathetic to their cause in the past, this could backfire. Lastly, we could side with the workers, trying to force Boeing to compromise. While this also has the potential of resolving the situation quickly, Boeing is one of our largest material manufacturers, and making an enemy of their board could backfire more than a prolonged strike. Whatever we pick, though, we should do it quickly, or risk things spiralling out of control due to indecision."

However, increasingly, this is proving far too difficult to adequately administer. As such, an agreement has been made to move the Federal capital to San Francisco: a major city off the Californian coast, and one that many believe exemplifies the Pacific States' prosperity. However, the matters of moving a capital are not minor, and they must be sorted before a ribbon can properly be cut or a new session takes place."
krg_cal_politics.100.a: "Let's begin."

krg_cal_politics.101.t: "The Supremacy Debate"
krg_cal_politics.101.d: "Key to our concern about moving the capital is that of supremacy, or more accurately, who possesses control of the affairs of San Francisco. Unlike Washington D.C. before the Second American Civil War, San Francisco is already a bustling and large city, and its city government is well-established. Of course, placing them under the control of the federal government akin to the situation of Washington D.C. by making them a federal district would be an easy solution, but many have decried this as limiting the rights of the citizens of San Francisco. An alternative solution has been floated to just make the halls of government and administrative centers technically a federal district, and grant the rest to the city of San Francisco's government. While some of our leadership may chafe at this answer, it is proving the most popular among the citizens of the city, and thus a decision must be made."
krg_cal_politics.101.a: "The entire city will be designated a Federal District."
krg_cal_politics.101.b: "Just the 'Capital Region' will be declared a Federal District."

krg_cal_politics.102.t: "Infrastructure and Residency"
krg_cal_politics.102.d: "Of the next immediate importance to supremacy is the issue of infrastructure, one which plagues nearly every city on this continent, but one which will plague San Francisco even more after we move our capital to there. Administration requires scores of bureaucrats and officials, and they must reside and work within the city, which will cause transportation issues and housing shortages to become the rule of the day. Of course, we could enact a policy for sweeping infrastructure reform, but that would be costly and unpopular among fiscal conservatives. Alternatively, we could do nothing, appeasing several of the loudest voices on the issue but potentially creating problems for ourselves down the line. As a final option, we could seek compromise, expanding infrastructure in key places but avoiding massive structural shifts. This appeases neither of the extreme sides, but may be the best politically viable option."
krg_cal_politics.102.a: "Expand infrastructure heavily in anticipation of growth."
krg_cal_politics.102.b: "Expand existing infrastructure somewhat to prepare for growth."
krg_cal_politics.102.c: "The current infrastructure is completely serviceable."

krg_cal_politics.103.t: "The Security Issue"
krg_cal_politics.103.d: "Lastly on the set of primary issues is that of security, one which many hope will never seriously need to come up but is required at most as a preventative measure. The already existing San Francisco Police Department, or SFPD, can handle most problems which trouble the city in the present day. However, with the burdens of administration comes unique challenges, and some fear the SFPD may not be able to handle these. As a result, a proposal to create a new San Francisco District Police Department to coordinate both city and capital policing has been floated, which seeks to allow increased protection and ability to respond to threats that typical police may not be able to. This will prove politically costly, with a far more typical alternative being simply increasing the SFPD's funding, but it is an option should we choose to pursue it."
krg_cal_politics.103.a: "The existing SFPD will do well enough with some increased funding."
krg_cal_politics.103.b: "Form a new SFDPD to handle District-only matters."

The streets were lined as the President, Governor of California, and Mayor of San Francisco formally opened these buildings, with many citizens cheering this new stage in Pacific governance. The first ever session of Congress in the hall was broadcast on television across the country and around the world, garnering over a million viewers worldwide for this historic occasion."

krg_cal_hughes.1.d: "Worrying rumors have begun to internally circulate after an incident between President Hughes and several members of his Presidential staff yesterday, which is believed to have occurred late last night in the Presidential House's office wing. As far as reports can corroborate, the event fixated on a report that staffers were preparing to give regarding the findings of internal investigations into Longist sympathizers. President Hughes, while reading the report, made increasingly distressing remarks as to how 'shallow' the report was, and the relative lack of focus on Syndicalist agents within the government. While Hughes is known to make animated statements into the findings of these reports and has taken a particularly close note on ongoing investigations, this is the first time that meetings on the subject have resulted in possible verbal abuse. A particularly notable statement was made to one staffer, who had been hired during the previous Warren administration, claiming that she was 'responsible' for this and was secretly in league with Upton Sinclair's Socialist Party. A cursory investigation at his behest quickly found this to be untrue, but the direct nature of the accusations still is believed to be the cause of a rash of recusements from future meetings on this topic.\n\nIn order to prevent harm being done to the Administration and President Hughes, all those involved with the meeting were made to sign affadavits refusing to discuss the contents of meetings with the President, and the staffer in question was moved to another department and given two weeks of paid leave. However, even if this does remain out of the hands of the press, it has fed into a trend within government and Republican Party officials to be concerned as to the President's health, as some present believed him to have been mentally unfit during the events that unfolded. We can only hope that this was a temporary bout of stress-induced hysteria and not part of a larger trend."

krg_cal_diplomacy.1.d: "A series of telegrams have come our way via open diplomatic channels from an unusual source: the government of the Pacific States of America. Apparently, they wish to establish a diplomatic mission in our country for the purposes of allowing open communication between our two countries. They were quick to reassure us that this does not mean recognition of their government, even if they may have ideally wanted that, but rather a way for our two governments to maintain contact if it is necessary in the future and to attempt to promote diplomatic resolutions to conflicts.\n\nMany within our government were immediately outraged at such a proposal, as it can be seen as flying in the face of our present One America Policy and recognition of the government of the American Union State. They contend that such a move would not only make us appear conciliatory on the world stage to a government we do not even recognize exists, but would also potentially alienate us from our largest ally on the continent. However, some members of our foreign ministry were quick to point out that this is not a violation of the One America Policy depending on interpretation, and it may be a good idea to allow limited communication. At the very least, it would allow us to contact them if anything goes wrong on the continent and give us leverage to implant ourselves further in regional politics. Whatever we choose, of course, we must do so with our own interests in mind."

krg_cal_flavor.0.t: "Perez v. Sharp"
krg_cal_flavor.0.d: "Today, in a 4-3 ruling that looks to hold landmark status in the annals of American legal history, the Californian Supreme Court declared that California's anti-miscegenation laws violated the fundamental right of marriage and, and as a result are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The namesake of the case is Andrea Perez, a Mexican-American woman who listed her racial status as white (a common practice among Hispanic Americans in the state) while attempting to marry Sylvester Davis, an African-American man working alongside her in the defense industry during the Second American Civil War. The two of them attempted to be married in the practice of their shared Catholic faith, but when applying for a marriage license, were denied due to an anti-miscegenation provision of the California Penal Code.\n\nThe lead opinion on the case, written by Justice Roger Traynor and joined by Chief Justice Phil Gibson and Justice Jesse Carter, held that the restrictions on their right to marry violate the United States Constitution and its guarantee of equal protection under the law. The Court also voided the staute, holding that the laws were too vague to be enforceable restrictions, and in their text violate said Constitutional guarantees. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Douglas Edmonds held that the statute violated the religious freedoms of the couple, and that doing so would be yet another violation of the United States Constitution.\n\nWith this section of the Code struck down, other advocacy groups in other states are looking to California as precedent, and not simply in the Pacific States. This has been hailed as a victory by groups both inside places which would recognize this ruling and those which would not, and only emboldens further those looking to create a movement to push for the civil rights of downtrodden groups amidst this divided America."

krg_cal_flavor.1.d: "At 3:43 PM, Southern California was rocked by a sensation that hadn't been felt for a long time: that of the earth moving between them, and the ground seemingly shaking everything in sight. Later measurements determined it to be an earthquake registering on the Richter scale at 6.4, a very strong quake with the potential to do serious harm, had it been in a developed area. Thankfully, no fatalities were reported, though there was significant property damage and several were injured as a result of the quake.\n\nResources to deal with the aftermath were lighter than in past years, though, as budgets for this worry had been cut for the more immediate dangers of the Second American Civil War. War work took precedence over nearly all other forms of work, and by the time of the quake, measuring groups were still only at half their normal size. In the aftermath of this, though, the government has announced a resumption of full funding plus additional for monitoring and precautionary equipment, and universities across the state such as the University of California in Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) have rapidly expanded their centers for the study and prevention of further earthquake damage."

krg_cal_flavor.2.d: "Today, at 4:17 PM, the town of Vanport, Oregon was subject to some of the worst flooding that has been seen since before the Second American Civil War. Situated along the Columbia River in reclaimed lowlands, this majority-black segregated housing neighborhood served as housing primarily for refugees and wartime workers in the greater area of Portland. However, now, it seems that this will be an impossibility, as the majority of the town now exists below water. The cause of the flooding seems to have been a burst dike along the Columbia River, likely the result of heavy rains that had been plaguing the area for several days. While most residents were able to reach higher ground up North Denver Avenue following the sounding of air raid sirens, it was too little too late for several residents of the town, with a small number ending up dead because of the small window to evacuate this vulnerable area.\n\nFollowing the immediate aftermath, local emergency responders aided by state and federal response groups and the American Red Cross have begun to manage the wreckage and establish temporary housing. President Warren has flown to the town to offer his condolences and announce formal government assistance in rebuilding, though it is likely the entire town will have to be abandoned given the extent of the flooding."

krg_cal_flavor.3.d: "Televisions across the Pacific States were greeted today with a new channel broadcasting from the valleys of California to the mountainous outposts of Montana, with the 6 AM morning news anchors launching their flagship program off with a set of bulletins for both domestic and international news. Among those talking points were Congressional goings-on, the reconstruction of the United Kingdom, and tension points throughout Eastern Europe as the Reichspakt and Savinkov rattled sabers at one another. Even if the script itself wasn't particularly interesting or noteworthy, the event itself was momentous, as the readers represent the flagship lineup of a new American television broadcasting network: the American Broadcasting Company.\n\nOriginally a spin-off network of the lauded National Broadcasting Corporation, known as the Blue Channel, the circumstances of the Second American Civil War made it such that reporters along the West Coast quickly shifted from sports and local politics and into war reporting. In 1938, the organization (now separated from the main NBC organization due to the situation New York City found itself in) re-branded itself NBC West, and worked to provide news and information on both television and radio to those within the Pacific States. However, wartime circumstances caused non-war news to fall by the wayside, and postwar cuts saw the corporation find itself on difficult times. Now, though, with a fresh name and star-studded lineup, this newly minted news group looks to compete with the re-established NBC and CBS to dominate American programming. Already, lines have been established across the Pacific States, broadcasts via radio waves find themselves crossing the Rocky Mountains, and plans to route connections through Canada to the rest of America are being eagerly discussed."

krg_cal_flavor.4.d: "The Armed Forces of the Pacific States finds itself with a new set of officers and uniformed personnel today as it welcomes the formation of the Women in the Air Force, a successor organization to the Women Air Service Pilots and other smaller organizations of wartime fame. Formed in order to address critical manpower shortages in the early Civil War period at the behest of well-known aviation enthusiast Amelia Earhart, the WASPs became well-known for both their hardworking nature and occasional bouts of fame, with official restrictions on combat roles being flaunted when the situation required it (as supply runs to the Rockies often did). Of the roughly six-hundred female pilots serving in some capacity during wartime following the folding of auxiliary organizations into the WASPs under the broader WAC, roughly two dozen were killed or declared missing-in-action, five of them during emergency combat against American Union State aircraft over the course of the conflict.\n\nNow, with the formation of the United States Pacific Air Force the previous year, a new organization carrying the torch of this tradition under this institution has been formed. Concurrent with its formation is the promotion of Geraldine Pratt May, a veteran pilot and former director of the WAC-WASP Air Transport Corps, to Colonel heading the new organization, the first ever woman to achieve such a rank in the history of not just the Pacific States but the United States. As of now, the WAF is expected to possess as many as a thousand members, mostly wartime veterans, before recruitment is expected to pick up. Civil Rights and feminist activists have hailed this as a step forward, though some worry that in peacetime some of the progress gained may be rolled back in favor of moving most WAF members into auxiliary roles instead."

After years of failure in politics during the early 1900s, Hearst focused on his media tycoon which held ownership of newspapers in almost all major American cities. A staunch isolationist, Randolph Hearst used the strength of his influential empire to help convince the American public of staying out of the first Weltkrieg. In the following years, when the Entente fled Europe, and the Syndicalists took power, Hearst became a capitalist crusader, battling syndicalism at every step, and later denounced Huey Long’s movement as un-American. When the Second American Civil War broke out, Hearst’s newspapers and newsreels became the face of the PSA propaganda. By the later 1940s, his health began to fail and he was moved to Los Angeles to be nearer to his doctors until his death on August 14th, 1951 at age 88."

Francis had denied his involvement and knowledge of such organizations, but many within the committee seem more than willing to prod him and other defendants into disclosing more information that suggested a deeper link to the Longist cause and to the American Union State.

The Court ruled that the law violated the right to freedom of speech conferred in the Pacific States Constitution and the Constitution of California because its restrictions were too broad and vague. \n\nThe case originally involved a public school teacher in Sacramento who refused to sign the required oath. He was fired from his position and he sued the Sacramento County Board of Education. Eventually, the case made it to the 3rd District Court of Appeals. \n\nThis decision no doubt a win for the civil libertarians of the Pacific States.

This report, totaling almost 291 pages long, claimed many colleges, churches, and even some military personnel in the PSA had "wittingly or unwittingly aided and abetted the pro-Longist conspiracy in this country." While the report is composed mainly of allegations, it is serious enough for some of the accused to come in person to San Francisco to testify before the committee and deny these charges, one of them being the president of Brigham Young University, Ernest Wilkinson. Most notably, however, the release of the report has led to one of the first arrests of a military officer for conspiracy against the Pacific States. Lieutenant Commander George L. Rockwell, who had moved from New England to the PSA to become a flight instructor for the Pacific Navy, was arrested at Navy Air Station San Diego by agents of the Western Bureau. While in San Diego, he encountered underground American Vanguard Party cells. Eventually, he became a quiet, albeit regular advocate for Vanguardist and pro-Longist ideology within the military.

Reilly, looking to crack down on \"hedonism and lawlessness\" in the state’s bars, suspended Stoumen’s liquor license indefinitely. Stoumen then challenged this suspension. The Court’s opinion states that the Black Cat merely being a gathering place for a \"certain class of person\" does not implicate the allowance of any illegal or immoral acts on the premises. \n\nExperts say that this case will pave the way for more bars to offer their premises to homosexual patrons. Other commentators have even suggested that this could lead to more legal acceptance of homosexuality in the future.

What had been just a quiet apartment inside the three story complex had housed an illegal underground cell of the America First Party. In a joint operation with the Western Bureau of Investigations, the cell had been monitored for the past three months and both police and federal agents had found evidence of the group smuggling in Pro-Union propaganda and weapons that were to be used in robberies and kidnappings. As the deputy chief cleared more information past the assigned agent from the WBI, he explained there was also sufficient evidence of a plot to assassinate House Representative Charles Norris Poulson, though no further comments could be made regarding the raid as the deputy chief ordered the crowd to return home.

krg_cal_flavor.15.d: "In a heated 4-3 ruling by the California Supreme Court, the previously enacted Levering Act was amended today, invalidating the use of loyalty oaths besides those to the Constitution and the United States for public officials. This ruling stems from the case of Orbe v. Randall, where ACW veteran Guillermo Orbe was refused a tax exemption because he had refused to sign a loyalty oath as required by Californian law. While the ruling was upheld in lower courts, the California Supreme Court reversed the decision, citing that the loyalty oath provision had breached First Amendment rights and thus was unconstitutional. Since then, a stream of court cases regarding loyalty oaths has been deliberated on, most notably on oaths done by public officials. In the end, the Supreme Court had also ruled that these loyalty oaths for public offices, barring those that upheld the Constitution and the Government of the United States, were also unconstitutional. Radical conservatives across California have vocally protested against the ruling, warning of “syndicalist and Longist intrusion into our political system.” However, most political correspondents have agreed with the court’s decision, arguing that Constitutional rights should supersede more authoritarian measures employed by the AUS, ever the boogeyman for PSA politics."

krg_cal_flavor.16.d: "Proposition 14, the California Real Estate Association-sponsored ballot initiative, has passed by referendum on &get.date. As per the text of the bill, property owners and landlords will be given maximum discretionary powers to sell or rent their properties to tenants of their own choosing. This measure limits state power for individuals to make contracts as they choose, and explicitly names the right for any seller or renter to refuse to sell or lease property to another based on race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry. The California Real Estate Association celebrated the measure, stating that \"the rights of property owners and landlords have been protected from their properties being vandalized by tenants of poor moral character and their rights being trod upon by an overzealous governing body increasingly co-opted by special interests.\" Protests in major cities quickly followed, alarmed by \"bigotry being woven into the very fabric of our state Constitution.\" Protests following the measure were peaceful, and were allowed to assemble and dissolve without incident."

In a statement, President &get.name approved of the House's legislation, stating that "renters and home-buyers of California can rejoice in our commitment to their pursuit of the American Dream, a home that they can truly call their own." The California Real Estate Association decried the matter as unconstitutional, citing public policy arguments that a landlord or seller cannot be compelled to make a contract against their wishes. Public rallies both in favor and in opposition to the Fair Housing Act have garnered large crowds, but no incidents of violence were reported and both rallies and protests were peaceful and without incident."

krg_cal_flavor.18.d: "During the evening hours of November 2nd, the San Francisco Police Department began a series of raids on businesses around the city, focusing on a crackdown of so-called “sex deviants” that had suspected ties to underground syndicalist organizations. Despite its taboo nature within Pacific culture, homosexuals enjoy a brief sense of normalcy in underground bars and nightclubs, where they can mingle and enjoy drinks in a space of like minded people. However, many in the police department and the Western Bureau suspect these points to not only be suspected hubs of underground syndicalist organizations, but also possible sources of national security risks. This Lavender Scare, alongside the ever growing Longist Scare, have prompted these raids to be conducted. By dawn, as many as 47 suspected homosexuals have been arrested for indecent conduct and disturbing the peace. While many gay rights organizations are condemning the raids, most notably from the Mattachine Society, these voices have so far been drowned out by the media, who have already drummed up suspicions of these underground hideouts sporting anti-capitalist and extreme political ties with the Mexican government to the south."

The telescope had taken nearly 12 years to build, with construction starting in 1936, but ultimately halted a year later due to the start of the Second American Civil War. George Hale passed away in 1938, and the new telescope was dedicated in his honor at the unveiling alongside a much smaller 48-inch Schmidt telescope. The Hale Telescope, measuring 200 inches in diameter, is the largest in the world.

However, the society has faced scrutiny from many social conservatives from the Republican and Democratic parties, as well as faced backlash by conservative media, not only by the support for gay rights, but for the connection between the society and the syndicalists, which has caused the society to even face hostility from politicians of the Progressive Party.

krg_cal_flavor.24.d: "Following three weeks of unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, the Union of Bay Area Telephone Workers has declared a strike against the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph company this morning. More than 20,000 workers, mostly composed of switchboard operators and maintenance workers, have walked out of their jobs and entered the streets of multiple cities within the Bay Area. While the protests and demonstrations have remained nonviolent, there have been several instances of police arresting workers as they strike in the streets, mainly due to disturbing the peace. Most notable of these comes from Hayward, where Japanese-American maintenance workers face increased scrutiny from police forces in the area. Landline connections around the Bay Area have been severely restricted, with telephone exchanges struggling to connect callers around the Bay Area, much less any incoming or outgoing calls. As the strike began to sink in and landline communications began to grind to a halt, PSA officials called for both parties to resume negotiations. However, the UBATW has been adamant in their demand for an $8 per week wage increase, a stipulation on which PT&T has refused to agree. As strikers and union leaders have begun gearing up for a long strike, company representatives have pressured the Pacific government. Representatives from the company have begun stoking fears of the communication breakdown in the capitol, stating it could become a perfect opportunity for the AUS to strike the PSA with their pants down, a possibility that has begun to worry both the public and media outlets across the Bay Area. The escalating situation has been pushed onto the Pacific government for mediation."

While PT&T representatives have stated their dismay at the new arrangement of the $8 per week wage increase and reduced working hours, they are more than happy to settle things quickly rather than prolong the strike. Major labor unions across the PSA have already congratulated the UBATW on their strike, with PT&T workers returning to work across the Bay Area this morning. Progressive and left-leaning outlets have touted the agreement as another win for worker’s rights, with unions feeling more empowered to bring companies to the negotiation table. Various conservative newspapers expressed disappointment at the results but pointed out that the Pacific government's peaceful strike resolution is commendable. More radical conservative outlets, however, have run articles decrying the negotiations, stating that the PSA had galvanized syndicalist actions by not intervening on the company’s behalf. Whatever the results, the new arrangement has seen workers reaping the benefits of an increased wage. This effect is most apparent for the switchboard operators, which, as a job occupied predominantly by women, has allowed these workers to support themselves and their families further. With switchboards being staffed once more and maintenance workers back on the job, landline communication troubles around the Bay Area have subsided as telephone lines buzz back into action."

While union leaders have expressed their dismay at the settlement, many agree that a partial wage increase is the best offer they will get, considering the strong opposition from PT&T, even with the government’s mediation. Conservative forces and media outlets within the PSA have applauded the government’s intervention as a fast and fair resolution to get employees back to work and claim that the UBATW would have otherwise made ridiculous and borderline syndicalist demands to a pressured corporation. This slightly contrasts the response by more progressive outlets, who stand disappointed over the compromise that favors PT&T rather than the blue-collar workers but commend the peaceful resolution of the strike nonetheless. Most of the backlash for the negotiation comes from other labor unions and left-leaning outlets across the PSA, which have since opposed both the company’s lackluster agreement and the government’s response to workers exercising their right to bargain. This effect is most apparent for the switchboard operators, whose predominantly female employees have expressed displeasure at continuing their pay gap compared to their male counterparts. With switchboards being staffed once more and maintenance workers back on the job, landline communication troubles around the Bay Area have subsided as telephone lines buzz back into action."

Originally brought into the game as a substitute batter, Sheridan replaced Tommy Glaviano after the latter was injured in the 8th inning. The Solons had put a man on second base, but the score remained 2-0 in favor of the Seals. With Sheridan at the plate, San Francisco’s Milo Candini managed to get two strikes on the pinch hitter. It was with the third pitch, however, that the substitute batter connected with the ball. Sheridan hit a long home run toward center field, with the crowd going wild once the ball soared out of the park. \n\nWhile the Solons lost games 3-2, with the Seals managing a run in the 9th inning, the home run had been the show's star. Post-game measurements estimate the home run at 483 feet, which has since become the new record for the stadium and the Pacific League.

While seeming to be a very eventful and lucrative first day to broadcasters, journalists, and newspapers alike, the day had been marred with disgruntlement by the invited guests. Traffic was backed up down Harbor Boulevard, water fountains went dry due to a local plumber’s strike, and many vendors had to close their doors early due to running out of food to sell. Still, many guests have reported that the attractions and sights around the park have been very enjoyable for both kids and their parents, with the King Arthur Carrousel a particular favorite. With the initial hiccups on the first day, Disney and his team have already begun enacting fixes to the initial problems for the true public opening scheduled for tomorrow, with revised layouts and proper ride capacity to better service the large crowds of guests.

This theory is also coupled with the knowledge of storms in the area that could have caused the United Airlines flight to divert their course.

krg_cal_flavor.44.d: "Today marks a historic day in the Oregon legislature as the Public Accommodations Bill, touted as the Oregon Civil Rights Bill, is signed into law by [Oregon Governor], having passed in the senate by a vote of 21-9 and the house by a vote of 46-11. The new law makes it a civil penalty to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, or religion in the use of any facilities and accommodations open to the general public. While the initial bill had tried to make discrimination a criminal offense, compromise with the more conservative members of both legislatures allowed the bill to be passed in the first place rather than being shot down. As historic as the new law may be, it has already seen massive criticism from many hardline conservatives and pro-segregationist groups. One of these groups is the Civil Freedoms Committee, led by Reverend Elbert D. Riddick, rector of the Church of the Good Shepherd in Portland. Riddick has railed against the bill as “unwanted companionship and compulsory equality”, and has already announced his and the organization’s intent to circulate petitions for a state-wide referendum to challenge the new law as a violation of an Oregonian’s freedom of choice. He faces an uphill battle, however, and it seems unlikely that the petition will get anywhere without any support from major political figures in the region."

krg_cal_flavor.45.t: "Mariana UFO Incident"
krg_cal_flavor.45.d: "Residents of Great Falls opened the pages of the local Tribune today to find a startling headline: FILM CAPTURES UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER MONTANA. Local resident Nick Mariana, along with Virginia Raunig, were entering a local baseball field before a game when a bright flash caught Mariana’s eye. He states to the Tribune that he saw “two bright silvery objects” flying over Great Falls at great speed. Mariana ran to his car to grab a movie camera he used for home videos and recorded the flying objects for around sixteen seconds. While the flying objects Mariana describes were odd enough, more perplexing were the two fighter planes pursuing the objects towards Helena and into PSA airspace. The planes, boasting AUS roundels, were reported to have been turned back by PSA interceptors before returning to the nearby air force base outside of Great Falls. No responses have been issued by either governments as to the incident, and the reason for the fighter pursuit and the identification of these UFOs remains unknown. This has led to many in the region starting to speculate on the identity of the silvery objects, which has ranged from weather balloons to prototype aircraft from the neighboring PSA and even some pointing to aliens."

krg_cal_flavor.46.d: "Copper mining in Butte, Montana has seen the light today, quite literally. Several copper mines, now coming under the ownership of the Anaconda Mining Company, have begun the transition from underground mine shafts to open air mining operations in the newly named Berkeley Pit. Touting the change as more economical and safer than underground mining, Anaconda Mining has already reported a significant improvement in the scale and efficiency of ore extraction, with estimates from the company predicting upwards of 17,000 tons of ore per day and more than 6 million tons of ore per year. While copper is the primary material being mined at the Berkeley Pit, other metals such as silver and gold have also been extracted. Slight concerns have been brought up about the groundwater in the area leaking into the pit, Anaconda Mining has assured the public in nearby Butte that water pumps are operating in the former Kelley Mine, allowing for operations to remain unhampered."

krg_cal_flavor.47.t: "\"Uranium Fever\" Hits the Pacific States"
krg_cal_flavor.47.d: "This year, thousands of hopeful prospectors have descended onto the Four Corners to try and stake their claim on both government and private land. Uranium mining, once considered as merely a partner to vanadium mining, has exploded recently in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. Some of the sparks for this uranium craze was both former shepard Paddy Martinez and geologist Charles Steen, the two of them striking it big when they found uranium deposits in New Mexico and Utah respectively. Eager prospectors, ranging from oil workers, farmers, clerks, and even housewives have jumped onto the bandwagon, with some companies producing radiation detection equipment seeing their sales increasing by more than 500%. Moab, Utah and Grants, New Mexico, once nothing but small desert towns, have made their mark on the map by recording that their populations have more than doubled since the uranium rush began, with Moab residents crowning themselves as the \"Uranium Capital of the World.\" This had led to a boost in jobs and business in these areas, but the large influx of fortune seekers also highlighted the necessity for better infrastructure, more housing, and better access to water sources. It remains to be seen if another citizen makes it big in the Four Corners region, however the rush itself has proven to be a boon to local economies. "

krg_cal_flavor.48.t: "Harrison v. Laveen and Trujillo v. Garley"
krg_cal_flavor.48.d: "Today, both the Arizona and New Mexico Supreme Courts ruled in favor of their respective plaintiffs. Frank Harrison and Michael Trujillo, both veterans of the Second American Civil War, brought their cases to the Supreme Courts after suing the county recorders. Before the two cases, Native Americans in Arizona and New Mexico had been disenfranchised by loopholes in the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act. The Arizona Supreme Court had deemed Native Americans as ‘persons under guardianship’, thus making them ineligible to vote, while New Mexico ruled that Native Americans that aren’t taxed were not legally allowed to vote. However, 24 years after both decrees were made, the three judges in both Arizona and New Mexico’s Supreme Courts have overturned their earlier rulings. The new court decisions removed the legal and constitutional barriers that had prevented Native Americans from casting their votes, with the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously deciding that their earlier ruling from 1924 to have no application to the native populations. Although many Native Americans within Arizona and New Mexico are still ineligible due to poll taxes, literacy tests, and language barriers, the rulings mark a step forward for the suffrage of their Native populations."

krg_cal_flavor.50.d: "What had once been nothing more than an abandoned artillery training post for the Pacific States in the Civil War makes history today. The Idaho National Laboratory, built in 1949 on the site of the training post, was opened by the Pacific Energy Commission to further research into nuclear physics and its potential for civilian applications. With a team of Canadian-American nuclear physicists led by Walter Zinn, electrical power has been harnessed for the first time from a nuclear reactor. The reactor, a prototype that had taken the better part of two years designing and constructing, was intended to prove that breeder reactors could produce more nuclear fuel than it consumed. Utilizing uranium fuel rods and cooled with sodium-potassium alloy, the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) was switched on in the morning hours of December 20th. The status of the reactor was anxiously monitored, but the tension dissipated soon after when four 200 watt light bulbs illuminated inside the control room, signaling that the reactor was producing power. As the day went on, technicians noted that EBR-I had produced over 200 kilowatts of electricity, enough to keep the entire laboratory powered on its own. This test alone proves the feasibility of nuclear energy as a peaceful source of energy production, and is hallmarked in the community as the first steps into a so-called \"Atomic Age.\""

krg_cal_nuclear.1.t: "To Create a Star"
krg_cal_nuclear.1.d: "During the 1920s and 1930s, American scientists and physicists were on the forefront of atomic physics research, with figures like Isidor Rabi, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Linus Pauling existing right alongside the intellectual heavyweights of Fermi, Chadwick, and Bohr. However, with the beginning of the Second American Civil War, this research into theoretical applications of nuclear fission and research into atomic particles vanished nearly overnight, as institutions were either shut down or geared towards fighting the brutal and bloody war that tore America apart. When the German nuclear program finally bore fruit in the development of Project Heimdallr and the destruction of Portsmouth, American institutions and projects on similar concepts had laid abandoned for years, and physicists and military figures alike could only watch as this destructive force was unleashed. Many feared that these weapons could find their ways into the hands of forces aligned to Germany like the American Union State or otherwise bring about the end of the world, a prospect most did not exactly find comforting.\n\nHowever, as the years go on and nuclear proliferation increases, there has been an increasing push within academic and military circles for the Pacific States to begin developing her own atomic program. Through seemingly sheer luck, our state both contains the requisite uranium to develop such a bomb in extremely high quantities as well as the institutional talent, with many American physicists like the vaunted Oppenheimer finding themselves working at universities like CalTech in the postwar. Should we so choose, it would not be impossible for us to begin work on our own program, even with our divided and war-ravaged state. Many wonder if this is the right thing to do, though, as nuclear proliferation within the former United States could prolong the stalemate or at worst cause untold levels of destruction, were the weapons to actually be used. While policy debates will likely continue for some time, official classified recommendations either way from the top will be able to sway these arguments, potentially putting us on the path to join the extremely select ranks of those with nuclear capabilities."
