### Ideas ###
PHI_guerilla_war: "Ongoing Anti-Guerilla Campaigns"
PHI_guerilla_war_desc: "The Philippines are blessed with hundreds of square kilometers of jungle and tiny islands that allow those who oppose the government many places to hide. We are constantly having to send troops and police to flush out and fight our enemies be they the Moro, the Hukbalahap or others who simply wish to avoid their obligations to their government. The situation is so dire and there is so much banditry that some parts of our territory are practically no-go zones. Until this matter is resolved, we must focus inward on calming the national situation before we get involved in external matters."
