### Ideas ###

IND_divided_INC: "Polarised Party"
IND_divided_INC_desc: "The Indian National Congress was founded on one principle - Indian independence. With that achieved, it found itself the caretaker of a newly born country, attracting members from all across the political spectrum. Now the INC finds itself split, an umbrella party for socialists, conservatives and others, held together - barely - by the man in charge."
IND_pacified_lahore: "Lahore Pacified"
IND_pacified_lahore_desc: "The lands once occupied by the so-called Lahore Government are now back under Indian control, but the occupation is far from over. The transitory military government in place in those provinces have yet to rid the area of all insurgencies, however growing discontent against martial law may force the government's hand, but which way they will swing is yet to be seen."
IND_disappointing_reunion: "Disappointing Reunion"
IND_disappointing_reunion_desc: "The wars over the last decade were meant to reunify the country once and for all, but the outcomes of the war have been… disappointing to many. The south remains out of our direct control, with Mysore and Travancore under our protection and the so-called Dravida Nadu firmly independent. Many elements in our society see this as our failure, and we must be the ones to fix it."

IND_no_pakistan_cores: "§RThe Union of India does not have cores on former Lahore Government territory.§!"

### News Events ###

krg_ind_news.1.t: "Jawaharlal Nehru Shot"
krg_ind_news.1.d: "In a stunning scene of violence today, an armed man shot at and hit the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. During the attack, the would-be assassin was shot by return fire from his bodyguards and expired at the scene of the attack. Nehru isn't dead yet, but is in a critical condition at the Chittaranjan Hospital in Calcutta. In the meantime, the Syndicate, a cabal of Indian National Congress Party politicians, have informally taken power and are deliberating on a successor in the event that Nehru does not recover.\n\nNehru leaves a young nation led by a party loyal to him and his leadership, and without his presence the INC might be on course for implosion."
krg_ind_news.1.a: "The Father of India is gone, and he leaves tremendous shoes to fill."

krg_ind_news.2.t: "Lal Bahadur Shastri Appointed Prime Minister"
krg_ind_news.2.d: "In an expected turn of events, the Syndicate has appointed the well-known Nehru-loyalist Lal Bahadur Shastri to the vacant post of Prime Minister, following Nehru's recent death. \n\nGenerally considered to be a safe, if uninspired choice, Shastri has the respect of many across the Indian National Congress Party's poltical spectrum, but is markedly less popular than his martyred predecessor, perhaps due to his long tenure as the man in the edge of the picture frame."
krg_ind_news.2.a: "The Congress continues Nehru's Path."

krg_ind_news.3.t: "Morarji Desai Appointed Prime Minister"
krg_ind_news.3.d: "In a surprise twist, the Syndicate has appointed Morarji Desai, the ambitious figurehead of the more conservative wing of the Indian National Congress Party, to the vacant post of Prime Minister, following Nehru's recent death. \n\nCharismatic and divisive, but with a broad popular appeal, Desai represents a hard shift in the direction of the governments' ideology. It is highly unlikely that the leftist elements of the INC will happily follow their new Prime Minister."
krg_ind_news.3.a: "That cant be good for Party Unity!"

krg_ind_news.4.t: "J.P. Narayan Appointed Prime Minister"
krg_ind_news.4.d: "In a surprise twist, the Syndicate has appointed Jayaprakash Narayan, the hero of Free India, leader of the Congress Socialist Party faction of the Indian National Congress Party and self avowed Syndicalist, to the vacant post of Prime Minister, following Nehru's recent death. \n\nPopular with the people, Narayan is highly unlikely to command the same political majority that Nehru did, but perhaps he will not need to."
krg_ind_news.4.a: "Somehow, Syndicalism has Returned."

krg_ind_news.5.t: "India Invades Dravida Nadu"
krg_ind_news.5.d: "The Union of India has invaded the last splinter of disunity on the continent, aside from the German and Portuguese treaty ports. The nationalist Dravida Nadu republic's attempt to provide a legitimate state for the Tamil speaking people will now be put to the test.\n\nWith their overwhelming army, its hard to see the Indians losing, though this is likely to be a bloody conflict."
krg_ind_news.5.a: "One Last War of Unification?"

krg_ind_news.6.t: "War Across Southern India"
krg_ind_news.6.d: "The Union of India has invaded the so-called 'Deccan Alliance', a rather surprising grouping of southern states seeking to maintain their independence from Calcutta. How long this motley crew can holdout remains to be seen, but it does not seem likely they'll be able to repulse the vastly larger Indian Armed Forces."
krg_ind_news.6.a: "One Last War of Unification?"

krg_ind_news.7.t: "India Unified at Last?"
krg_ind_news.7.d: "With the annexation of the final holdout states in the South, the subcontinent has been almost completely unified. That said, troubles in Muslim majority regions continue to simmer, and the Union of India now turns it's eyes onto the treaty ports at Pondicherry and Goa.\n\nThe question of how these final footholds of the imperial powers will be handled, and if the Muslim's will remain quiescent under Hindu majority rule remains an open one."
krg_ind_news.7.a: "Peace in India?"
