 ### IDEAS ###
 ITA_spirit_of_45: "The Spirit of '45"
 ITA_spirit_of_45_desc: "Disunited since the end of the First Great War, Italy was only reunified under a single government with the capitulation of the Socialist Republic in 1945 — and when the so-called Italian Civil War was finally over, it left a country with no more stomach for conflict. Regardless of who they supported, the victorious and the defeated were both completely exhausted by almost three decades of bloodshed and separation. The fury of civil war gave way to \"the spirit of '45\", a pervasive pacifism across Italy that resolutely opposes any foreign adventures. As long as the national mood remains this way, any such projects are simply not possible.\n\nThe Spirit of '45 has one wrinkle: its legacy is that of a people who want no part of war, but are imminently prepared to fight it if required. Every town and village has someone who fought in the Civil War and knows its horrors — people who don't want to keep fighting, but will do so even alongside their former enemies if it means securing a lasting peace. Anyone who brings war to Italy, from within or without, can be sure to find a nation reunited against them."
 ITA_the_restoration: "The Restoration"
 ITA_the_restoration_desc: "On September 15th, 1941, the remaining opponents of the Socialist Republic agreed to restore the Italian monarchy in the hopes of uniting White forces following the collapse of the Integralist dictatorship in the Two Sicilies. Although not a universally popular move, many supporters of the Milan Republic were willing to accept this development in exchange for participation within the consolidated White government, and a pledge to hold free elections after the war. This unified White front has been considered a turning point in the Second Great War, as it helped coordinate actions against the Socialist Republic and prevented the fall of the entire peninsula.\n\nFollowing the end of the Italian Civil War, a referendum confirmed the position of the monarchy in 1946. This immediate post-war period has seen a broad government of the major parties attempt to build a new political consensus around constitutional monarchy. However, as the years of unity government go on, issues both new and old have begun to lay the grounds for division. Some defeated Reds and die-hard supporters of the Milan Republic still see the monarchy as being imposed on them; and even beyond these fringes, new political issues have emerged as the focal points of a recalibrating political landscape.\n\nThe reconstruction of democracy demands that the unity government must one day end — and when it does, that a new system of political alignment take its place. Many look to a brewing conflict between the dominant People's Party and the \"laicist\" political tendencies as the foundation of Italian politics' next great divide."
 ITA_montreal_agreement: "The Montreal Agreement"
 ITA_montreal_agreement_desc: "In order to secure Danubia's acceptance for the unification of White Italian forces, an agreement was reached in Montreal during 1942 in which Vienna acknowledged the consolidated White government and pledged not to occupy any Italian territory after the war. In exchange, Italy would agree to demilitarise Veneto and accept restrictions on its military.\n\nThe Italian public accepted this agreement as a necessary war measure, but the necessity of the Montreal Agreement makes it scarcely less humiliating. Despite the prevailing attitude of pacifism in the public consciousness, Italians continue to resent the symbolic restraint of the country at the hands of a foreign power. For some, the situation brings bad memories of the First Great War and offends their fundamental sense of nationalism. As such, one of Italy's foreign policy aims is to have these restrictions lifted in the near future, if at all possible."
 ITA_collapsed_industry: "Collapsed Economy"
 ITA_collapsed_industry_desc: "The Second World War and the chaotic fall of the Socialist Republic brought death and destruction to our country. This much was already clear when the last offensive began in 1945 and our armies raced through Northern Italy.\n\nHowever, as we liberated the Padan Valley, we found how extensive the damage was. The dockyards of Genoa, some of the most extensive in the Mediterranean, were completely destroyed. So were the industrial bases of Piedmont and Lombardy, torn up by the retreating Socialist forces and deeply disfunctional following years of Totalist mismanagement. Virtually no bridge stood intact, and no railway could be traversed by the Socialist Republic's famed ElettroTreno Rapido that had made the world speed record for trains back in 1939.\n\nWhile a part of our industrial base has been partially restored via private funding of the returned industrialists, a lot remains to do."
 ITA_archaic_administration: "Disjointed Administration"
 ITA_archaic_administration_desc: "When the Monarchy was restored in 1941, it was agreed that the Statuto Albertino would be temporarily used as basic law, allowing Marshal Caviglia's wartime government to wield extensive powers and act resolutely in bringing an end to the conflict.\n\nHowever, when a civilian government was restored right after the liberation of Rome, the state of decay of our administrative machine became apparent. Operating under five different regimes in the interwar years, even the friendly bureaucrats in Veneto and Sicily had different standards and applied different laws, not to mention the Totalist bureaucracy in Tuscany.\n\nWhile the Constituent Assembly continues its works to give a new Constitution for the entire country, the day-to-day governance is severely affected by the state of our local authorities. And not to mention, the Constitution will have to be implemented - which will likely be a long and costly process."

The last phases of the war have been most instructive, with the efficient use of combined arms, the use of nuclear weapons and the Folgore division's mad dash to London at the very end of the conflict providing a wealth of information useful to our general staff.

While they clearly failed in their task in the wake of the Revolution of 1919, it is important to note that most of the government officials of the Socialist Republic had previously been filed in the Central Political Register. Therefore, in order to ensure our hard-earned stability is here to stay, we must allow the Police to begin filing radicals inside the CPC once more."

 krg_ita.11.d: "After a mangled congress hastily organised due to the coming electoral campaign, farmer leader Alessandro Scotti has been elected as leader of the Democratic Socials. Many protested the move, as the rapidity of the entire endeavour impeded proper internal elections, vital to the extremely eterogeneous coalition; some minor member parties even left the Democratic Socials as a whole, and have announced their support of the PPI."
 krg_ita.11.a: "Wait, we can still come back!"
 krg_ita.12.t: "Return of the CSIGB"
 krg_ita.12.d: ""
 krg_ita.12.a: "Long live!"
 krg_ita.13.t: "Dante Veroni Dies"
 krg_ita.13.d: "The honourable Dante Veroni died in his home in Rome earlier today. A lawyer and longtime member of the Radical Party, he stood in their ranks in Parliament between 1913 and 1919; having become associated with Bonomi in the interwar period, he became part of his Milan Government until 1936. National Councillor from 1941, returned to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, Veroni would hold the Justice Ministry between 1947 and 1948. He focused on constitutional matters after the fall of the second Pella government, and advised the creation of a Supreme Constitutional Court. His sudden death at the age of 70 attracted condolences from across the political spectrum, with Bonomi calling him a \"pillar of the new Constitution\"."
 krg_ita.13.a: "Rest in peace."

 krg_ita.53.t: "Formation of the BNLQ"
 krg_ita.53.d: ""
 krg_ita.53.a: "They won't last long..."
 krg_ita.57.d: "Today voters across Italy went to the polls for the first time since 1946. Most political analysts agreed that a PPI majority was certain even before the polls opened; with the socialist bloc discredited, the Populars were left as the only mass party in the country, and had a clear advantage in the new reformed electoral system. The true question was whether this PPI victory would be commanding enough that a government excluding them could be considered impossible to sustain; though Republican Concentration, National Bloc and Democratic Socials campaigned independently of each other, the latter organisation was already sending out feelers for a possible 'government of constitutional opposition', with a wide coalition being formed to oppose the Populars.\n\nIt has now become apparent that such a government would enjoy a parliamentary majority. Still, the wider National Bloc and Republican Concentration don't appear to be ready to support such an executive for now - leading the King to extend an invitation to PPI politician Antonio Segni, who will form a minority 'monocolore' government with external DS support."
 krg_ita.57.a: "One wonders what may come next..."
 krg_ita.58.t: "The 1949 Elections"
 krg_ita.58.d: "Today voters across Italy went to the polls for the first time since 1946. Most political analysts agreed that a PPI majority was certain even before the polls opened; with the socialist bloc discredited, the Populars were left as the only mass party in the country, and had a clear advantage in the new reformed electoral system. The true question was whether this PPI victory would be commanding enough that a government excluding them could be considered impossible to sustain; though Republican Concentration, National Bloc and Democratic Socials campaigned independently of each other, the latter organisation was already sending out feelers for a possible 'government of constitutional opposition', with a wide coalition being formed to oppose the Populars.\n\nAs the results came in, it became clear that such a situation wouldn't come to pass. While it is for now unclear whether the Populars will be able to govern alone, their opposition appears to be too split apart for any real attempt of the Democratic Socials to build their own executive. The Populars appear to be on the road to a full five year term in control of the government."
 krg_ita.58.a: "Well, as expected."
 krg_ita.59.t: "The Democratic Republican Concentration Falls Apart"
 krg_ita.59.d: "The Democratic Republican Concentration had never been a stable alliance, its two main componing parties having different views on various key issues. With their mediocre results in the recent elections, the relations between the two factions broke down; and after a few weeks of failed negotiations, the unified republican bloc is no more."
 krg_ita.59.a: "Surely we can only benefit from this!"
 krg_ita.60.t: "The BNLQ Falls Apart"
 krg_ita.60.d: "After their failure to even come close to obtaining a parliamentary majority in the 1949 elections, the coalition between the various rightist parties parties has fallen apart due to their internal political differences. While some are surprised, few pay the internal squabbles of the two on the right much mind as they've been quite thoroughly sidelined under the current government. While political fortunes are notoriously fickle, few expect that either party will see much success in the near future."
 krg_ita.60.a: "Surely we can only benefit from this!"

 krg_ita.61.d: "The Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari (IACP) was formed in 1903 by future Prime Minister Luigi Luzzatti, to ease the housing crisis in the city of Rome. Its aim was to provide cheap housing for the lower classes of the main italian cities, by building new districts and new towns in the suburban areas.\n\nThe IACP and its sister institutes were nationalised by the Syndicalist government in 1920 and turned into the Socialist Housing Commission; sixteen years later, a decree by Mussolini turned it into the National Popular Housing Union, which was responsible for the heavy urbanisation push of the following years.\n\nAfter the war, the IACP was restored, but the deep economic crisis of the first post-war years kept us from actively investing into an actual popular housing program.\n\nNow, the government has proposed an expansive plan to restore and expand the main popular districts in Turin, Rome and Naples, as well as the incorporation of the State Employees Housing Institute into the IACP."

In the report, the honourable Pier Carlo Restagno has outlined three key issues afflicting the economy. Firstly, are the issues of the devastated infrastructure and industrial base in our holdings on the mainland. Our industrial heartland lies within ruins of Piedmont, this is both our greatest boon and disadvantage. We have a sizable industrial base, but it will require extensive repairs and investment to return to its prewar potential. Secondly, is the ongoing financial crisis resulting from our wartime spending and the ongoing reconstruction efforts in Piedmont.\n\nRestagno has outlined a plan for the formation of two strategic organizations to facilitate the recovery of the economy. The Industrial Reconstruction Institute to manage state finances and our industrial restoration efforts in Piedmont. The railway reconstruction projects are to be overseen by the Sardinian Railway Program. Both projects hold great potential, but the issues of funding are bound to be contentious issues of debate within the Chamber."

In fact, fears are also arising that he may have unofficially consented to the actions of the German-backed anti-leftist paramilitaries during the crisis.  Furthermore, should the opposition decide to investigate Segni's activities further, the resulting political fallout from the possible discovery of the monarchist contingency plan would be catastrophic.\n\nTo prevent the collapse of the government in its infancy, some ministers are threatening to pre-emptively resign from their positions unless Prime Minister Segni resigns from the party. While this measure may seem unusually severe, it may preserve the Christian-Democrats delicate hold over the Chamber of Deputies."

These reforms appear to be inspired by the reforms currently being implemented in the German Empire. To streamline and ease the daily running of the state, Roatta has mandated the formation of the "United National Front". This new united front will be comprised of the existing Roatta Government and the remaining loyal parliamentary parties. Although publicly lauded as the beginning of a return to democratic representation in Parliament, the united front also places the remaining parties firmly under the influence of the Military Government and de facto eliminates what remained of their independence. With stability and security achieved at home, it is now time for Prime Minister Roatta to begin looking at Italian policy abroad."

Much the surprise of the General, who by all accounts flatfooted, even members of his own political bloc seemed to quickly reconcile themselves to the return of the King to public life, although it remains unknown if their disloyal actions were the result of pragmatism, loyalty to the king, a growing reservation at the increasing brutality of Rotta's methods, or having been looped into the Royalist coup from the beginning. Yet one thing remains clear: democracy will be making it's return to Sardinia Piedmont according to both the public statement of King Amedeo himself and his new Prime Minister Antonio Toselli of the CD.\n\nNot all are fully satisfied by this move, with many of the republican opposition (now feeling more safe to make their opposition vocal) claiming this coup was merely a convenient excuse for the monarchy to pin their crimes of the past few years on a third party to save face. Yet most agree that, whatever it's cause, this is a welcome change of events."

 krg_ita_dnf.1.a: "Let's hope they're well intentioned"

 krg_ita_dnf.2.t: "The Robert Affair"
 krg_ita_dnf.2.d: "As the Austrian envoy arrived in Rome, most politicians present at the location expected a cunning and efficient man dressed in a black suit to step out of the train, but the individual that stepped out of railway carriage was none other than Archduke Robert himself. With him, of course, he brought the preliminary proposal of cooperation between the Danubian Federation and Italia. The very first and most controversial point of this draft is the question of our natonal claims upon lands owned by the federal government in Vienna. In return, however, they offer to abolish the most punishing clauses within the Montreal Agreement. While this effectively will nullify all of the influence we may hold on the Balkan peninsula, this may be a necessary step back if we ever wish to see our reconstruction innitiative continue in a smooth manner. Another effect that this proposal had on the Italian parliament is that, for the first time since the Second Risorgimento, most of our government, formed by conservatives, liberals and even leftists, have united in their opposition to this document, citing the national uproar the loss of Trento and Trieste would cause. Regardless of its infamy, prime minister Bella must side either with reason, or the love for his country."
 krg_ita_dnf.2.a: "We can accept this"
 krg_ita_dnf.2.b: "The deal is torpedoed by the nationalists!"

 krg_ita_dnf.3.t: "Italy Accepts our Proposal"
 krg_ita_dnf.3.d: "With the return of Archduke Robert to Vienna, minister-president Wilhelm Miklas was patiently awaiting the response of the Italian prime minister and his foreign minister. After being handed the letter by the nobleman, he began to read the paper that was sent out personally to him. After reading the contents of this diplomatic message two times, the answer to our preliminary proposal was as clear as day: \n\n Italy, the nation that just reclaimed its lands and people from the syndicalist menace, is open to discussion regarding the punishing clauses of the Montreal Agreement. Wilhelm Miklas can't help but feel pride over this achievement, having shown the international scene that Danubia, a nation of many people, is a champion of peace in a divided Europe."
 krg_ita_dnf.3.a: "For peace!"

 krg_ita_dnf.4.t: "Italy Rejects our Proposal"
 krg_ita_dnf.4.d: "As the days passed, the minister-president kept waiting for the response of the Italian foreign ministry. To him, this proposal was one of the last major policies of his permiership, one defined by many sleepless nights and days arguing about the status of the federation in the Weltkrieg. Just as he was about to delve deeper in his thoughts, his secretary brought him a letter sent from Rome, personally written by the Italian foreign minister. After reading it, a feeling of dissappointment filled the face of Miklas. \n\n Although the foreign ministry of the Kingdom of Italy was open to the proposal, many of members within the governing coalition ultimately denied this motion, seeing it as a betrayal of their national ideals. The minister-president could do nothing but place the paper to his side, thinking what further developments will disturb this uneasy peace on the continent. "
 krg_ita_dnf.4.a: "They'll come around"

 krg_ita_dnf.5.t: "Row over Italian-Danubian diplomacy"
 krg_ita_dnf.5.d: "While the streets of many Italian cities may look full of tranquility and content, this could not be further from the truth in the parliament. Deputies from most of the political organizations continue to fight with one another on the issue of the Robert Affair. The current coalition is facing the most internal struggle, as neither faction is willing to agree on whether it is a good decision to trust the Vienna authorities or not. But, on the other side of the chamber lies the oppositon, just as disunited as their political opponents, and with conflict only on the rise, uncertainty begins to take roots in the minds of many."
 krg_ita_dnf.5.a: "Order, order!"

 krg_ita_dnf.6.t: "Ettore Viola Criticises the Government"
 krg_ita_dnf.6.d: "In the newly rebuilt city of Rome, it was but a normal start of the week. With men going off to work and children packing up for school, it would seem that nothing was out of the ordinary. That was, until a large group of people gathered around a single individual. Seeing this, two police officers approached the seemingly suspicious crown in order to see the cause of the commotion. But to their surprise, the man at the center of attention was none other than Ettore Viola, soldier in the First Weltkrieg and president of the Veterans Association. When questioned about his arrival in Rome, he answered that he was here only to speak out his mind. What followed was an hour long speech, filled with shouting, tears and heartfelt recollections of his fallen comrades. The essence of his message was clear: that the Italian government has clearly forgotten the ultimate sacrifice that many brave soldiers had taken in the name of the Italian nation only three decades ago."
 krg_ita_dnf.6.a: "Like it or not, his words carry weight"

 krg_ita_dnf.7.t: "Nationalist Protests"
 krg_ita_dnf.7.d: "Protestors can be heard everyday in the big streets of Torino, Rome and many other cities. While most are not ideologically similar to each other, they hold one common sentiment, that being of nationalist fervour. Patriotic outrage is at an all time high due to the Robert Affair becoming public knowledge, with people ranging from syndicalists to conservatives sharing an anti-Danubian way of thinking. Observers, whether from abroad or from our country, compare this seemingly spontaneous outpoor of chauvinistic outrage to Italy's entry into the First Weltkrieg. Individuals who haven't picked a side in this conflict of interest have remarked with great concern that things could spiral out of control if the government does not responsed in a proper manner. But so far, authorities have been unable to give an official answer."
 krg_ita_dnf.7.a: "This is getting dangerous now!"

 krg_ita_dnf.8.t: "The National Defence League"
 krg_ita_dnf.8.d: "Recent developments in the Italian parliament show that due to the outburst of the general population, many ultranationlist from the PPI, DS and other major parties have formed an unofficial alliance, as a show of force to the pacifists in the chamber. By their side lie the conservative monarchists, who have not been willing to show Danubian officials any good will since the start of this debacle. This act of conservative unity was unseen in Italian politics, having happened before in 1918 following our disastrous defeat at Caporetto. This may be a roadblock to coalition officials, but Giuseppe Pella's cabinet is confident in their ability to manoeuvre around this temporary setback, seeing as nationalist demonstrations are slowly fading in number."
 krg_ita_dnf.8.a: "Maybe we have weathered the crisis by ignoring it?"

 krg_ita_dnf.9.t: "Giuseppe Pella Removed from All PPI Positions"
 krg_ita_dnf.9.da: "It was but a normal morning for Giuseppe Pella, as he prepare himself for the parliament session that was about to ensue. But to his horror, the meeting would turn out to be his last as leader of the Partito Popolare Italiano. After the first issues were discussed, Pella held a speech in the chamber, something which became a common occurrence. Unbeknownst to him, a pro-Danubian faction had secretly built up in opposition to his nationalist rhetoric and conservative stance in this affair. \n\n This group of parliamentaries was lead by Attilio Piccioni, a moderate in comparison to Pella, and to many within the party a more fitting candidate in these times. The acting prime minister could only watch as his fellow comrades voted in favour of his removal, and in only a matter of hours, Italy's government had collapsed."
 krg_ita_dnf.9.db: "Headlines on newspapers all reported in unison on same and following day: Prime minister Giuseppe Pella removed by a vote of no confidence. \n\n This was, of course, and embarrassing turn of events. The once grandee of the nationalists within the People's Party of Italy, now removed from all positions of power. What did the catholic conservatives, who supported him throughout most of his term say? But was to be mentioned at this time, as a once unstoppable political titan crumbled in mere hours together with his legacy. Times will never stop changing, but not all people are able to adapt to its new challenges."
 krg_ita_dnf.9.a: "A politician for a different age"

 krg_ita_dnf.10.t: "Benedetto Croce's Speech"
 krg_ita_dnf.10.d: "Esteemed philosopher and senator Benedetto Croce delivered a speech today in the city of Torino. For nationalist, mister Croce was seen as their representative in the upper chamber of politics, and a voice of reason against syndicalist and Austrian influence which have been plaguing the kingdom. But, to people that have remained uninterested in the conflict, this speech had no effect on their mindset. What were mere civilians, who were still recovering from the aftermath of Italian reunification, supposed to do in this situation? Public reception to anti-reconciliation demonstrations has been slowly going down as of late, and combined with the recent dismissal of Pella, this may be the last stand of the nationalists."
 krg_ita_dnf.10.a: "Unfortunately, Italy will have to endure this"

 krg_ita_dnf.11.t: "The Sidelining of the Nationalists"
 krg_ita_dnf.11.d: "The removal of Giuseppe Pella from his position of influence brought us previously unknown opportunity to deepen our ties with Danubia. Due to the nationalist views of the former high-ranking PPI official, many chauvinists got the chance to publicly express their opinions on the streets, all while our government went through a major crisis. Luckily, with his departure, major oppostion members have have also followed suit, and thus only opened the door to further cooperation with the Danubian Federation."
 krg_ita_dnf.11.a: "Let's get to work then"

 krg_ita_dnf.12.t: "Premature End of the Villa Giusti Summit"
 krg_ita_dnf.12.d: "When midnight struck on the border that separated the Kingdom and Republic of France, the world could only watch as the titans of the European and North American continents clashed against one another. The partners of each superpower could either join the madness, or witness the insanity of mankind unrave before them. Unfortunately, the Italian nation chose the former option, and has just called off the Villa Giusti summit. Officials from Vienna could not understand their position in any way, but still attempted to keep the rival signatory in talks, however that endeavour did not succeed."
 krg_ita_dnf.12.a: "Italy comes first!"
 krg_ita_dnf.12.b: "Wait, no!"

 krg_ita_dnf.13.t: "Italy renounces the Montreal Agreement" # DNF only
 krg_ita_dnf.13.d: "Shocking news have recently come from our southern neighbour. With them having renounced the Montreal Agreement, the outbreak of the Third Weltkrieg must have clouded the judgement of the Kingdom of Italy. None of our advisors could have predicted this turn of events. After all of our goodwill towards them, they decided to tread on the only agreement that maintained our uneasy peace?\n\n Such an act of agression could very well spark another war in the region, or perhaps even worse, extend the reach of the new Weltkrieg to central Europe. Are they out of their minds?! "
 krg_ita_dnf.13.a: "Wait, this wasn't supposed to happen!"

 krg_ita_dnf.14.t: "A New Radious May"
 krg_ita_dnf.14.d: "With the recent developments that have occurred, we have observed how the brave people of the French Republic have finally stood up to the German Imperialist war machine. Italians all around the country, in a fit of patriotism and solidarity towards our latin brethren, have taken out to the streets to show their support to the cause of the Accord. However, this turn of events also brings up an opportunity, one which in the eyes of many was lost not too long ago: the nullification of the Montreal Agreement. Not only would we serve in the interest of the Italian nation and its people, but also showcase the world that the descendants of Rome are a force to be reckoned with."
 krg_ita_dnf.14.a: "We can use this for good, can't we?"

 krg_ita_dnf.15.t: "Italy Renounces the Montreal Agreement"
 krg_ita_dnf.15.d: "With most of the European continent finding itself at war once again, the Italian government has recently referred to the Montreal Agreement and its clauses, many of which restricted the country militarily, as being "null and void". This speech came as a result of the declaration of war between the Reichspakt, faction lead by the Germany, and the Accord, an alliance of nations headed by the Canadian government. \n\n Many international observers that have been paying attention to Italian-Danubian relations since the unification of the peninsula, determined that this provocation came as a result of Italian oportunism, seeing it as the last chance to take possession of their claims in the Balkan peninsula."
 krg_ita_dnf.15.a: "How dare they!"
 krg_ita_dnf.15.b: "We will wield our full strength for Liberty"
 krg_ita_dnf.15.c: "This is sure to anger Vienna..."

 krg_ita_dnf.16.t: "The Villa Giusti Summit"
 krg_ita_dnf.16.d: "The delegates sent out by both the Danubian Federation and the Kingdom of Italy have made the first step of discussing the friendship treaty, that being the choosing a location. While the representatives of Vienna suggested villages located in the Austrian Alps, the Italian foreign minister proposed to meet in the demilitarized province of Padua, in a local residence known as Villa Giusti del Giardino. The opposing delegates, seeing no issue in visiting territories that have been forced to not host any military presence, agreed to this recommendation."
 krg_ita_dnf.16.a: "Send out the invitations!"
 krg_ita_dnf.16.b: "We'll be there!"

 krg_ita_dnf.17.t: "The Delegates Arrive"
 krg_ita_dnf.17.d: "With all the preparations completed, the Danubian foreign ministry and his close advisors arrived to the stunning residence together with Archduke Robert, the nobleman who started this whole ordeal. During that tense moment when the delegates entered the negotiating room, the hosting representatives could not think of any other fitting welcoming gift but one. The welcoming delegation brought wine made by the Benanti brand, famous all throughout the country for its rich and deep aroma, a gift which was enthusiastically accepted by their Austrian counterparts."
 krg_ita_dnf.17.a: "Welcome!"
 krg_ita_dnf.17.b: "Thank you for the hospitality!"

 krg_ita_dnf.18.t: "Opposition in the Italian Senate"
 krg_ita_dnf.18.d: "To the surprise of no one, some members with nationalistic tendencies from within the Italian Senate still voiced their opposition to the draft. While their opinions will not hinder the progress made in these discussions, this symbolic gesture only serves to show that this polarizing affair cannot be resolved in a rash manner. Many Italian nationals feel entitled to their the lands of Tirol and Istria, with even more citizens remembering the horrors and trauma their relatives suffered in the First Weltkrieg in order to unite all Italians under one banner."
 krg_ita_dnf.18.a: "Drat!"
 krg_ita_dnf.18.b: "Let's hope this won't sink the deal..."

 krg_ita_dnf.19.t: "The Summit Continues"
 krg_ita_dnf.19.d: "Regardless of whether the senate in Rome voices its "vehement opposition" to the summit, the reality of the situation was that the delegates were sent to discuss the future of not just Italy and Danubia, but peace in the entire southern hemisphere of Europe. To their dismay, the official bill that was to put a stop to negotiations did not pass when a voting motion was called on the subject. Many within the goverment breath a sigh of relief after being informed of the result, and officials only encouraged the foreign ministry to continue."
 krg_ita_dnf.19.a: "All thanks to our political acumen!"
 krg_ita_dnf.19.b: "Thank the Lord!"

 krg_ita_dnf.20.t: "Smoothing Over the Robert Affair"
 krg_ita_dnf.20.d: "After many hours of endless talks, the foreign ministers of both attestant nations, the ones that were leading the discourse finally made a breakthrough. The Kingdom of Italy and the Danubian Federation will continue the dialogue on the basis of the preliminary agreement brought by Archduke Robert to Rome. While many negotiators from the Italian corner would have wished for a more advantageous outcome, this is still a positive result that has come out of this meeting. "
 krg_ita_dnf.20.a: "We don't have to worry about nationalist backlash now"
 krg_ita_dnf.20.b: "This could have been simpler..."

 krg_ita_dnf.21.t: "The Final Draft"
 krg_ita_dnf.21.d: "When the dawn of the morning sun made its appereance, the draft of the friendship treaty was all but finalized. The contents of this agreement are quite simple, but critical for the continuation of relations between the two states. Both prime ministers are to sign a Non-agression pact which will force any possible agressor from attacking a signatory, followed by a mutual defence agreement. The most important detail of this draft however is the abolition of the military and economic restrictions enforced by the Montreal Agreement, which includes the demilitarization of the province of Veneto."
 krg_ita_dnf.21.a: "Let's get the Prime Ministers involved, shall we?"
 krg_ita_dnf.21.b: "What a great conclusion!"

 krg_ita_dnf.22.t: "The Treaty of Villa Giusti"
 krg_ita_dnf.22.d: "For decades, neither the Austrian or the Italian prime ministers have met on equal footing, much less communicate in a civil and respectul manner. But, today marks the beginning of a new dawn on the topic of relations between the two states. One of the signatories, that being the Kingdom of Italy, who chose to swallow its pride and accept the status quo, will withdraw their claims upon Tyrol and other Balkan territories. On the opposing side of the table lies the representative of the Danubian Federation, which is bound to abolish most of the clauses that limit the potential of the Italian military and economy. This meeting was not closed with formal parting words, but a cool glass of champagne, one only worthy of such a joyous occasion."
 krg_ita_dnf.22.a: "Peace in the East has been achieved!"
 krg_ita_dnf.22.b: "Our southern flank is secured!"

 krg_ita_dnf.23.t: "The Treaty of Villa Giusti"
 krg_ita_dnf.23.d: "Today, the residence of Giusti del Giardino in Northern Italy, the Italian and Danubian foreign ministers signed the Treaty of Villa Giusti, a protocol that aims at bettering the relations between the two countries. While both sides conceded on certain points, the territorial claims of Kingdom of Italy were at the focal point of the meeting. While a large amount of the population and political scene completely opposed open talks with the authorities from Vienna, the force of reason has finally made the Italians accept their position. With this treaty, both signatories expect their relations to improve, as both sides do not hold territorial claims against one another, and combined with an almost guaranteed increase in trade and diplomatic ties, the prospect of European peace grounds itself more and more in reality."
 krg_ita_dnf.23.a: "A toast to our new friendship!"
 krg_ita_dnf.23.b: "A light in a polarised world"

 krg_ita_dnf.24.t: "Pacifist Counter-Protests"
 krg_ita_dnf.24.d: "From the beginning of this diplomatic entanglement, the vast majority of Italians wanted nothing more but to wipe out Austrian influence from our nation, even if that meant to completely ruin our standing with the Habsburg monarchy. Many nationalists from all over the political spectrum united in their common hatred for the Danubian Federation, some even going as far to form anti-pacifist paramilitaries in order to hinder the progress of the agreement. But, in a twist of fate, in a recent police clash with warmongering demonstrators, pacifist counter-protesters joined the on the side of the authorities in order to quell the bloodthirsty crowd. \n\n Needless to say, the pacifist individuals who have shown their support for the cause of peace in Europe have been rewarded a small amount of money. But for the government, this is only a testament to the benefits that the people of Italy will be rewarded with if we maintain this tranquil status quo."

Until 1885, several private companies controlled the railways; that year, the Government merged them into 4 main companies, that were eventually nationalised in 1905. By then, the Italian railways were deeply outdated; and the modernisation programs launched before the Great War would be cut short when the country fell apart.\n\nNow, an unitary railway administration has been restored; with the rail network several decades behind its European counterparts by now, deep reform and investments will be needed to give Italy the infrastructure needed for a full industrialisation.\n\nThere is currently §YL [?Railway_funds] billion§! available for investment"

 ITA_impossible_coalition_right_desc: "§LWhile one may talk about leftist infighting, the smaller Liberal Party also sees an impressive amount of internal strife. This was partially eased by its shedding of the National Democratic Liberal Concentration and the Common Man's Front in the mid '40s - still, the strong anti-socialist beliefs of the Old Liberal Guard mean we may still see opposition coming from what are ostensibly our natural allies.§!\n\n§sMondo§!\n§LUnited around Mario Pannunzio's Mondo newspaper, this faction of the Liberal Party is formed by a number of progressives - and even republicans - who still maintain their ideological link with the Liberals of old. These 'radicals' are the closest allies we have within the Liberal Party, and indeed many wonder why they haven't jumped ship to the DS.§!\n\n§INew Liberals§!\n§LMuch of the Liberal Party is by now formed by a new generation of Liberals - not beholden to the old dominant and somewhat anti-ideological prewar Liberalism, and instead looking towards remaining the party of the growing middle class through economic ideals. Following the new 'liberist' theories of famous philosopher Benedetto Croce, they advocate for a small government, low taxation and similar policies to promote small business.§!\n\n§gOld Guard§!\n§LThe bulk of the Liberal Party remains the wide array of politicians who grew up in the political arena preceding the Great War. With many respected statesmen among them - including Enrico de Nicola and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando - the radical changes Italy experienced since 1910 turned the once hegemonic force into little more than a fringe. While they sympathise with our attempts to bring democratic Liberalism into a new era, they remain markedly more conservative than the DS and will oppose us if we steer too far to the left.\nIf §Y§SCDP§!

Even after a failed attempt to form a National Bloc of the wider right, a few old-school Qualunquists remain in the party, though they are less than willing to work together with former SRI politicians.\nIf §Y§SCDP§!

In this peculiar way they are almost identical to the old Liberals, which will be a problem when trying to keep the mass parties - both the PPI and our allies on the left - at bay.\n\n§sThe Left§!\nSporting the likes of former Milan Republic president Ivanoe Bonomi, Luigi Gasparotto and Francesco Saverio Nitti, the line between this faction and the right wing of the CDP isn't clear; indeed, some take inspiration from PDL leader Giacomo Matteotti, long time ally of Bonomi. The Left includes various movements descending from the Radical supporters of Giolitti; here, strong radical liberal and reformist socialist traditions coexist almost peacefully.\n\n§IThe Regionalists§!\nStanding in the centre are a wide variety of regional movements, from the Sicilian Independence Movement to the Sardinian Action Party to the Italian Farmers' Party. Their ideological positions vary wildly even inside the minor parties themselves; they are united only by their support of some form of federalist compromise. Though members of this faction rarely attempt to enter nation-wide politics, Alessandro Scotti has recently achieved a place of great importance within the wider DS.\n\n§BThe Right§!\nThe right wing of the party is led by old radicals who drifted right in the interwar period, and can be considered to be about as right wing as the mainstream Liberal Party - the two fighting for votes but also considering each other natural allies. Significantly anti-syndicalist and ardently monarchist, its de facto leader is considered to be Tullio Benedetti, a former protégé of Nitti who later became associated with General Bencivenga of the FMC.§!"

 ### LEADERS DESCRIPTIONS ###
 UMBERTO_II_LEADER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 15th, 1904\nRacconigi, Piedmont, Kingdom of Italy\n§W--------------§!\nWhen his father abdicated for both himself and his son in 1919, Umberto had thought everything lost. With the country in heavy turmoil and Emanuele Filiberto rising to take control of Sardinia, Umberto chose to lay low in the new Italy; though he didn't follow his father in exile, he went on to serve in the military and avoided the press and courtly life. An exception was his marriage to Marie-José, Princess of Belgium, in 1930, though he effectively disappeared from the public eye afterwards.\n\nRecalled into active service in 1939, he went on to command a number of defensive coastal installations in northern Sardinia; in this capacity he led the Royalist forces in the Battle of Santa Teresa in June 1940, earning a commendation for his bravery and ending any Red hope of taking Sardinia and Corsica. This, coupled with his low profile and apolitical position propelled him to the forefront of Italian politics in the summer of 1941.\n\nWith the fall of the Integralist dictatorship in the Two Sicilies, the various White governments of Italy had agreed to form an united government to coordinate the war effort, headed by Marshal Caviglia; though they could not agree on a head of State. The deadlock was broken when Caviglia proposed Umberto take the throne at least temporarily, with a referendum to be held on the issue once the war was won. As such, Umberto ascended to the throne in September 1941.\n\nBecoming the subject of much propaganda, Umberto became legitimately popular; and he gained the goodwill of the political forces when he appointed the radical Nitti to head a government once Caviglia had resigned, in spite of pressures in favour of Marshal Badoglio, at a time in which a military takeover seemed inevitable.\n\nAll this, coupled with the Duke of Aosta's own feats leading the reborn Third Army, gave the Monarchy a lot of much needed support; when the Institutional Referendum eventually came in 1946, the Monarchy won a comfortable victory.\n\nStill, for all his popularity, Umberto must not grow complacent - as he himself said, \"the Monarchy must be a beloved symbol, otherwise it is nothing\"."
