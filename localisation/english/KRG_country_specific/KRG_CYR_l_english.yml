krg_cyr_news.0.t: "Cyrenaica opens to Oil Prospecting"
krg_cyr_news.0.d: "The theocratic regime of Idris I today signed into law the '1953 Minerals Law' which permits the surveying of and prospecting for oil in the Libyan Desert. Already, there is excitement amongst professionals in the industry, who are looking forward to a potential pay-day in the desert.\n\nThere are also geopolitical ramifications, as the fading influence of the Cairo Pact on the global stage might be once again reignited by a significant discovery."
krg_cyr_news.0.a: "We'll keep our eyes peeled."

krg_cyr_news.1.t: "Cyrenaica Petroleum Law Passed"
krg_cyr_news.1.d: "The Senussi Idris I regime has signed into law the '1955 Petroleum Law' which established a Petroleum Commission who will have the final say in the granting of concessions and the authorisation to drill oil wells.\n\nSome minor controversy was reported as initial drafts apparently held provisions for provincial governors to appoint people to the Commission and to veto drilling in their province. However Idris I has stated that in this case, national interest overrides it.\n\nWith the passage of this law, several concessionaires are seeking an audience with the commission in order to begin operations, and the balance of power between Egypt and Cyrenaica looks to be changing..."
krg_cyr_news.1.a: "Drill baby, drill!"

krg_cyr_news.2.t: "Coup d'État in Cyrenaica"
krg_cyr_news.2.d: "The Senussi Idris I regime fell today under the auspices of a 'Revolutionary Command Council' (RCC) headed by a Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The RCC has stated their goal was to end the injustice in distribution of the oil revenues that had grown increasingly large since the 1955 Petroleum Law had led to exploitation of Libya's incredible oil reserves.\n\nHaving served in the military since his youth, Colonel Gaddafi's Arab Nationalism comes his heritage as the descendant of a poor Bedouin family. He looks set to lead the country on a modernising drive, and to bring Cyrenaica into the 20th Century."
