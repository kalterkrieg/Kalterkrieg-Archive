MAF_decentralised_authority_trait: "Decentralised Authority"
AAPM_Central_Committee_Desc: "The Central Committee of the All African People's Movement is very much a reflection of the difficult circumstances in which it was created. The need for each wing of the movement to be able to act quickly and independently of the others, as well as the need for the movement to be able to adapt to potential german crackdowns, means that it lacks any official figurehead. This is also part of the compromises which allowed the organisation to be created, as the more extreme ends of the political compass could only be brought into the movement with the assurances that the others would not be dictating their actions.\n\nMost of all, it is reflective of the fact that the All African People's Movement is not, in fact, a single movement. It is a hundred organisations and partisan groups under one banner, as varied as the people of its continent. Whilst victory over the German oppressors has galvanised the pan-african sentiments of these groups, the fate of the movement will be dictated by a hundred opposing agendas."

MAF_bloated_admin: "Gargantuan Administration"
MAF_bloated_admin_desc: "Mittelafrika is a bundle of colonies held together by layers upon layers of bureaucracy (and the occasional iron-fisted intervention of the Colonial Military). Spanning half a continent, administrators and bureaucrats are found from highland to jungle, responsible for a slew of tasks from managing production quotas to coordinating with local kings and chiefs. Whilst efforts have been made to try and cull the administration and its bureaucracy, the fear that a reduced bureaucracy would mean the outright collapse of the delicate balance of the Mittelafrikan system has left any attempts to reduce said administration unfinished. The War did not help these efforts, as increased quotas and massive logistical issues thanks to the African Conscript system, lead to the administration ballooning even further. Yet, even at its current size, some still feel that the Mittelafrikan administration is 'undermanned'. The cost of conquering half a continent is becoming all too real, will there be enough Germans to man Germany's greatest jewel?"
MAF_thyssen_reform: "Thyssen's Reforms"
MAF_thyssen_reform_desc: "Thyssen's reckless predecessor almost brought Mittelafrika to ruin and it was only the timely intervention of the current Governor, Fritz Thyssen, which brought stability to the region. The so-called (and rather unimaginatively named) 'Thyssen Reforms' rolled back many of the most disastrous policies alongside a dozen token concessions to both local leaders and native population. These stopgap measures have kept the region from collapsing during a delicate period of warfare but will not keep everyone satisfied for long."
MAF_conscripts_return: "The Conscripts' Return"
MAF_conscripts_return_desc: "Mittelafrika has been present on every front of the war. Whether that be materials mined from its bountiful quarries or the manpower lifted from its population, German's largest and supposedly greatest colony has been a vital part of the Reichspakt's war effort. This has not come without cost to the colony however. The scale of this total war has left ordinary life in the colonies disrupted, with quotas enforced harshly and commodities becoming increasingly scarce.\n\nYet there are some ramifications which are far more subtle. Conscripts who have fought the world over are now returning home, their heads filled with new ideas which had previously not disseminated through the Afircan continent. Only a fool would think that Mittelafrika will be able to return to its prior status quo..."

Even the most unified movements for independence within our organisation still have their splinters, rival organisations, or ideological opposites. Our victory against the German oppressors has further galvanised these forces, with many partisan groups already breaking apart at the seams.

MAF.1.t: "A Conference In Accra"
MAF.1.d: "Events in Madagascar had galvanised the proceedings.\n\nIt was their third meeting, a culmination of years of planning and careful diplomacy, though it was their first together with all involved. Through blood and sweat, they had brought a veritable spectrum of ideology together, every last proponent of African independence was present. There were syndicalists, there were socialists, conservatives, liberals, and even a small contingent of monarchists. Some of them had served in the Conscripts, some had never left Mittelafrika. Most were fierce nationalists, some believed in a more unified future for Africa. Despite all these differences, there was a single, unifying thread that had brought them all to this room on this day. Their opposition to continued German rule.\n\nThe lack of space and the humidity could do little to stifle the electric atmosphere. One by one, speakers had been invited to the stage, speaking to men who once might have been their rivals plainly, they spoke of their homes, of the crimes committed against them, and most importantly of all, freedom. For there could be no freedom under the German boot! There could be no future which was not African! And there could be no peace until that future was theirs! By protest or by conflict, they would fight for it.\n\nBy the end of the day, as they ducked out into the night, careful to avoid those prying eyes which might be watching, the excruciating negotiations had finally produced a concrete result. They had a new banner to unite before. They had a purpose."
MAF.1.a: "The Movement for Africa Has Begun."

MAF.2.t: "Straight From Berlin"
MAF.2.d: "The most powerful man in Africa was, for lack of a better word, shattered. The last week had been a flurry of activity, meetings after meetings. The German Victory in the Kalterkrieg was a success like no other and had rightly deserved to be celebrated. However, it had also left the land brutalised by war. Parts of the Rheinland were unrecognisable. Germany had suffered and now, more than ever, it needed space to breathe and rebuild. That, as always, was were Thyssen came in.\n\nA colonial administration the size of a continent was bound to produce any number of problems, especially one which had just endured many grueling years of strict wartime policy, but they were not problems which the Berlin administration could divert immense resources or time toward when the immense task of reconstruction was being handled. Thus, the week of meetings had essentially boiled down to one, simple message; Keep Mittelafrika stable, keep it quiet, and keep it budgeted. It was the same reason he had been appointed as Governor all those years ago. It was a task he would face with relish, even as he so desperately wanted to sleep right now. Instead, he worked."
MAF.2.a: "He carries the continent's weight on his shoulders."

MAF.3.t: "Winding down the War Machine"
MAF.3.d: "Mittelafrika has, for the last five years, been dedicated for one purpose entirely; Total War. From the highest levels of the bureaucracy to the common man, everyone has been expected to pull their weight and in some manner contribute towards the war effort. This has meant a dozen different things for a dozen different people. Corporations have been granted lucrative contracts to supply the Kaiserreich with valuable resources, workers have been expected to pull long shifts for little pay, homemakers encouraged to make the most of their pots and pans to reduce the colony's reliance on steel, and indeed vast quantities of the men of Mittelafrika have been pushed into Thyssen's African Conscripts, who now begin the long journey home.\n\nThis devotion to the act of war, however, cannot and should not last forever. Already, the population has grown weary of the rationing and the quotas, the individual and community sacrifices that were made in the name of 'freedom from godless syndicalism'. Thyssen, of all people, knows this and today has officially made the first calls to his cabinet that Mittelafrika should begin demobilisation with all haste! Whilst the great bureaucratic machinery of Mittelafrika will take some time to kick into gear, the administration is optimistic that demobilisation can be finished by the end of the year."
MAF.3.a: "Then was the time for war, now is the time for peace."

MAF.4.t: "Welcome To Mittelafrika!"
MAF.4.d: "Stretching from the West African coast, to the vast territories of the former Belgian Congo, and into East Africa, where the land reaches the Indian Ocean; All these lands hoist the flag of Germany and, alongside it, the flag of the Mittelafrikan Administration. Formed in haste and a desire for total German dominance of the African Continent, Mittelafrika has been the crown jewel of the German colonial empire for nearly thirty years now.\n\nYet Mittelafrika is a colony in crisis and it has been since its inception. The vast scale of the Mittelafrikan project means that Germany must invest vast amounts of resources into Mittelafrika to maintain their hold over it, as there are many who would happily see the Colony collapse into turmoil. This essentially means that, for almost the entirety of its existence, Mittelafrika has failed to turn a profit. Even when Governor Ritter took charge in the dark years of the 30s, his ambitious plans to transform the colony into a cash cow led only to further economic turmoil.\n\nEven though the current Governor, Fritz Thyssen, managed to rescue the colony from utter collapse, it has required massive compromise and the colony still remains in dire shape. Internal factions riddle the Mittelafrikan administration and external allies make greater and greater demands for their support.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the next years will decide the fate of Mittelafrika and, perhaps, the fate of the entire African continent."
MAF.4.a: "Tell me about the five factions"
MAF.4.b: "Do I look like an amateur?"

MAF.5.t: "Governor's Briefing 1: The Administration"
MAF.5.d: "The main driving force behind the organisation and day-to-day running of Mittelafrika is the Administration, known as the Reichskolonialamt, and previously known as the Neu Reichskolonialamt. Born from Thyssen's ruthless assimilation of the fractured groups which once formed the Mittelafrikan political scene, the gradual restoration of calm has led to a new blossoming of political alliances and factions. Though once there was only three groups worth considering, there is now five.\n\nThe Conservative Bureaucrats are the largest faction within the Reichskolonialamt and are the most orthodox group of the administration. Formed largely of veteran administrators and governors, as well as their protégés, the Conservative Bureaucrats are most well-versed in the running of Mittelafrika and advocate for the most cautious approach to events, most likely as they are the most likely to know how delicate the bureaucracy is. These men form Thyssen's traditional powerbase and their policy has been the guiding hand behind his reforms.\n\nThe Interventionists are usually the group most closely aligned with the Conservative Bureaucrats. Formed of the most militant members of the administration, the Interventionists boast close ties to the continent's garrisons. Interventionists promote a hardline and direct approach to internal matters, discouraging reliance on our Administration's allies.\n\nThe Pragmatists can be considered the main opposition to the reign of the Conservative Bureaucrats. Formed of the marginally more liberally minded bureaucrats, administrators, and governors, Pragmatists advocate for marginal reform to ensure a continued existence of the Mittelafrikan project. Do not mistake them for anti-colonials, for some are the most rabidly pro-colonial men you could find.\n\nWhereas Conservative Bureaucrats, Interventionists, and Pragmatists form the 'big three' factions, a new faction has coalesced in the dying years of the Weltkrieg. The Berliners are groomed politicians from the German mainland. Men without much experience but with many connections. Exhaustingly Pro-German, their agenda worryingly reminds some of the disastrous reign of Ritter...\n\nLastly, there exists a small coalition of outwardly liberal politicians and administrators, the Realists. Their name famously assigned to them by Thyssen as a joke, the Realists contend that Mittelafrika as a whole is doomed and that the only chance for continued German presence in Africa is an utter reconstruction of the colony, focused on the so-called 'core colonies'."
MAF.5.a: "What about our allies?"

MAF.6.t: "Governor's Briefing 2: The AdEA"
MAF.6.d: "To the average German or continental folk, Mittelafrika is a German affair through and through, dominated by a vast German bureaucracy. Looking past the propaganda, however, one soon realises that the patchwork reality of the Mittelafrikan project means that, by necessity, the Administration relies upon, and grants limited power, to the vast interests of the AdEA interest group, the face of the conglomerates and corporations of Afrika.\n\nWhilst they wield no official power within the structures of the colony, these corporations are responsible for the maintenance and administration of huge swathes of land across the continent. In some areas, the influence of the German administration is so little and the operations of the corporations so great that many workers will not even be aware of the German administration and isolated villages still remain blissfully unaware of the greater German presence. Still, these corporations provide a massive sum of Mittelafrika's profits, with their mining operations bringing in vast amounts of reichsmarks for the administration. The war has only benefitted this symbiotic relationship, with German contracts providing vast freedoms to the corporations in return for massively important supplies of rubber, copper, and even uranium.\n\nStill, there are some within the Mittelafrikan bureaucracy who resent the presence of these companies, seeing them as mere parasites on the German colonial empire. Though these calls for the companies' influence to be reduced or entirely expelled usually fall on deaf ears, they contribute to an undeniable tension between the two elements."
MAF.6.a: "Any other allies?"

MAF.7.t: "Governor's Briefing 3: The Hardliners"
MAF.7.d: "Ritter's reign in Mittelafrika is viewed as an enormous mistake, one which has been thoroughly buried by Thyssen and his allies. Still, there remains one odd artifact from Ritter's time as Governor; The Hardliners.\n\nThough they're origins remains rather clouded, the Hardliners was used as a tool to secure Thyssen's new command of the colony and something through which he could secure the political power necessary to push through his new reforms. Since then, they have become a different beast entirely. To most, the Hardliners is nothing more than a group for German Settlers found in both city and isolated community alike, the Hardliners provide a chance for the Mittelafrikan gentleman to relax and discuss politics in a fine environment. As one ascends up the rungs of Mittelafrikan bureaucracy, however, it becomes clear that the Hardliners wield an immense amount of political clout. They brand themselves as the protectors of the rights of the German Settler, the group which keeps the administration in check, the first line of defense against any who might undermine their priveleges, and they are immensely popular as a result of this. When they are your ally, the Hardliners provides a vital insight into the mind of the average German Settler. When they are your enemy, they are a voracious beast which can bring entire sections of Mittelafrika to a halt."
MAF.7.a: "The last spectre of Herr Ritter..."

MAF.8.t: "Governor's Briefing 5: The Resistance Groups"
MAF.8.d: "Resistance in Mittelafrika has existed as long as, well, Mittelafrika. Not everyone profits from the Mittelafrikan project, least of all the average african worker, who is often worked to the bone in dire conditions for the profit of corporation and colony. Thus, it is not uncommon for groups of every variety to emerge and attempt to push their agenda of the day. The truth is that there is little unified which can be written about these groups on one page, as their sheer diversity makes it difficult to discuss what they have in common. There exists monarchist groups and syndicalist groups, federalists and regionalists, men who wish to see the German pushed from his continent and men who simply wish to see better work conditions for himself and his workers.\n\nHowever, much to the detriment of these agitators, we have two great weapons on our side. The first has already been mentioned. The diversity of these groups means that common ground is often rare, a unified front near impossible. Our second weapon is distance. Mittelafrika is enormous, an entire continent for us to rule! Most resistance groups are confined to their portion of the colony. These small groups of resistance, hundreds of miles apart, are hardly a match for our regional garrisons and the askari."
MAF.8.a: "Enough talk!"

MAF.9.t: "Governor's Briefing 4: The Protectorates"
MAF.9.d: "Mittelafrika is often described as patchwork and, to some extent, this is true. There are patches which Germany claims direct dominion over and there are patches over which Germany is simply providing a guiding hand. These latter patches fall under one common name; The Protectorates.\nThe Protectorates are lands in which the natives of Africa still maintain some modicum of control over their land, though naturally it is only a minute portion of the population who holds any real power. The Kings and Chieftains of these lands are as numerous and as diverse as any group of people but they are united by a singular common thread, a desire to maintain their privileges and to hold onto every last scrap of power. It was only recently, however, that they gained any official capacity to act within the machinery of Mittelafrika, however, thanks to the Thyssen Reforms. These enabled the creation of the Committee of Native Affairs, an apparatus through which the Protectorates could somewhat influence colonial policy, or at least have their voices heard. The truth is that the Committee is a largely toothless organisation. Though, for now, it keeps the peace, many suspect that it might prove ineffective when Mittelafrika faces its next great threat."
MAF.9.a: "Some allies they are."

MAF.10.t: "Thyssen's Vision"
MAF.10.d: "The way forward was clear, in order to combat the immense problems faced by the German colonial administration, immense changes would have to be made in kind. Yes, there was the loming issue of demobilization, but the future Thyssen was envisioning went beyond that. Between cleaning up Ritter's mess and the Second Weltkrieg itself, so much of his tenure as Governor was consumed by putting out fires he didn't start. The African continent was home to vast riches still untapped, and the companies operating in Mittelafrika had only begun to scratch surface of that material wealth. Thyssen was confident that this was the key to rejuvenating the stagnant German administration and set up whoever would come after him for success. It had to be made clear that Africa was open for business, and that the Imperial Colonial Office would not impede industrious settlers or entrepeneurs. Once some sense of order was restored to the economy, and the benefits made their way down the common person, surely the simmering unrest would die down as well.\n\nEnding the colony's troubles may not be possible before the end of his tenure, but Thyssen would be dammned if he wasn't going to set the wheels in motion."
MAF.10.a: "Failure is out of the question."

MAF.11.t: "Handling the Strikes"
MAF.11.d: "The strikes, it seems, have not 'fizzled out'. Whilst the feared revolution has also not arrived, it has become apparent that direct intervention will be necessary to put an end to the strike and get the good citizens of Mittelafrika back to work. The decentralised nature of these protests and strikes means there is no central authority to negotiate with and, instead, we must negotiate or break the strikes on an individual basis instead. Thyssen and his inner circle are prepared for the simple fact that this will mean many long, sleepless nights trying to restore some semblance of calm to the damned continent.\n\nStill, it has immediately become apparent where elements of the administration stand on how these strikes should be handled. The Berliners and Interventionists have taken the stance of zero negotiation, instead claiming that the local Askari should 'deal with the threat however necessary'. This approach remains broadly popular in the colony, though Pragmatists and Conservative Bureaucrats have immediately voiced concern that this would damage our demobilisation efforts more than it would help them. Either way, one group or another will be displeased by whichever way we decide to handle this."
MAF.11.a: "A thankless job."

MAF.12.t: "The Strikes End"
MAF.12.d: "Across Mittelafrika the streets of the developed cities have returned to relative calm. Thanks to a combination of concessions when possible and applied force when necessary the strikes which have plagued our colony for the past few months have all but dissapated. While our success means we can turn our full attention back to demobilizing the colony, the long-term ramification of the strikes remain to be seen. The collective action proved to be a crucible for the formation of more organized anti-colonial local leadership, and while things may be calm today, many in the administration are left wondering if the Strikes were merely the first example more organized resistance to German Authority."
MAF.12.a: "Peace. For better or worse."

MAF.13.t: "Strikes hit the colony!"
MAF.13.d: "Whilst the mood in the colony during the war could be best described as sombre, it was generally accepted that the measures taken by the administration were necessary given the threat. So, despite the harsh measures imposed, the war years managed to be some of the most productive to date. It is no surprise, however, that the Administration's announcement of the end of the Weltkrieg and the beginning of demobilisation and disarmament were met with jubilation and a galvanised populace. Where before the thought of a return to the pre-war conditions seemed distant, they are now within grasp! This has prompted a wave of organised strikes to sweep across the colony faster than our garrisons could possibly be prepared for. Miners, clerks, low-level bureaucrats and farmers alike have taken to the streets to demand all manner of things.\n\nImmediately, the response by many within the administration has been absolute panic, fear of a fall to syndicalist revolution sparked some small reprisals across the colony before calm could be restored. Despite this panic, it is quickly becoming abundant that these strikes are not an organised opposition but a response to local shortages and troubles which had been bubbling under the surface. Thus, many have suspected that the Strikes will fizzle out once more demobilisation efforts have been rolled out."
MAF.13.a: "If they could just wait!"

MAF.14.t: "Managing Mittelafrika"
MAF.14.d: "Mittelafrika is vast, unwieldy and just generally hard to manage. Even in an age of wireless communication devices, satellites and hypersonic jets, a nation state would have a hard time existing over such a vast landscape. Now, imagine it is to be done with the technology of the late 1940's and early 1950's. You are reliant on telephone and telegraph lines that might fail or be disrupted, it can take literal weeks for people to attend in person meetings as they travel vast distances. Communication is done by letter when not urgent and hoped that by the time the letter arrives the moment it was required prior to has not passed. Oh, and the population is if not all at odds with your government, certainly harbouring a significant faction who are.\n\nThus there are three immediate concerns - the state of the economy - an amorphous at best mess of vast enterprises and resource extraction that seems to be making someone somewhere money, the state of the military, the cudgel at the back of the native and the guardian of the white settlers, and the state of the bureaucracy - that vast disjointed beast that has it's tentacles everywhere as it tries to hold the colony together in one piece while everything else works against it to spring free.\n\nUnderneath that you also have various political and social movements whose approval you can court to try and create the outcomes you seek."
MAF.14.a: "Hah, good luck! You'll need it."

MAF.15.t: "The End of the Silent Agreement"
MAF.15.d: "When Fritz Thyssen was intially chosen as Governor, many were questioning whether the Mittelafrikan project was sustainably and it appeared that Black Monday had irrevocably broken the colony. Thanks to Thyssen, however, doubts were quashed and the impending disaster was averted, largely due to Thyssen's ability to be utterly ruthless and simultaineously able to compromise. It is an open secret that his ability to operate in such a manner was in large part due to the so-called 'Silent Agreement' between the man himself and the government in Berlin.\n\nThis unspoken agreement between the two parties allowed Thyssen normally unthinable autonomy provided that Thyssen kept the colony of Mittelafrika quiet and functional whilst the Government focused on politics at home, namely Black Monday and, soon after, the Weltkrieg. With Thyssen delivering outstanding results there was no reason for the agreement to be ended and has become a definitive part of his reign. Now it appears that the winds are changing. With the politics of the Weltkrieg era slipping into the past and Germany's attention being drawn back towards the troubling developments of Mittelafrika, Thyssen's position looks shaky and the agreement has all but ended, leading to speculation abound that Thyssen's era is likely drawing to an end sooner rather than later."
MAF.15.a: "No man rules forever."

MAF.16.t: "The East African Strikes"
MAF.16.d: "The issue behind the strikes in East Africa become abundantly clear once one enters the cities on the coast. Tens of thousands of conscript men, fresh from manual labour on the eastern front of the war, are stranded within the coastal cities whilst they await demobilisation and the transportation which will take them home, often spilling out onto the streets and stretching supplies of all kinds thin. The issue has proved to be a bit of a logistical nightmare and it has spiralled out of control in many cities like Dar-es-Salaam, where the local populace has taken to the streets in the face of rising costs.\n\nTwo proposals have been given to Thyssen. From the pragmatists, the idea of taking surplus supplies from some of the less affected colonies and making them immediately available, for little to no cost. The Conservative Bureaucrats have balked at the idea, claiming that such a move would only destabilise the local populace in the long run. Instead, they have proposed that we enforce stricter discipline amongst the Conscripts and keep them under stricter supervision. This should allow the local populace some breathing space and restore some sense of normality."
MAF.16.a: "Make surplus supplies available immediately."
MAF.16.b: "Enforcing military discipline in the Conscripts will calm things down."

MAF.17.t: "The Central African Strikes"
MAF.17.d: "The cry of 'Remember Mpoyi' rings across the cities in Central Africa, as angry men and women take to the street. Where these strikes began on access to commodities such as pots and pans, increasingly rare due to the fatherland's voracious need for resources, they quickly expanded due to the rash actions of one officer. Though it is hard to discern truth from exaggerated fiction, it appears that an officer of the local garrison attempted to negotiate on behalf of our administration with a group of miners who had occupied the local football field in protest of low pay. When efforts to make the miners leave failed and it became clear the officer would not raise their pay, a scuffle broke out. In the ensuring chaos, a number of men were wounded and one man shot and killed, Leonard Mpoyi. The news of this spread like wildfire in the local region and now the men and women on the street are calling for justice.\n\nNaturally, the Conservative Bureaucrats and Interventionists within our administration have argued that reprimanding the men will undercut the confidence of our men and the ability of our garrisons to function. The Pragmatists have argued the opposite, that without reprimanding these men, it will only diminish our control over local garrisons across the continent. Both solutions offered could work..."
MAF.17.a: "Reprimand the men responsible, no exceptions."
MAF.17.b: "Organise some funds for the families, and refrain from reprimands."

MAF.18.t: "The South African Strikes"
MAF.18.d: "With its nucleus centered in the great Rhodesian copper belt, the demands of the south African strikers are more in line with what one would typically expects from militant laborers. Simply put, the conditions in the Zambezian copper mines are miserable and dehumanizing. Though already a less than ideal place to work before the Second Weltkrieg, the mobilization of the economy caused conditions to worsen rapidly, particularly with regards to safety. Now the miners are fed up waiting for our government to take action, and have joined with the general strike occuring across the continent. \n\nThe Conservative Bureaucrats have argued that the miner's grievences are simply a matter of unfortunate timing. If we can explain our administration's plans to demobilize the economy, and promise to review overarching safety regulations as a part of that, we can defuse the situation. The Pragmatists argue for more immediate action, claiming that promises of reform are unlikely to sate the strikers anger. Instead they propose that we take executive action and force the mining corporations to dole out emergency hazard pay until the regulations can be addressed. While certainly effective, such an act would obviously win us few friends among the mining conglomerates."
MAF.18.a: "Promise eventual safety regulations."
MAF.18.b: "Offer immediate hazard pay."

MAF.19.t: "The West African Strikes"
MAF.19.d: "At first glance, the West African Strikes might seem to be the same story as the rest of the colony. Anger over demobilization, poor working conditions, what have become the usual reasons for worker unrest. However, a closer inspection reveals a unique element to the agitation in this region: Local relationships with the French Republic. Being far away from the loci of power, and with Nigeria being the only region remotely close to self-sufficiency, most villages in the region maintained old the supply links that trancended the border between France and Germany. Prior to the Weltkrieg these connections were not an issue, and alleviated administrative strain, and during total mobilization the problems that arose from closing the border could be ignored. But with the Economy winding down the rural areas of West Africa are chafing under our chilly relations with the French. \n\nTo the Conservative Bureaucrats, the solution is simple: unofficially tolerate cross border trade and activity. Africa has always had different rules, Kalterkrieg or not, and investing this much effort into the rural hinterlands of a relatively distant colonial region seems like a bad investment. The pragmatists disagree of course. Backed by the new guard within the administration, they say that the French have to be viewed as an enemy given the world situation, and that building the local infrastructure and networks necessary is the only way to safeguard ourselves and better protect German investments from French infulence."
MAF.19.a: "Restoring the old border agreements is the fastest and easiest option."
MAF.19.b: "The French Republic is the enemy now. We need to build new support networks."

MAF.20.t: "Debating The Budget"
MAF.20.d: "The colonial government is facing a dilemma in deciding where to allocate its resources. Some argue that austerity measures are necessary to balance the budget, while others argue that investing in various projects is the key to unlocking economic growth and development in the colony. The decision will have significant implications for the colony's future."
MAF.20.a: "We must trust our instinct - Austerity is the right path."
MAF.20.b: "Fortune favours the bold - Investment is the right path."

MAF.29.t: "Peace At Last!"

MAF.30.t: "The Right Hand Man"
MAF.30.d: "The German ambition of ruling near half a continent is no trivial feat, as evidenced by the oft ramshackle and patchy administration which presides over Mittelafrika, but perhaps more ambitious is its dream of making it profitable. No man is more familiar with this sentiment than Thyssen's rival and right hand man, Alfried Krupp. An industrialist and economist, Krupp was brought in during the tumultuous Ritter years to ostensiably fix up the flaming wreckage he had left in his wake, a role in which he quickly won favour in the bureaucracy and with Thyssen for his ability to, for lack of better words, do the dirty economic work both ruthlessly and quietly. Where once he had considered the role as only temporary, Krupp quickly began to entrench himself in the heart of the Mittelafrikan administration.\n\nThe relationship between the Governor and his chief economist is... shaky at the best of times. Even those at the lowest level of the Administration are familiar with roughly four or five of the duo's most venemous insults to one another, with heated arguments between them often exploding out of meetings into the early hours of the morning. Thyssen has regularly described Krupp as an 'empty shell of a man' whilst Krupp himself has been quoted as claiming that Thyssen is 'more comfortable with Germany being the damn servant to Africa than its ruler.'\n\nDespite this, the two seem to have a begrudging respect for each other, as both hold tremendous influence within the Conservative Bureaucrat faction, resulting in Krupp remaining firmly in his role even as the cabinet has been shuffled and reorganised half a dozen times. Naturally, this comes with its own sets of rumours and it is practically an open secret that Krupp has been positioning himself as the natural successor of Thyssen, though many question what would become of Mittelafrika with Krupp in charge and Thyssen out of the way, no longer able to restrain him..."
MAF.30.a: "Heir Apparent?"

MAF.31.t: "The Hand of the Reichspakt"
MAF.31.d: "Whilst the Mittelafrikan Bureaucracy waxes lyrical about the future of the continent and the best path for the colony, the men of the Schutztruppe and its garrisons go about the day to day duty of actually keeping it together. No man knows this better than Theodor von Hippel, the head of the Schutztruppe and de facto head of the Interventionist faction. Having served in German Africa since the First World War, von Hippel's career has been a steady, and perhaps inevitable, climb towards his current role, having served under administrations both good and bad, and eventually becoming a man so intimate with the daily running of the Schutztruppe and the intricacies of the German garrisons that it is difficult to imagine what the Mittelafrikan military would look like without him.\n\nStill, this position has put him in the unfortunate position of experiencing Mittelafrika's decline in the flesh. The years of under Ritter were the worst, yes, but that does not mean that the decline has vanished. It was plain to see in the reports from the garrisons, from the protests and strikes which had to be put down in increasing number, it was clear to see in the eyes of the German recruits, who arrived in dwindling numbers.\n\nIt was this decline that pushed him away from Thyssen's coalition of bureaucrats and administrators into the arms of likeminded individuals, the Interventionists. Mittelafrika needed drastic action to be saved and everyone knew the one man who was capable enough to carry out such an act."
MAF.31.a: "Has the Administration grown too weak?"

MAF.32.t: "Ambition in Africa"
MAF.32.d: "Joachim von Ribbentrop, born in Germany in 1893, began his career in the wine trade before joining the German army during World War I. After the war, he became involved in diplomacy, which led him via a detour in the German civil service to the murky world of Mittelafrika, an environment which he has flourished in as a supremely pragmatic and ultimately flexible chameleon.\n\nRibbentrop is known for his ability to flatter and ingratiate himself with those in power, and he uses this skill to great effect. He also has a talent for identifying opportunities for German economic and political expansion, and he was instrumental in negotiating several trade and military agreements between Mittelafrikan stakeholders.\n\nDespite his success, however, Ribbentrop's tactics are often criticized as being too aggressive and lacking in nuance, with some regarding him as a chancer who is willing to do anything to advance his own interests. Nevertheless, his career in the Mittelafrikan supercolony has helped to establish his reputation as a skilled diplomat and politician of no small ambition.\n\nHe is involved with the Berliner faction - and carries the approval of the Kaiserreich with him, despite or perhaps exactly because of his behaviour."
MAF.32.a: "I heard he's a gambling man..."

MAF.33.t: "Settling the Score"
MAF.33.d: "For the longest time now, Thyssen has been drifting away from his allies among the Conservative Bureaucrats. As his reforms grow ever stronger in the name of preserving the peace in Africa, they have begun to grow nervous, conflicts have become more common, and his dalliances with the 'other side' have become increasingly public. Finally, Thyssen has been pushed into a corner, which side shall his allegiances lay?"
MAF.33.a: "The Status Quo shall remain!"
MAF.33.b: "Mittelafrika can, and must, change!"

MAF.34.t: "The Blades Sharpen"
MAF.34.d: "What had started as an evening of light conversation at the home of a prominent Hardline socialite had, inevitably, been drawn into a prolonged conversation regarding politics. Thyssen, for all his strengths, simply could not find a manner in which he could get his conversation partner, an enthusiastic bureaucrat he had met perhaps once or twice before, to take the hint and leave him the hell alone. That was until his attention was caught by a throwaway sentence.\n\n'But when we look at Krupp's plans for the next decade...'\n\nIt was odd, as Thyssen had never been made aware of any such plans. As exhausted as he was, the wheels began to turn in his mind. Krupp had been making moves and keeping Thyssen out of them, evidently scoping out his support from the highest to the lowest levels of the administration and building a coalition of his peers. Krupp wanted the Statthaltership and Thyssen had absolutely no doubt that Krupp would do anything in his power to get it.\n\nFinally, Thyssen found the energy to move away from the bureaucrat, offering a smile and an apology before moving away. Krupp was a smart man with a sharp mind, a stalwart ally for the past decade even with their disagreements.\n\nBut if he was to ever get his hand on the Statthaltership..."
MAF.34.a: "He would destroy the continent."

MAF.35.t: "Attack on Radio Mittelafrika!"
MAF.35.d: "Whilst our intelligence services were aware of the existance of the so-called 'All-African People's Movement', or AAPM, reports into their activities had until now been dismissive, claiming that any serious attempt to unify the myriad resistance movements on the African continent would be ineffectual, 'like the others before them'. This attitude has robustly shot down today amongst scenes of blood and smoke.\n\nAt 0800 hours, a group of armed men, exact numbers still unknown, launched an assault on the Radio Mittelafrika building in Dar-es-Salaam, at the very heart of our administration. Armed with guns and explosives and after a brief shootout with nearby Askari, the men forced their way into the building and took control of the apparatus. Before our men could regain control of the situation, the leader of their group managed to launch into a volatile address to the entire colony, proclaiming the unification of the African people into a single front, and the beginning of an African War of Liberation.\n\nHow much of this rhetoric will resonate with those listening is hard to say, but Radio Mittelafrika is a vital lifeline for our administration and having it disrupted a manner is not only a shock for us, it is another in a growing list of international humiliations. Whilst Askari then quickly reestablished control over the building and duly disposed of the men responsible, the damage has in some ways already been done. Now, the only question is how do we respond? And what comes next for our great colony?"
MAF.35.a: "And now, a new chapter begins."

MAF.36.t: "Thyssen Addresses The Troops"
MAF.36.d: "The continent of Africa seems almost calm now, the brave men and women of our corps having been dispersed across the colonies, returning to their homes. They must be satisfied, knowing that they have served their nation well!\n\nSuch was the sentiment shared by all at the highest levels of the Bureaucracy in Mittelafrika, and especially by none other than Fritz Thyssen. Whilst he was under no illusions that this meant the colonies woes were fixed, it was certainly reassuring to know that this particular fire had been stamped out before it could turn into an inferno. It was time to address the colony.\n\nThus, as day turned to dusk, those who had access to a radio, or knew someone who did, tuned in tonight to hear the raspy voice of the Governor, espousing how gracious he was for the resounding success of the conscript program, how thankful he was for the bravery of those who went so far to serve Germany, and how grateful the men and women of Mittelafrika should be for the opportunity provided to them. If god willed it, perhaps there would be other opportunities for them in the future! He was certain of it.\n\nOverall, the address was a resounding success, the future was looking brighter for Mittelafrika."
MAF.36.a: "Here's to the future."

MAF.37.t: "Corruption Increases Across the Administration!"
MAF.37.d: "As the aftermath of demobilization and the ongoing 'reforms' to the Mittelafrikan administation and economy continue to play out, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Tackling corruption is not on the administration's agenda. In fact, corruption on the whole seems to have increased across the colony. It was already an open secret that power was a commodity to be bought and sold in the more remote provinces of the colony, but as of late even administrative centers such as Dar-es-Salaam or Leopoldville have become rife with corruption. Unless there's a dramatic change in course, it seems influence in the Mittelafrikan administration will go to the highest bidder."
MAF.37.a: "That was expected"

MAF.38.t: "Desertions Rampant in the Military!"
MAF.38.d: "Reports indicate a surge in desertions among the military, causing concern for the stability of the armed forces.\n\nDeserters represent not just a loss of strength to our forces but also a loss of trained men and equipment, that may be ultimately turned against us!"
MAF.38.a: "We gave them their pensions!"

MAF.39.t: "Askari Officers Desert!"
MAF.39.d: "The recent actions by the colonial administration have proven to be the boiling point in the longstanding tensions between the Mittelafrikan Military and its Askari officers. It was always known the relationship was a complicated one, as the Askari lived both as colonized subjects and as enforcers of the colonial regime. However, so long as Mittelafrika maintained their pay and pensions, and offered at least the pretense of a 'fair' administration for its subjects, the Askari could look the other way and a balance could be maintained. The recent wave of desertions among the Askari Officers hilight just how bad things have gotten in the colony. Unless something is done soon, the Mittelafrikan military will find itself that much weaker, and the AAPM that much stronger."
MAF.39.a: "I thought they were on our side!"

MAF.50.t: "First Blood Spilled"
MAF.50.d: "Dar-es-Salaam was in absolute disarray.\n\nThe news out of Madagascar had originally been bad but... passable. It was a standard affair really, or so the Governor ensured Thyssen when he had made enquiries. The local men, many of whom had served in East Asia, had been getting increasingly rowdy regarding the matter of payment, which had been worsened by local shortages. It was a similar story played a thousand times across the continent so... Thyssen hadn't the time to invest much more in the matter and had simply chosen to rely on both the local Administration and Garrison to sort the matter.\n\nRebellious grumblings transitioned into open revolt after the astonishing announcement made by the Administration that they were to be demobilised immediately. While part of the ongoing demobilisation efforts this was also done to lessen radicalism in the colony. However the soldiers who had fought on multiple continents and were still owed payment didn't take it kindly. They have now taken up arms and joined with Madagaskan freedom forces."
MAF.50.a: "We will be humiliated on the global stage!"

MAF.99.t: "A Line in the Sand"
MAF.99.d: "In the early hours of the morning, a lone vehicle made its way over the immaterial line which marked the end of German Africa and the beginning of South Africa. Despite tensions abroad, rhetoric of war between the great powers, the borders remain remarkably porous. Aboard the cramped vehicle is a journalist by the name of Fritz Apelt, carrying a bundle of papers on his lap. These papers are his life's work and, in just one short week, will guarantee that he will spend the rest of his life unable to return to his home in Germany.\n\nThough a lone patrol had spotted the vehicle and questioned the driver, a quick bribe ensures that nothing comes of this encounter. With that exchange, the vehicle slips into the distance. Abelt and his papers escape from the Reichspakt into the Accord. Within a few days, he'll be in Cape Town. Within a week, the journalist's papers will have found their way into every major publication across the world. And the purpose of these papers?"
MAF.99.a: "To pull the rotting corpse of Mittelafrika apart."

MAF.100.t: "The Rössing Dossier"
MAF.100.d: "It was perhaps inevitable that one part of the shaky Mittelafrika appartus would eventually give way. Many had predicted it for years and, until now, been brushed off.\n\nToday, they are vindicated. Appearing simultaineously in many major publications across the world, the so-called 'Rossing Dossier' has exploded into the public consciousness. An exposé into Germany's nuclear operations deep in Südwestafrika, and named for the Rossing Mines in the Namib desert, the documents reveal a culture of corruption, brutality against native workers, and administrative carelessness. Though there have been countless similar reports prior to this one, the fact that this report targets Südwestafrika, long seen as the poster child of our colony, has pushed this scandal from an embarrassment to a full-blown humiliation. No doubt it shall stick in the mind of the public longer than the other scandals shall.\n\nAlready, our administration has been left realing and officials from across the colony are scrambling to put out the fires. It is beyond certainty that the AAPM shall cease on the gruesome details of this dossier to push their radical agenda. Thankfully, our politicians at the highest level have been left untouched by the papers and, we hope, we can avoid it reaching those back home..."   
MAF.100.a: "A rotten core exposed."

MAF.101.t: "Rössing Dossier Expands!"
MAF.101.d: "At midday today, what we thought to be a complete series of documents was revealed to only be the first part of our woes. The expanded Rossing Dossier, which is currently being eaten up by a captive German audience in the homeland, has shown just how bad the situation is in the colony, and how little we are actually in control of affairs!\n\nThe further revelations contained in the Rössing Dossier are deeply concerning. It appears that there has been widespread corruption and incompetence in the administration of the colony, with officials enriching themselves at the expense of the people they were supposed to serve. Furthermore, there are reports of brutal repression of the native population, including forced labor and even massacres.\n\nThe implications of this are clear: we cannot continue to allow this state of affairs to continue. We must take decisive action to restore order and ensure that the people of the colony are treated fairly and justly. This will require a comprehensive overhaul of the colonial administration, as well as a significant investment in infrastructure and social services.\n\nThe question now is, how will the government respond to these revelations? Will they take the necessary steps to address the problems in the colony, or will they continue to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the people under their care? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the situation in the colony is dire, and urgent action is needed to set things right."
MAF.101.a: "This is not good."

MAF.102.t: "The Successors"
MAF.102.d: "It would take a fool not to realise that, at this point, Thyssen's days as Governor might be numbered. This is certainly the mood amongst the political elite of Mittelafrika where, across the continent, Governors and Corporate leaders are slowly beginning to back their candidates for the upcoming decision.\n\nFirst to make any move was Joachim von Ribbentrop, perhaps the most telltale sign that Thyssen has fallen out of favour with Berlin. Though he has much support at home, Ribbentrop has clearly been moving to shore up support in the colony itself, having spent the week hosting lavish dinner parties for a variety of guests.\n\nWith Ribbentrop making moves so boldly in the open, it did not take long for other potential candidates to realise that the race had already begun. Though there were initially a dozen names floating around, they have quickly consolidated into two obvious choices.\n\nKrupp, ever Thyssen's stalwart ally, has not made any public moves yet. However, he has also made no obvious rebuttals towards rumours of his own candidacy. To most, he seems the obvious choice and, if one were to believe the rumours, you might think he had already secured his position.\n\nTheodor von Hippel, meanwhile, has made remarks which can only be intended to market himself towards potential backers. In publicised inspections of Garrisons this week, Hippel has been keen to bring up the idea of increased funding, further support from Germany in 'any coming conflict', and how the military might play an increased role in the future of the colony.\n\nFor now, the race remains mostly shrouded from the public eye. Thyssen has made no official announcement of his resignation and has offered no comment. The future of Mittelafrika will be decided in these coming weeks, and the fate of millions of Africans will be decided by dinner parties, donations, and devious plots."
MAF.102.a: "A race in the shadows."

MAF.103.t: "Thyssen's Choice"
MAF.103.d: "Fritz Thyssen knows that his time is running out. He still has some political capital however and can at least publically state who he'd prefer to succeed him, breaking his silence on the matter of his own forthcoming resignation and the new Governor all in one burst.\n\nTheodor Hippel is a military man who believes in the power of force to solve problems. He has a reputation for being tough and uncompromising, and as Thyssen's military arm in the colony, he would be a natural choice to fight a war, but there is a question of whether this is a war that can be won by force.\n\nAlfried Krupp is a wealthy businessman who sees the colonies as a source of profit. He has a network of contacts and is known for his ability to influence politicians and officials. As Thyssen's close personal ally, he'd be a natural heir to the role, but there must be some reform and there is a question as to how far Krupp will go if it threatens his own incomes.\n\nJoachim von Ribbentrop is a diplomat who has served in several German colonies. He lacks a clear plan for dealing with the situation in the colonies, but he is seen as a skilled negotiator and mediator. Perhaps having no plan is the best plan of all, but Thyssen can't help but think the man is a slimy opportunist whose only merit is that he's in favour with Berlin. Perhaps he can turn that into something, but Thyssen shudders to think what."

MAF.200.t: "Governor Hippel Arrives"
MAF.200.d: "After a tense period of deliberation, Berlin and the Mittelafrikan Administration have made a unanimous decision to officially appoint Theodor Von Hippel as Fritz Thyssen's successor to the role of Governor of Mittelafrika. Whilst it seemed uncertain initially, Von Hippel's promises of uncompromising military action reached beyond the traditional Interventionist camp of the administration and won the full support of the Berliners, along with several key defections from other factions. Surprisingly, it was the Conservative Bureaucrats who offered the stiffest resistance, with concerns toward Von Hippel's lack of experience in the matters of Africa proving persuasive. In the end, the final decision was Berlin's and it seems they wanted a show of strength after the embarrassing Rössing Dossier.\n\nArriving in Dar-es-Salaam, the new Governor is expected to announce his cabinet shortly and many senior Berliner and Interventionist's are slated for high ranking roles. Speculation is abound and many suspect that Von Hippel's desire to focus on military matters means that large swathes of the day to day administration will be delegated.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his predecessor, Von Hippel also made a short radio address upon arrival, a broadcast which would stretch the continent. He praised Thyssen's reign, noting that it was a 'historic period for our greatest colony' but that now 'the new decade presented new challenges' and, without mentioning the Rossing Dossier directly, warned of 'plots to undo these great achievements from abroad and within' but, finally, reassured the populace that if necessary, the 'full might of the Reichspakt shall be roused to stamp out these plots'. It was a hard line and a thinly veiled threat to those foreign powers who might throw their weight behind the rebels and defectors."
MAF.200.a: "Mittelafrika will never die!"

MAF.201.t: "The War Room"
MAF.201.d: "Governor Hippel had spent only a few scant days in Berlin before immediately returning to Dar-es-Salaam. He had traded one smoke filled meeting room for another, with the sole tangible difference being the intense heat, even with all the luxuries the Governor's quarters afforded. Hippel had gathered every man who mattered in Mittelafrika to make his plans for the future clear, the room was his.\n\n\"Gentlemen. I am certain there are many of you who had hoped to see someone else in the position which I now hold. Perhaps you even saw yourself in that position.\" That drew a few laughs, \"Whatever the case, now is not the time for division. I do not take this position as a politician, or as an opportunist, but as a soldier who holds hope for only one thing; That this existential threat shall be snuffed out.\" And that drew out murmurs of approval, \"I have spent my whole life in the service of Germany and the Mittelafrikan Project and, I can say with upmost certainty, this is the gravest threat which we shall ever face.\"\n\nHe paused, facing down the assembled crowd, faces grim but nodding along to his words, \"Thus, we should not and will not shy away from this task! Ours is a mission of peace and advancement, where this so-called 'People's Movement' will only swallow the continent whole into anarchy. We must see this element of rebellion and destruction driven out! That is the sole promise I make to you, gentlemen, that I shall see it extinguished! That there shall be no shelter for the enemies of Germany! Not in our colonies, not in other colonies! If a commitment to war is the cost, then I shall pay it in full!\" He had worked himself into a fervor again, so took the moment to cool, wiping the sweat on his brow again, and cracking wise, \"Perhaps then, once the dust is settled, one of you politicians can take the helm again.\" With a slight smile, he waited for their response."

The mine has been a massive undertaking, requiring significant investment and the dedication of countless workers. The German government sees this mine as a crucial source of uranium, which is essential for their nuclear weapons program.

MAF.803.a: "Our future soon secure!"

MAF.804.t: "Rossing is Open for Business"
MAF.804.d: "The Rossing Mine in Südwestafrika is now open for business! After years of hard work and dedication, the mine is finally producing uranium ore, which is being shipped back to Germany from Swakopmund for use in their nuclear weapons program. The open pit mine is expected to be a significant source of uranium for years to come, providing Germany with the material they need to maintain their nuclear dominance."
MAF.804.a: "Excellent"

MAF.805.t: "The Rossing Mine Opens in Südwestafrika"
MAF.805.d: "A new mine has opened in our colonial possession of Südwestafrika. Located 70 kilometers from the coastal town of Swakopmund, the new mine is abuzz with activity as miners tirelessly work to extract the region's precious ore from beneath the earth. This ore is not the cause of mad mining rushes like those seen in the past for gold and silver. This rush is for the fuel that feeds atomic fire. This is the Uranium Rush. Surveys have suggested that this little corner of Afrika may hold one of the largest deposits of uranium in the world. As uranium is the key element needed for the production of atomic bombs, Berlin has demanded that we extract as much of it as possible, no matter the cost. The very future of Germany may well depend on it."
MAF.805.a: "Our nuclear dominance must be maintained!"

MAF.806.t: "The Fallout from the Rossing Dossier"
MAF.806.d: "Following the release of the expanded Rossing Dossier, there is panic within the Mittelafrikan government about the potential fallout.

The question now is whether to take action to address the revelations in the dossier or to keep calm and weather the storm."
MAF.806.a: "Take action"

MAF.807.t: "Governor Kircheim Sacked"
MAF.807.d: "In a surprise move, Dar Es Salaam has announced that Governor Kircheim of Südwestafrika has been sacked from his post, effective immediately. The announcement came following the fallout from the Rossing Dossier, which revealed serious mismanagement and corruption within the colonial administration. Many have been calling for action to be taken against Kircheim and his subordinates, and it seems that Berlin has finally listened. The question now is who will take his place and whether they will be able to address the issues that have plagued the colony for so long."
MAF.807.a: "Wonder wants this poison chalice."

MAF.808.t: "Protests in Windhuk"
MAF.808.d: "Following the revelation of the expanded Rossing Dossier, which details the exploitation and mistreatment of the local population in the colony of Südwestafrika, protests have erupted in the capital city of Windhuk. Thousands of people have taken to the streets, demanding justice and an end to the colonial rule of Germany. The protests have been largely peaceful, but tensions are high and the situation remains volatile. Security forces have been deployed to maintain order, but many fear that the situation could escalate if the demands of the protesters are not addressed."
MAF.808.a: "The situation in the colony is becoming increasingly unstable."

MAF.809.t: "Insurgent Activity on the Rise"
MAF.809.d: "Following the recent protests in Windhuk, there has been a concerning rise in insurgent activity in the region. Some of the protestors have taken up arms against the government, seeking free determination and an end to colonial rule. The insurgents have been launching attacks on government facilities and military outposts, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The government has responded with force, sending in troops to quell the rebellion. However, the situation is quickly escalating, and there are concerns that this could turn into a full-scale war if a peaceful resolution is not found soon."
MAF.809.a: "The situation in Südwestafrika is getting out of hand."

MAF.810.t: "Kircheim Resigns"
MAF.810.d: "Following the recent protests and insurgent activity in Südwestafrika, Governor Kircheim has announced his resignation from the position. In a public statement, Kircheim cited his inability to effectively manage the growing unrest and maintain the peace and stability of the colony as the reason for his resignation. He expressed his regret at not being able to better address the concerns and grievances of the people of Südwestafrika and hoped that his successor would be able to do so. The government has yet to announce who will be taking over the position of Governor."
MAF.810.a: "Oh for goodness sakes!"

MAF.811.t: "Cleaning House in Südwestafrika"
MAF.811.d: "After a period of unrest and protests in Südwestafrika, the Mittelafrikan government has decided to take action and reorganize the colonial government. Civil servants will be replaced and new roles created to address the concerns of the local population. The aim is to improve communication and create a more transparent and accountable government that serves the needs of both the local population and the German Empire."
MAF.811.a: "Rebuilding trust in our colonial administration."

MAF.812.t: "A New Südwestafrika Governor"
MAF.812.d: "Hans-Bogislav Georg Victor Graf von Schwerin-Löwitz (Hans-Bogislav von Schwerin) is an experienced administrator who has served in the colony for many years. He has served in various positions and oversaw the development of infrastructure and industry, including having more than tangential involvement in the Rossing Uranium Mine. While some criticize his policies as being too harsh towards the native population, others praise his efforts in promoting German culture and economic growth in the region."
#\n\nKarl Jung is a military commander who has served in German Southwest Africa since the first Weltkrieg. He played a prominent role in the defense of the colony against the South African invasion. Since the war, he was involved in the establishment of the National Party, a political organization that advocated for the rights of white settlers in the territory.\n\nKurt Fischer, the war ace pilot, fell in love with Südwestafrika, and never returned to Germany. He has now decided to pursue a career in politics in the colony. He is passionate about the region and its people and believes he can make a positive impact by serving as a leader. He has quickly gained a reputation as a charismatic and effective politician, and many locals begin to view him as a potential future Governor.\n\nUltimately of course, the decision lies with Dar Es Salaam."

It had left the men exhausted but, with Dar-es-Salaam so close, they had persevered. It was unfortunate then that the garrisons had found themselves a new resolve when the AAPM pushed to the limits of the city, and the fighting had devolved from the AAPM chasing the Mittelafrikan forces into a brutal melee for both sides. From street to street, door to door, the Garrisons fought for their lives. It was, at this point, a hopeless endeavour. Demoralized and exhausted, the defense collapsed after a few days.\n\nThen, at the end of these days, when it felt as if the city itself had fallen silent, the war around them dimmed for a moment of reverence. The white, black, and red of the coloniser's flag, which once flew high above the Governor's residence in the Wissmannpalatz, was pulled to the ground by the assembled men and, in its place, a tricolour of red, black, and green was raised.\n\nAfter so much suffering, they had achieved the seemingly impossible.

MAF.1019.a: "Give them trinket pensions."
MAF.1019.b: "Give them decent pensions!"

MAF.1020.t: "A Healthy Colony"
MAF.1020.d: "The government of the colony is debating where to allocate development funds to improve the well-being of its citizens. One side advocates for focusing on the rural areas, where there are limited resources and infrastructure, in order to provide better access to healthcare, education, and basic necessities. The other side argues that the urban areas need greater attention, as they are the economic and cultural centers of the colony and require investment to maintain their growth and stability."
MAF.1020.a: "Focus on rural areas."
MAF.1020.b: "Focus on the urban areas."

MAF.1021.t: "Expanding the Protections Act"
MAF.1021.d: "The colonial government has recognized the need to expand the Protections Act to cover more groups of natives and provide greater civil and legal protections to these groups. The proposed expansion includes provisions for language rights, access to education and healthcare, and protection from discrimination and exploitation. The government hopes that these measures will help to promote greater equality and social justice within the colony, and tamp down calls for more radical reform or abolition of the colonial government."
MAF.1021.a: "Let's hope it works."

MAF.1022.t: "Backlash from Protections Act"
MAF.1022.d: "Following the expansion of civil rights and protections to more natives, there has been a backlash from some white colonists who are upset that they can no longer treat natives rudely or discriminate against them. This has led to civil unrest and protests from these groups, who feel that their own rights and freedoms are being threatened. The government is now facing pressure to balance the interests of different groups within the colony."
MAF.1022.a: "Okay."

MAF.1023.t: "European Comforts"
MAF.1023.d: "The colonial government has announced that it will be providing European comforts to its citizens in the form of imported whisky, cognac, and cigars.

However the Mittelafrikan administration is the real power in the region, or so it seemed.\n\nWith the deteriorating situation within Mittelafrika they have suggested our forces could assist in the safety of this \"British\" possession.

MAF_conference.1.d: "It seems that there is not a day goes by without us being handed another defeat. All of Africa appears to be in revolt against us. Though our brave Askari and Reichspakt forces are attempting to hold the line, the mood amongst the High Command is grim. Perhaps it would be possible to force a kind of stalemate but, at best, all we can hope for is to draw the war out further and further. How long are we willing to fight in this quagmire? A decade? Perhaps two? It all seems so insurmountable.\n\nReports from the ground do not help bring hopes up either. It appears that piece by piece, the AAPM are achieving victory. Pressure on Lagos, Accra, Dar-es-Salaam, Leopoldville, all are facing the very real possibility of encroachment by AAPM forces. Each victory achieved by them weakens us on the world stage.\n\nPerhaps it is time for a change in direction?"

Our lines of communication lie scattered and broken, the infrastructure which holds the colony together have been torn apart by years of war and deliberate sabotage, some of it our own. Thousands of men have died to cowardly ambush, others have been cut down in the renewed offensives of the AAPM.\n\nDespite all of our efforts, the AAPM only seem to grow stronger and stronger by each passing day. We have not been able to make a dent in their numbers, and they have gone from guerilla warfare to outright pushes on our most valuable cities. Our generals estimate that they will be marching on Dar-es-Salaam itself within days. Morale amongst our men has plummeted, whilst the Askari abandon our cause in droves.\n\nWe must, unfortunately, now realise that our situation is looking bleak. Mittelafrika seems to be a doomed project, the only question is how we should face this reality."

MAF_conference.3.t: "Peace Summit Proposed"
MAF_conference.3.d: "Despite our desperate situation, an opportunity has arisen. As we are now keenly aware, the AAPM is not actually a singular organisation but rather a banner under which countless dozens of armed groups could operate under, a rather unique operation which has made fighting them seem an entirely thankless and pointless job. It has, however, allowed us to establish that multiple groups within the AAPM are beginning to consider peace and, more accurately, how to reasonably achieve it. Whilst this may not be the outcome we desired, it may be the only reasonable option left on the table.\n\nPressure from Berlin is mounting to end this conflict before it spirals into abject humiliation so, perhaps, it is best that we begin seeing what kind of communications we can establish with the AAPM.\n\nWhat little words we have exchanged with some of the largest groups behind the AAPM have, so far, indicated that it would not be implausible to hold a peace summit with them on neutral ground. It would certainly open up new avenues for our administration beyond those offered by this ghastly and costly war."

### NEWS EVENTS ###

MAF_news.1.t: "Theodor von Hippel Appointed Governor"
MAF_news.1.d: "With political, economic and military turmoil gripping Mittelafrika, the Kaiserreich has seen fit to appoint Theodor von Hippel as its new Governor.\n\nHaving served many years as Head of the Schutztruppe and the Interventionist Faction, von Hippel certainly has the experience and the allies to secure control over the vast apparatus of Mittelafrika. His appointment is a clear sign that a large-scale military response to the growing crises has the support of both Dar-es-Salaam and Berlin. Questions of internal reform have largely been unanswered as of yet, though many have been quick to point out that the nature of the AAPM will make a battle for Africa far more complex than a conventional war.\n\nRegardless, von Hippel's first speech to the world made clear that he would not suffer any challenge to German rule from within, or without, and that any attempt to subvert Germany's rightful place on the continent would be met with the full force of the Reichspakt."
MAF_news.1.a: "No peace in Mittelafrika yet"
MAF_news.2.t: "Alfried Krupp Appointed Governor"
MAF_news.2.d: "With a move seen as unsurprising, Germany has appointed Fritz Thyssen's long term economic advisor and prominent industrialist Alfried Krupp to the role of Governor of Mittelafrika.\n\nAs a member of the Conservative Bureaucrat faction of the Mittelafrikan administration, Alfried Krupp served alongside Thyssen for near a decade, with clashes between the two over economic and internal policy being a common sight. Now, he has taken the place of his former colleague and promised that he would build upon Thyssen's legacy.\n\nMost notably, Krupp was keen to distance himself from the more militant members of the administration, warning that Mittelafrika could not be won through military might alone. Sometimes, he remarked, the wallet is mightier than the sword. Many expect a policy of radical economic modernisation and industrialisation to be the top priority of the Krupp Administration, though some question what the ethical implications of such a plan would entail."
MAF_news.2.a: "Africa will be open for business"
MAF_news.3.t: "Joachim von Ribbentrop Appointed Governor"
MAF_news.3.d: "In a shock announcement, Joachim von Ribbentrop has been appointed Governor of Mittelafrika by the Berlin Administration.\n\nA business man and diplomat, though with little expertise in the matters of Mittelafrika, Ribbentrop evidently plied his numerous contacts in both Berlin and Mittelafrika to find himself as the de facto head of the Berliner clique and now in the highest office of the colony. With turmoil gripping Mitelafrika, Ribbentrop has wasted no time in attempting to reassure German audiences that Mittelafrika would see a drastic revitalisation in the coming years.\n\nThough many are not sure what to expect from Ribbentrop himself, the Berliner faction is well known for its ceaseless support of German hegemony on the continent and a fixation on the Germanisation of many elements of Mittelafrikan society, up to and including the Military and Economy. How sustainable these policies would be is anyone's guess but, regardless, the world might soon find out."
MAF_news.3.a: "Germany's grip on Africa tightens"
MAF_news.4.t: "Rössing Dossier Leaked"
MAF_news.4.d: "German hegemony over the African continent has been irrevocably shaken today with the release of the so-called Rössing Dossier to domestic and international audiences. The papers, named for the Uranium mines opened recently in Südwestafrika, excruciatingly detail the horrific working conditions found across the colony and the casual systems of abuse, corruption, and mismanagement which enable them to exist. The Dossier pays special attention to the namesake mines, underlining how their rapid development and expansion were fuelled by slavery in all but name and violence by local garrisons. The authors, who have remained anonymous, made certain to draw the link between the situation on the ground and key actors at the very top of the administration.\n\nNaturally, the response to these papers have been explosive, both inside the colony and abroad. In Germany, which sought to contain the papers, the dossier has shattered the carefully constructed image of Mittelafrika in the eye of the public, making many wonder if the colony can even survive."
MAF_news.4.a: "The end of the Thyssen Era?"
MAF_news.5.t: "Formation of the AAPM"
MAF_news.5.d: "In the latest of a series of embarrassing developments for Germany, it appears that African resistance to their rule has coalesced into a united front. Though details on the new group are scarce, it is understood that the group is united in a desire for the 'decolonisation' of the entirety of Mittelafrika and the end of German rule, to be achieved through violence if necessary. Whilst Governor Fritz Thyssen has dismissed the claims as 'nonsense' and a 'fabrication', the creation of this 'All-African People's Movement' is sure to complicate matters for the Kaiserreich.\n\nIt is understood that the AAPM draws support from every side of the political spectrum, with nationalists, republicans, liberals and conservatives, even syndicalists and monarchists giving their support for the movement. The goal of the movement, as of yet, remains unclear. Some claim it is simply a means to an end to force German decolonisation. Others claim the movement has greater amibitions."
MAF_news.5.a: "It can't last, surely?"
MAF_news.5.b: "Our patience is wearing thin, Herr Thyssen..."
MAF_news.6.t: "AAPM Declares Total Victory"
MAF_news.6.d: "A shocked world set its eyes on the besieged city of Dar-es-Salaam today as the forces of the All African People's Movement finally broke through the remnants of the German defenses and captured the capital of its greatest colony. Having waged a brutal and prolonged guerilla war against the garrisons and forces of the Reichspakt, the commander of the AAPM forces took to the balcony where once the Governor would've stood and addressed the celebrating forces below claiming that 'whatever came next, Africa would never bow again.'\n\nThe future of the AAPM as it stands is unclear, some expect that now the broad coalition has served its purpose, it will be dissolved into independent republics and kingdoms. Others, however, point to the growing power of the group's pan-african wing who, currently, seem ascendant. What little remains of the German's forces have been scrambled together in Südwestafrika, the sole remaining area of colonial influence, where there have been reports of staggering amounts of refugees and political chaos."
MAF_news.6.a: "Masters of their own fate"
MAF_news.7.t: "The End of Mittelafrika"
MAF_news.7.d: "After an arduous and painstakingly complex process, the tense negotiations between Germany and the All African People's Movement have drawn to a close and put an end to the decade long conflict which has bloodied the continent. Though many in the Kaiserreich will be bitterly disappointed with the result, Governor von Hippel hailed the outcome as a victory for Germany, claiming that the treaties agreed would ensure that German interests were properly interested in the region, especially in regards to its former 'core' colonies.\n\nGerman influence in the rest of Africa, meanwhile, has largely begun to collapse and opened a power vacuum, one which the AAPM is woefully underequipped to handle. There is no doubt that the movement's legacy on the continent will be immeasurable but unity within the organisation has rapidly begun to disintegrate. Observers have claimed that this heralds the beginning of a new diplomatic scramble on the continent, as new states may soon forget old grudges towards the Reichspakt when push comes to shove..."

MAF_news.8.t: "Africa Plunged Into Chaos"
MAF_news.8.d: "Negotiations between the All African People's Movement and Germany have drawn to a close, with both sides exiting with little to claim victory over. Whilst Germany entered with hopes of retaining significant influence over its former colonies, it was in no position to influence the proceedings. With both the administration and the military devastated by years of decline, Germany was forced to concede near every point. The AAPM, on the other hand, has lost all pretenses of unity, with low-level conflict erupting between provisional states during the negotiations.\n\nThe only real winner appears to be the dozens of petty warlords which have sprung up over the continent, who now stand to earn innumerable riches in the coming days.\n\nStatthalter Krupp, meanwhile, made only a short statement, claiming that he was 'looking forward to being back in Berlin.' For the moment, it looks as if he will avoid all reprisal."
MAF_news.8.a: "Generations will feel the effects of this."
MAF_news.9.t: "Reichspakt claims hegemony over Africa"
MAF_news.9.d: "The world watches in disbelief as negotiations between Germany and the AAPM drew to a close today, with an unbelievable victory for the Kaiserreich was announced. All of the states of the former Mittelafrika area would be granted independence but remain within the Reichspakt. How the fervently anti-German organisation came to accept an utter surrender to German influence is of yet unknown but already people have begun to claim the outcome was masterminded by Governor Joachim Ribbentrop.\n\nWhilst Ribbentrop launched into a fiery and triumphant speech to the German crowds at home, critics have already begun to point at his methods as astonishingly brutal. It appears that Ribbentrop managed to effectively disassemble the AAPM from within, with assassination and bribery, whilst preparing the colony for decolonisation, stacking its inner committee with pragmatic strongmen who would accept Reichspakt membership in exchange for high-ranking roles in the new African states."

MAF_wars_end: "Thyssen's Return"
MAF_wars_end_desc: "With the war in Europe wrapping up and the war in the East at an impasse, Governor Thyssen has been engaged in a flurry of meetings with the top men of German politics. Though we know not what was discussed yet, it is certain that our path for the forseeable future was agreed in those rooms. We can only await Thyssen's return..."
MAF_trouble_begins: "The Task Ahead"
MAF_trouble_begins_desc: "The work ends not with the war, there is a extensive list of tasks which need to be addressed immediately; Most notable is the challenge of demobilisation. Handling the disarmament of our colonial forces and a wind down of our war economy will require careful logistical planning."
MAF_fresh_mandate: "A Fresh Mandate"
MAF_fresh_mandate_desc: "Thyssen's return from Berlin has dismissed any unsubstantiated rumours of his removal and instead reaffirmed his authority. It also marks the end of one era, the Era of the Weltkrieg, and the beginning of a new, postwar period. The Governor is keen to have this distinction clear for all to see in their actions and their policy, the time for war is over! Now is the time for reconstruction and reconciliation!"
MAF_clean_cabinet: "Clean Out The Cabinet"
MAF_clean_cabinet_desc: "The end of the war means a new era must begin. Whilst we are grateful to the allies who helped us during the war, the influx of potential new allies following its conclusion means Thyssen needs not rely on them any longer."
MAF_administration_allies: "Renew Administration Alliances"
MAF_administration_allies_desc: "Thyssen's mass reforms during the war, popular amongst some and deeply unpopular amongst other members of the Mittelafrikan administration, mean the Governor has expended a lot of political favours to ensure their success. We must make sure we can rely on our allies should push come to shove."
MAF_draw_budget: "Draw Up A Budget"
MAF_draw_budget_desc: "The end of the war means we must decide the direction in which we want to take our greatest colony. The administration, once again, is neatly split between those who argue that a path of strict austerity must be followed and those who argue that a policy of massive investment will be the best possible path long term."
MAF_demobilise_economy: "Demobilise the Economy"
MAF_demobilise_economy_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg saw our nation's economy fully mobilised for war, all sectors of the economy no matter what they were were fully committed to the war. But with the Weltkrieg over and won its high time to cease wartime production and controls, returning the economy to a peacetime one."
MAF_demobilise_men: "Release the Conscripts"
MAF_demobilise_men_desc: "We can't keep the men mobilised and ready to fight an enemy that has been vanquished any longer. For our nation to return to peacetime the men must also be returned to their peacetime roles and jobs. Their service to the nation is finally over."
MAF_demobilise_guns: "Reclaim Service Weapons"
MAF_demobilise_guns_desc: "With the return of the men from Europe, they also bring back with them their guns and other equipment. While many would like to keep their service rifles as a memento of their service, many also wish to take their guns back for less reasonable purposes. So to ensure that our own guns won't be turned back on us, we will begin the deactivation and re-stockpiling of these guns into reserves."
MAF_honour_men: "Honour The Men Of Afrika!"
MAF_honour_men_desc: "Though difficult tasks lay ahead of us, demobilisation has been a success. We should not spend our time dwelling on the troubles of the future but celebrating our victories of the present. Our men of Afrika conquered the horrors of the 2nd Weltkrieg and they should be honoured as the heroes they are!"

MAF_austerity_path: "Trimming the Fat"
MAF_austerity_path_desc: "The bloated bureaucracy and social programs it has spawned are a needless drain on what could be an exceedingly productive colony. It's time to end excess and trim the fat."
MAF_austerity_path_tt: "Going down the §YAusterity§! route will have §Gshort term rewards§!, and appease members of the §YAdministration§! and §YBerliner§! faction."
MAF_conscript_jobs: "Jobs For Conscripts"
MAF_conscript_jobs_desc: "We should oversee the creation of work for veterans of the war. This will keep them out of trouble, and avoid them forming associations with potentially dangerous individuals."
MAF_export_infrastructure: "New Export Infrastructure"
MAF_export_infrastructure_desc: "The vast mineral wealth of Mittelafrika is nothing if it is trapped within the interior of the continent. Roads, railways, ports and so on must all be built to allow extraction to be conducted in a forthright and profitable manner."
MAF_focus_traditional_profits: "Focus on Traditional Profits"
MAF_focus_traditional_profits_desc: "Cash crops such as cocaa and rubber as well as minerals rare or otherwise have been the core of Mittelafrika's viability as an economic enterprise. Renewing our focus on these traditional profits will serve us well."
MAF_encourage_zivilisiert: "Encouraging the 'Zivilisiert'"
MAF_encourage_zivilisiert_desc: "There are those natives who honestly believe in the advantage and intellect of their masters. These civilised individuals should be encouraged and supported. They will be the future of the colony and demonstrate the success of our civilising mission. It does us no good to discriminate against the native who knows how to conduct himself in the manner of his betters."
MAF_empower_three_pillars: "Empowering the Three Pillars"
MAF_empower_three_pillars_desc: "The Three Pillars of Mittelafrikan success have been the Schutztruppe in West and South West Africa, the Belgian Corporate Interests in Kongo and the Anglo-farmer-settlers in East Africa. We might wish more Germans were here to hold the helm but we must work with what we have. By empowering these pillars of our previous success, we can assure that the colony will continue into the future."
MAF_impose_european_economy: "Imposing A European Economy"
MAF_impose_european_economy_desc: "Taking payment in corvee labor, barter or other fungible, but non-monetary goods must come to an end. If we cannot keep track of the budgetary requirements and constraints of the colony, we will not be able to understand how to exploit it. A European style, money-centred economy is needed, now!"

MAF_manpower_question: "Solving The Manpower Question"
MAF_manpower_question_desc: "The eternal problem is finding enough reliable men in order to manage this great unwieldy beast of a colony. Whilst the land overflows with natives, they cannot be trusted to not turn on their masters. Instead we draw from small pools of talent from European and European-descendants. Perhaps we need to re-consider the role of those civilised natives who have started popping up."
MAF_bureaucratic_consolidation: "A Bureaucratic Consolidation"
MAF_bureaucratic_consolidation_desc: "Consolidation of the Bureaucracy will resolve many issues - the vast network of officers, managers, governors, clerks and chief clerks can be reduced somewhat. By forcing them into more centralised locations, covering greater geographical areas, we can at least reduce running costs and enforce greater efficiencies."
MAF_new_native_roles: "New Native Roles"
MAF_new_native_roles_desc: "The civilised natives who exist stand as a greatly underutilised resource. By relaxing requirements on who can hold which rank and title, we will be able to devolve the administration work of the colony onto the colonised, and save ourselves from struggling to fill posts with European talent."
MAF_garrison_assessment: "Garrison Assessment"
MAF_garrison_assessment_desc: "The manner in which the colony is garrisoned could perhaps be optimised. We should investigate if there are efficiencies to be found in reducing, or relocating our garrisons. It is plausible entirely that we have overgarrisoned some regions for historical reasons that no longer apply."

MAF_conduct_census: "The [GetYear] Census"
MAF_conduct_census_desc: "One cannot make an accurate record of taxation without knowing the number of individuals to be taxed. It is a simple requirement of any modern state that a census is conducted, that we might gain an idea of how many people live upon the land."
MAF_settler_propaganda: "A Home In Mittelafrika!"
MAF_settler_propaganda_desc: "By attracting more Europeans in general and more Germans specifically to Mittelafrika we will ease the difficulties we see in managing the colony. This is a land of great opportunity for our compatriots, we must remind them of this.\n\nWhy suffer the cold and damp of Europe, when you can live in Germany's place in the Sun like a King?"
MAF_new_german_man: "For The German Man"
MAF_new_german_man_desc: "The German is a hardy, industrious man, but he could be stronger, braver and tougher. Tempered by living on the savage frontier, the German man can be a new adventurer as he helps to uplift the darkest continent into the Atomic age."
MAF_made_in_mittelafrika: "For The German Industry"
MAF_made_in_mittelafrika_desc: "The vast factories of the Ruhr and Silesia cry out for more, more, more materials. Mittelafrika will answer them without a doubt, but she can also make her own goods. The German industry can stand to gain from making things in Mittelafrika, and sparing herself the energy of shipping it all to Europe and back."
MAF_finish_rossing_mine: "Expand The Rossing Mine"
MAF_finish_rossing_mine_desc: "The Rossing Mine is the jewel in Mittelafrika's crown. As such the expansion of the mine will provide the entire colony with increased wealth, prosperity and even international prestige, at such a well ran, vast operation."

MAF_opening_bureaucracy: "Opening the Bureaucracy"
MAF_opening_bureaucracy_desc: "The stifling restrictions on who can work for the bureaucracy have made it sluggish and slow, as well as struggling to replace members when they inevitably retire or quit. We need to open it up, reducing entry requirements and allowing civilised natives to perform lower-level tasks in order to revitalise the organisation."
MAF_import_reichspakt_experts: "Import Reichspakt Experts"
MAF_import_reichspakt_experts_desc: "Some things cannot be taught quickly, some things cannot be taught at all, since this dark continent lacks even universities. As such we should priorities and incentivise the immigration of experts from Reichspakt countries via generous pay packets and opportunities to work in their field out here."
MAF_involving_the_protectorates: "Involve the Protectorates"
MAF_involving_the_protectorates_desc: "Any true development of the continent will require the involvement of the tribal kings and leaders in the Protectorates. These people are socially conservative and are helpful in that their submission spared us bloody wars to incorporate them historically, but they must recognise they too live in the modern era."
MAF_top_to_bottom_reform: "Top To Bottom Reform"
MAF_top_to_bottom_reform_desc: "From root to branch, the colony is sick. If we are to save her, we will require a through and indeed complete reform of how things are ran around her. We must take a broom to corruption and patronage and sweep it out. Otherwise this place will never succeed."

MAF_expand_health_infrastructure: "Expanding Health Infrastructure"
MAF_expand_health_infrastructure_desc: "In some parts of the colony a single doctor takes care of a region the size of Belgium. This cannot continue!\n\nWe must expand the infrastructure for healthcare, to take care of natives and Europeans alike so that we might avoid losses of life to disease and distemper that could otherwise have been avoided by a simple vaccine or pill."
MAF_native_protections: "Expanding the Native Protection Act"
MAF_native_protections_desc: "The rights of the natives were set out in the native protection act, but frankly this piece of legislature is outmoded and has such regressive clauses as requiring five natives stand witness to one European committing a crime. This has lead to all kinds of violent and barbaric acts, unfortunately on the part of our countrymen, because they are able to suppress or remove witnesses, or simply catch their victims alone.\n\nThe Natives must be better protected, and the number of witnesses for a prosecution to be launched will be reduced."
MAF_focus_cities: "Focus on the Cities"
MAF_focus_cities_desc: "Urbanism has been proven to be the driver of advancement in Europe. So too will it be in Africa. It also helps that it is simpler to develop and expand the cities where we have much more control and visibility of what is ongoing."
MAF_power_cities: "Powering The Cities"
MAF_power_cities_desc: "With the expansion of powerplants in and around the cities, we will be able to light them and provide electricity to the houses of people.\n\nNo longer, the Darkest Continent!"
MAF_public_works: "The Public Works Program"
MAF_public_works_desc: "All great things have been made from the sweat off people's backs. So too will be Mittelafrika. A new public works program to build sanitation, transport and electrical infrastructure will make Mittelafrika great."
MAF_opening_interior: "Open The Interior"
MAF_opening_interior_desc: "The great interior of Africa, her vast and endless plains and jungles, her hills and mountains. All must be connected into the ever growing global web of the German dream. Roads must be built, railways laid, lost cities found and uncontacted tribes contacted. Order must be brought across the land."
MAF_favour_the_core_colonies: "Favour Our Own"
MAF_favour_the_core_colonies_desc: "Some colonies in Mittelafrika were always German. We should take care of them the most, use them as models, and bring them up into the future as leaders among the Mittelafrikans."
MAF_raise_the_continent: "Raise The Continent"
MAF_raise_the_continent_desc: "All of Mittelafrika is our responsibility. We will bring her up as one great whole, unbridled and strong into the future, a partner to Germany that will be unstoppable!"


MAF_investment_path: "New Era, New Budget"
MAF_investment_path_desc: "With the dawn of the new era under Governor [MAF.GetLeader], a re-evaluation of the financial plans for the colony must be done in order to ensure the great work is undertaken in the proper manner."
MAF_invest_path_tt: "§YMassive Investments§! will §Rdamage§! our popularity in exchange for §Rhigher risk, non-immediate§! §Gstrong rewarding long-term benefits§! for our §YEconomy§! and §YAdministration.§!"
MAF_veterans_pay: "Pensions for Veterans"
MAF_veterans_pay_desc: "Despite their humble origins and uncouth manner, many natives fought for Germany, or provided ancillary support such as logistics or stretcher bearing during the Weltkrieg. We should not snub them merely for the colour of their skin or their primitive upbringings. Our veterans deserve pensions, regardless of the details, surely?"

MAF_whirlwind_tour: "Tour The Continent!"
MAF_whirlwind_tour_desc: "How can one see what is going on from an office in Dar Es Salaam? One cannot. No, it must be seen with one's own eyes. So the Governor has decreed. Fuel the plane, he will be touring the colony to best understand it's workings by seeing them for himself."
MAF_sudwestafrika_tour: "The Deserts of Südwestafrika"
MAF_sudwestafrika_tour_desc: "The arid South West of the continent, a model of German colonial policy in the face of adversity and the scene of a bloody war against the Herero and Nama people some thirty years ago. There is a peace there now, but it is an uneasy one still after all these years.\n\nNonetheless there are lessons to be learnt here, even if it is that sometime the whiphand must not be stayed."
MAF_kameroon_tour: "The Bastion of West Afrika"
MAF_kameroon_tour_desc: "Kamerun has been German for so long, the natives there could be mistaken for Mecklenburgers, if you closed your eyes. The plantations here spread as far as the eye can see, and the Duala people work in corvee to keep them producing the cocoa and bananas that Germany adores.\n\nA prosperous land, one that surely has nothing bubbling away under that calm surface?"
MAF_tanganyika_tour: "The Heart of the Administration"
MAF_tanganyika_tour_desc: "Ostafrika is the beating heart of the administration, from the vast city of Dar-Es-Salaam a continent recieves it's marching orders. A beautiful land of farms and wild savannah full of big game, the territory still bears the scars of Von Gotzen's crushing of the Maji Maji rebellion in 1907.\n\nEven more than forty years later, the strength of German will against native opposition is demonstrated here."
MAF_crownlands_tour: "The Former Crownlands"
MAF_crownlands_tour_desc: "The Great Lakes are one of the most populous places on the planet. This means that the crownlands are a valuable resource in terms of labour and that the tribespeople there are willing to work for Mittelafrikan glory serves to advance the goals of the Governor and of Germany.\n\n Perhaps the lesson here is that the Monarchs of the peoples there are worthy of treating with, if not as equals then as trusted subordinates?"
MAF_corporate_tour: "The Corporate Domains"
MAF_corporate_tour_desc: "The heart of darkness, that is what that Polish schwein Conrad called the Kongo. Since the deposition of the Leopoldine regime and the replacement of Belgian government by that of Mittelafrika, unfortunately not much has changed. From Kamerun in the north to Katanga in the south, the Force Publique under the auspices of the Corporations such as Union Minière du Haut-Katanga maintains a state of ~admittedly productive~ terror in the province.\n\nPerhaps there are lessons to be learned from this too?"
MAF_protectorates_chosen: "Lean on Protectorates"
MAF_protectorates_chosen_desc: "The Protectorates - the crown lands - are a valuable asset, their manpower and ability to manage the restive native populations are too invaluable to ignore. We must give them greater assistance and leeway if we are to maintain this colony."
MAF_corporations_chosen: "Lean on Corporations"
MAF_corporations_chosen_desc: "The Corporations have, despite their brutal methods, shown that the native cannot be trusted but he can be made to work himself down to a nub. We must support them in their ventures so they might support us in ours."
MAF_award_privileges: "Award New Privileges"
MAF_award_privileges_desc: "The monarchs and chieftains have always rankled at being third-rate at best under the regime of Mittelafrika, despite their value to us. We will allow them more privileges, let them have their old ways of bigamy and so forth, so that they might be happier in our service."
MAF_generous_contracts: "Award Generous Contracts"
MAF_generous_contracts_desc: "How do you motivate a capitalist? By offering him an opportunity of course. And the more incentivised the corporations are, the easier the running of the colony will become, because it will be their business, as well as ours."

### SCHUTZTRUPPE TREE ###

MAF_rationalise_the_high_command: "Rationalise the High Command"
MAF_rationalise_the_high_command_desc: "The current state of our high command is a very sorry one. The commanders and generals rarely meet to discuss tactics and issues, as they are dispersed throughout the continent dealing with issues in their zones. With insurgent activities picking up in recent years we need to have better control over our armed forces to deal with any foes quickly, externally or internally. Therefore the high command shall undergo a process of greater streamlining and centralisation to improve their ability to command and react with the armed forces to any threats."
MAF_continue_motorisation_efforts: "Continue Motorisation Efforts"
MAF_continue_motorisation_efforts_desc: "Despite the efforts to motorise our army during the recent conflict, a large proportion of our army still relies on horse and cart or marching to reach operation areas. As the need for army units to quickly react to any insurgent uprisings or border conflicts, we should not rely on these outdated methods anymore. \n\nWith this in mind, the government has put in a large request for surplus army trucks from Berlin, finally bringing our troops into the modern age."
MAF_secure_heer_reinforcements: "Secure Heer Reinforcements"
MAF_secure_heer_reinforcements_desc: "Our reserves of troops are starting to get dangerously low. We should immediately contact Berlin and request Heer reinforcements to ensure we have ample reserves ready in case of further action."
MAF_maintain_contracts_with_mauser: "Maintain Contracts with Mauser"
MAF_maintain_contracts_with_mauser_desc: "For years now Mauser has been our primary producer of small arms for our nation's armed forces. However, as the need to replace and upgrade our weapons comes, we need a steady flow of arms coming from them to keep our troops fighting. Thus it's high time we renew and upgrade the arms contracts with them to keep the flow of arms coming and potentially expand it."
MAF_overhaul_supply_lines: "Overhaul Supply Lines"
MAF_overhaul_supply_lines_desc: "It's one thing to have a means of supplying logistics to the front, it's another to have a path to get those logistics there. Here in Africa, unfortunately, railways and roads don't go everywhere where we are needed. But with the recent uptick in insurgent activity, certain areas of Africa are prone to insurgent uprisings in the areas where we do not have the means of supplying men. \n\nSo to help quell these uprisings quickly, plans for new regional supply hubs and infrastructure improvements have been forwarded, so we may have a steady flow of supply should our men have to react to an uprising."
MAF_developing_fortress_busting_techniques: "Develop Fortress-Busting Techniques"
MAF_developing_fortress_busting_techniques_desc: "Recently our men have been encountering more prepared and dug-in insurgent forces. This is making removing these pests even harder for our troops, who lack sufficient equipment and training for dealing with fortified positions. Thus, a proposal by the high command to send some of our generals and officers to Berlin to train with Heer veterans and advisors in fortress-busting techniques learnt from the past two Weltkriegs, then to come back and apply them here in Africa."
MAF_integrate_paratroopers: "Integrate Gericke's Fallschirmjäger"
MAF_integrate_paratroopers_desc: "A disciple of Kurt Student, Walter Gericke has spent several years in Ostafrika, refining his Fallschirmjäger's doctrine in the remote regions of the continent with extremely promising results: Their ability to drop amongst partisan groups and cause havoc has been noted by both Hippel and Schorner.\n\nIt is high time to formalise the Fallschirmjäger's position within the Schutztruppe, to increase the effectiveness of our security operations."
MAF_perfect_bandit_fighting: "Perfect Bandenbekämpfung"
MAF_perfect_bandit_fighting_desc: "For our armed forces to be able to quell any rebellion, band of tribals or troublemaking bandits, we can no longer rely on technological supremacy or overwhelming numbers of men to secure superiority. Instead we will 'strike such terror into the population that they lose any will to resist'.\n\nIf these bandits want a war, we will give them one."
MAF_doctrine_improvement: "[MAF.GetLeader] Doctrine"
MAF_doctrine_improvement_desc: "At the moment our army trains in European army doctrines for European-style warfare. But the issue with this is well, we're not in Europe. Effectively making tactics learnt by most of our armed forces useless in counter-insurgency, guerrilla warfare and the general style of African warfare. With this in mind and lessons learnt from countless years of African conflicts, it's time to begin drafting doctrines and strategies unique to African warfare for our army to train in."
MAF_lionise_the_african_divisions: "Lionise the Afrikanische Divisionen"
MAF_lionise_the_african_divisions_desc: "Men from the Afrikanische Divisionen served with distinction during the Second Weltkrieg for the Kaiser. Hardened by the African sun, they proved resilient even against the most determined International invader. To help with recruitment drives, we should lionise these men and their actions as heroes and inspiration for all men to strive for."
MAF_a_question_of_mercenaries: "A Question of Mercenaries"
MAF_a_question_of_mercenaries_desc: "To help with policing actions and conflicts against insurgents, our government for years has relied upon groups of mercenaries to help aid and control our untamed frontier. But this comes with the issue of lack of control and discipline over these men of fortune, who can act freely in their own \"interests\" while not worrying about the repercussions of their \"actions\". However, with the recent reforms of our Schutztruppe squads to be better capable of acting against pockets of unrest, the possibility of finally being rid of these less-than-savoury groups and having more government control over our frontiers has been brought forward.\n\nThus it has been put forward to the government, should we continue in this practise, or use our regular troops for it?."
MAF_promote_coloured_commanders: "Promote Coloured Commanders?"
MAF_promote_coloured_commanders_desc: "Coloured men and officers have proved their worth to the Kaiser time and time again. Yet current restrictions prevent these men from attaining a higher rank than a commander. We should finally repay our debts to these men of Africa and remove these racial restrictions, promoting them to generals as equals with our European generals in our army. Also aiding public perception of our armed forces in Africa as a sign of Africans being equals to even our most decorated generals."
MAF_expand_african_air_army: "Expand the Afrikanische Luftarmee"
MAF_expand_african_air_army_desc: "As airpower has shown its value in aiding troops in suppressing rebellions and uprisings, we should look to expand our Afrikanische Luftarmee. Its value in aiding troops' attacks upon insurgent positions has been vital in recent years. As the future looks to be rife with an insurgent activity, we should exploit this advantage by expanding this branch."
MAF_pioneer_napalm_munitions: "Pioneer \"Napalm\" Munitions"
MAF_pioneer_napalm_munitions_desc: "Jointly developed by a team of American and German scientists within the American Union State during the last stages of the Second American Civil War, 'Napalm' is a brutally effective incendiary munition that can lay waste to whole landscapes that has grown extremely interesting to Schutztruppe commanders.\n\nFor some time, they've been advocating for the Luftarmee to adopt Napalm munitions in bombing campaigns against the AAPM and other assorted rebel groups. Lets see just how effective the vaunted petrochemical really is, as a terror weapon, and in clearing out their hidey holes."
MAF_train_new_bomber_wings: "Train New Bomber Wings"
MAF_train_new_bomber_wings_desc: "One of the joys of Mittleafrika is the lack of enemy anti-air. With this, our bomber force has the luxury of being able to accurately attack enemy positions, even from lower altitudes with little risk of being shot down. And as the value of these bomber formations against stuborn insurgent strongholds is realised an expansion of the current bomber wings is on the cards."
MAF_flatten_the_jungle: "Flatten the Jungle!"
MAF_flatten_the_jungle_desc: "With the power of napalm and new bomber wings, no insurgent is safe from an attack from Afrikanische Luftarmee. Not even the thickest jungle is safe from aerial attack. All that's needed is a rough location and the bombers will quite literally flatten the jungle, denying them any natural protection from our forces.\n\nFor the enemy, There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide."
MAF_rotorcraft: "Rotorcraft?"
MAF_rotorcraft_desc: "Reports of the use and development of rotorcraft present us with a potential new tool in the fight in the Bush War, with these vehicles providing a potential platform for assaulting the insurgents as well as moving much needed supplies without having to traverse rough terrain or hack down jungles to lay roads or rails."

### GOVERNOR HIPPEL TREE ###
MAF_Hippel_intro_focus: "Governor von Hippel"
MAF_Hippel_intro_focus_desc: "Theodor von Hippel, a clean broom with which to sweep the house of Mittelafrika, has arrived. Now the first twenty one days of his tenure have passed and he already has some thoughts about how to proceed."
MAF_Hippel_stack_cabinet: "Stack the Cabinet"
MAF_Hippel_stack_cabinet_desc: "The cabinet is divided. This impacts the ability of the leadership to take decisive action in a timely fashion. The solution - remove the dissenters. Those who cannot be removed, will be overwhelmed and outnumbered."
MAF_Hippel_reach_across: "Reach Across Divides"
MAF_Hippel_reach_across_desc: "If we are going to succeed in this mission, we must work together as a team. Our previous issues must be overlooked, and a team approach is more important than complete agreement on all matters."
MAF_Hippel_empower_statthalter: "Empower The Governor"
MAF_Hippel_empower_statthalter_desc: "One man, one vision, one Mittelafrika.\n\nWith von Hippel in the lead, the Governor must be able to make sweeping decisions on the information he has available immediately, without rubberstamps or second guessing."
MAF_Hippel_rule_compromise: "The Rule of Compromise"
MAF_Hippel_rule_compromise_desc: "One man can do much, but he cannot hold everything in his mind at once.\n\nWith von Hippel in the lead, the Governor must have the support and advice of his team, giving him assistance and insight on matters so he doesn't make snap judgements that might backfire."
MAF_Hippel_military_oversight: "Solidify Military Oversight"
MAF_Hippel_military_oversight_desc: "The Schutztruppe are like dogs with too long a leash. They jerk and pull at their chains and sometimes you wonder if you released them, just how far they'll go. No more.\n\nWhilst the Governor is a civilian title, Marshal von Hippel is also a serving German Army officer. These colonial troops will learn to click their heels and salute just as their brothers in Europe do."
MAF_Hippel_maintain_seperation: "Maintain The Separation"
MAF_Hippel_maintain_seperation_desc: "It is not wise to conflate too much power in one man's hands. Whilst Governor von Hippel has military experience, there are only so many hours in the day, and he cannot be expected to do everything."
MAF_Hippel_end_leaks: "Ending The Leaks"
MAF_Hippel_end_leaks_desc: "These damnable journalists, investigators and snoops are the bane of the colony. Ratting out the finks who are feeding them information will prove beneficial, and we will need to winnow those snivelling rats from our ranks so we can proceed with operational secrecy."
MAF_Hippel_first_wave: "Bring in the First Wave"
MAF_Hippel_first_wave_desc: "Reinforcements will be the key to our maintaining our grip on the increasingly restless colony. The first wave have been prepared for some time in Germany, and now we will call for them to arrive, so that we might start to assuage the issues we are facing."
MAF_Hippel_understand_AAPM: "Understanding the AAPM"
MAF_Hippel_understand_AAPM_desc: "'If the wars of civilised people are less cruel and destructive than those of savages, the difference arises from the social condition both of states in themselves and in their relations to each other. Out of this social condition and its relations war arises, and by it war is subjected to conditions, is controlled and modified. But these things do not belong to war itself; they are only given conditions; and to introduce into the philosophy of war itself a principle of moderation would be an absurdity.' \n- Von Clausewitz."
MAF_Hippel_war_begins: "The War For Afrika"
MAF_Hippel_war_begins_desc: "The undertaking of Mittelafrika can no longer be misrepresented. \n\nIt is a war for the very heart and soul of the colony. A war against the ungreatful, unwashed masses who would drag the continent back to the barbarism of the time before Western civilisation. A war that cannot be lost, or Germany is lost, for she has poured her heart and soul into lifting these people up, and they turn their backs on her."

### GOVERNOR RKAUPP TREE ###
MAF_Krupp_intro_focus: "Governor Krupp"
MAF_Krupp_intro_focus_desc: "Alfried Krupp has finally ascended to power in Mittelafrika after his former ally Fritz Thyssen was removed by Berlin. Krupp, a powerful industrialist, had previously supported Thyssen in his efforts to maintain a strong foothold in the colony's lucrative resource industry, for ten long years.\n\nHowever, after Thyssen's fall from grace, Krupp stepped in to fill the power vacuum, using his wealth and influence to establish himself as a key figure in the colony's political and economic landscape.\n\nThis shift in power has already started to have far-reaching consequences for the colony's native population, as Krupp's known plans are marked by a ruthless pursuit of profit and a disregard for human rights."
MAF_Krupp_host_allies: "Host the Allies of Mittelafrika"
MAF_Krupp_host_allies_desc: "To achieve his goals, Krupp is focused on building alliances and securing support from powerful players in Europe and beyond. He recognizes that Mittelafrika's success is inextricably linked to the economic and political stability of the region, and he believes that hosting allies is a crucial first step in achieving this. While Krupp faces opposition from some quarters, he is determined to lead Mittelafrika into a new era of prosperity and strength."

MAF_AAPM_dawn_africa: "A New Dawn For Africa!"
MAF_AAPM_dawn_africa_desc: "Victory!\nWhere once the German flag flew, now we hoist the tricolour of Africa. Victory, however, is just the beginning. Already the debates have begun on the future of our forces and the entire movement. What place should the AAPM have now that Africa is free? What will be the new face of Africa? All these questions and more we shall answer with enthusiasm! For now we can decide our own future!"
MAF_AAPM_new_armed_forces: "Organise The Armed Wings"
MAF_AAPM_new_armed_forces_desc: "Whilst the politicians are the voice of the African People, the Armed Forces of the AAPM are their fist. The nature of the war means that our armed forces have largely been decentralised groups suited towards asymmetrical warfare. Now that we have won our battle, our forces should reflect this as a professional army, not an unruly mob."
MAF_AAPM_accra_group: "The Accra Group Ascendant"
MAF_AAPM_accra_group_desc: "Whilst the AAPM is divided into a hundred different armed groups and political movements, there are broad coalitions which have formed around groups which share similar ideals and ideologies. Following the conclusion of our war of independence, there is no group more powerful than that of the Pan-African 'Accra group', headed by Kwame Nkrumah."
MAF_AAPM_end_of_colonialism: "The End of Colonialism"
MAF_AAPM_end_of_colonialism_desc: "The sad reality of our situation is that the war against colonialism is not yet finished, as the toxic roots of this ideology have been forced deep into our land and our people. From the names of cities to what remains of the European Settlers and beyond, the ripples of our one hundred years of subjugation will leave a lasting impact on our land. However, we shall not be idle. We shall begin a program to completely expel all remaining elements of colonialism from our land."
MAF_AAPM_seizing_the_apparatus: "Seizing The Apparatus Of The State"
MAF_AAPM_seizing_the_apparatus_desc: "Whilst the Germans sought to leave us nothing with their retreat, they could not burn the entire continent. The tools of the coloniser still remain and, per unanimous decision of the central committee, shall be reappropriated in the name of the African People's Movement. Where once they benefited the imperialists, they shall now be employed for the good of the people."
MAF_AAPM_bind_the_continent: "Bind The Continent Together"
MAF_AAPM_bind_the_continent_desc: "The honest truth is that our movement and, indeed, our continent are not as united as many imperialist publications are currently espousing.

MAF_AAPM_appease_the_accord_desc: "Of the great imperialist powers who dominate the globe, it is natural that we find ourselves drawn more to the Accord than the Reichspakt. After all, it is begrudgingly acknowledged that the material support of the Accord was essential to the victory of our armed groups. Despite this, it is not difficult to see that even the Accord did not expect us to achieve such a total victory and they are hesitant to acknowledge the legitimacy of our new state. We shall make some minor concessions to ensure they are happy."
MAF_AAPM_dagger_in_other: "And A Dagger In The Other"
MAF_AAPM_dagger_in_other_desc: "Despite our closeness to the Accord, we shall not remain complacent.

POLITICS_OTTO_ABETZ_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 26th, 1903\nSchwetzingen, Baden, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThe son of an estate manager who died when he was 13, Otto Abetz's rise can be almost wholly attributed to his friendship with and following of Joachim Von Ribbentrop.\n\nHaving met in the late 1920's, the pair had gone to Mittelafrika to make names for themselves. Otto's role in that for Ribbentrop has been as his ideas, society and propaganda man.\n\nBut now Berlin is tired with Ribbentrop's radical solutions. And Otto, he knows how to present himself as a candidate. So now he's in charge of a sinking ship... Will he go down with it? Or will he be on the lifeboats? We will see soon enough."
POLITICS_RUDOLF_ASMIS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 12th, 1879\nMesekenhagen, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nDr. Rudolf Asmis is the has been in the Reichskolonialamt so long he practically ~IS~ the Reichskolonialamt. A long and storied political career, with a notable highpoint being his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimising and formalising local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law.\n\nHe was once eager to see Afrika fulfil a key role in Germany's Weltpolitik but as things begin to unravel in Mittelafrika, his optimism has been replaced with resigned determination to at least see the job though." 
POLITICS_RICHARD_WALTHER_DARRE_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJuly 14th, 1895\nBelgrano, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n§W--------------§!\nSent to Germany at the age of nine to attend school in Heidelberg, he drifted around in the back to the soil movement, developing an abiding interest in farming and agrarianism after graduating from his studies, as well as getting involved with Völkisch groups. However his politics had always involved a strong passion for the African colonies, and as Mittelafrika was consolidated in the 1920's he made the choice to emigrate there.\n\nHe believes that the peasantry is the life-source of the Nordic race from his attachment to the Völkisch movement, and that Mittelafrika represents a great bounty for those peasant-settler-colonist, if they can just clear the land, as the Americans did in the 19th century." 
POLITICS_THEODOR_VON_HIPPEL_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 19th, 1890\nThorn, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nShortly before the First Weltkrieg, von Hippel signed up for the Schutztruppe. His career there under General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck taught him a great deal about war, and fighting with small units. When the East African Campaign ended and Mittelafrika was formed, he stayed in the country, building a career to match that of his storied predecessor, pacifying and controlling the countryside.\n\nHe sought to be apolitical, but in Mittelafrika's hour of need, he now must step up and be more than a general. If he can. "
POLITICS_ALFRIED_KRUPP_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nAugust 13th, 1907\nEssen, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n Alfried Felix Alwyn Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach is a German industrialist, a competitor in Olympic yacht races, contributor to the DNEF and a member of the Krupp family, which has been prominent in German industry since the early 19th century.\n\nOperating in Mittelafrika for over a decade now, Alfried has sought to forge the fractuous colonies into more than a conglomerate of former holdings and instead an industrial nation.\n\nFamously quoted as saying \"We only want a system that works well and allows us to work unhindered. Politics is not our business.\", it has now come to a head and he has been forced into politics anyway by the fallout of Rössing. One wonders what he will do to return to business as usual."
POLITICS_JOACHIM_RIBBENTROP_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 30th, 1893\nWesel, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nOne of his contemporaries wrote in his diary that \"Von Ribbentrop bought his name, he married his money and he swindled his way into office\".\n\nYet he has flourished in Mittelafrika. Partly, because he'll tell anyone anything they want to hear... That and his incredible luck have managed to steer him through the wild-west of Mittelafrikan government ever since he emigrated to the colony after a run-in with General Kurt von Schliecher in the 1930's. In the time since he has learnt how to manipulate Thyssen, and Berlin, primarily by giving them radical solutions to their problems, ones that they perhaps would not dare to utter themselves.\n\nNow he is thrust into the limelight, and the question is, how radical will the solution be this time?" 
POLITICS_FRITZ_THYSSEN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember 9th, 1873\nMülheim an der Ruhr, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nHis father, August, was head of the Thyssen mining and steelmaking company, founded by Fritz's grandfather Friedrich and based in the Ruhr city of Duisburg. Friedrich studied mining and metallurgy in London, Liège, and Berlin, and after a short period in the German Army prior to the First Weltkrieg, joined the family business.\n\nThyssen took over the Thyssen companies on his father's death in 1926, and that same year he formed United Steelworks (Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG), controlling more than 75 percent of Germany's iron ore reserves and employing 200,000 people. He played a prominent role in German commercial life, as head of the German Iron and Steel Industry Association, and as a board member of the Reichsbank.\n\nThe opportunity presented by Mittelafrika however, proved too alluring and when the Government was looking for someone to take over, Thyssen's name came up, and he said yes... He's been mildly regretting that ever since."
