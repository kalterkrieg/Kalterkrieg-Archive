 COL_rising_radicalism: "Growing Political Tensions"
 COL_rising_radicalism_desc: "Ever since the founding of the §RUnión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria§! in 1930, the movement has continuously come into conflict with the conservative led government. While the movement is not widespread, failure of the Conservative government has led to a steady, and worrisome increase in number of the ranks in the PCC.\n\nSmall elements of the movement have taken to attacking the government in the countryside. These guerrilla's will assault government offices and officials, before slipping back into the jungles of the Amazon via boat, or foot. Despite military aid, these frustratingly resilient fighters have managed to cling on, and with growing social divide within the country, are gaining popularity.\n\nDespite claiming otherwise, it is known that elements of the §YPartido Liberal Colombiano§! is aiding the insurgents, and some splinter groups of the Liberal Party have even joined with the communists in the jungle.\n\nDue to the upcoming elections, a noticeable surge in violence has occured, with the insurgents stepping up their attacks, and some bold members even striking within the cities. This has begun to work against them however, as many of these attacks have resulted in civilian casualties. The people have called for vengance against the insurgents, promoting the escalation of the conflict in the South.\n\nWith election year closing in... It remains to be seen who'll come out on top."

 COL_rising_radicalism_2: "La Violencia"
 COL_rising_radicalism_2_desc: "On April 9th, 1948, Jorge Gaitán was shot in the streets of Bogotá, the reason unclear. Within hours, there was rioting in the streets, the assassian of Gaitán lay dead in the streets, beaten to death by the mob. Buildings were burned, opposing sides attacked one another, though the truth of Gaitán's murder would never come to light, any clue being destroyed with the loss of his assassian.\n\nWhen the dust had settled on the ten hour long riots, much of downtown Bogotá lay in ruins, and most shocking of all, nearly three thousand lay dead in the streets, be it rioters, or innocent bystanders who were trambled by the enraged crowd.\n\nColombia has not been the same since, political violence has become mainstray throughout the country. The countryside is no longer ruled by the government, now hosting the members of the §RUnión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria§!. The military is beginning to grow more and more ambitious, as General Pinilla and his §gMovimiento de Acción Nacional§! gain momentum within the deepest levels of the military.\n\nColombia is close to it's breaking point, and the future of her is unclear."

 COL_coffee_economy: "Coffee Economy"
 COL_coffee_economy_desc: "With coffee being such a sought after commodity worldwide, Colombia is able to profit off of this need greatly. Coffee is always in demand, it's always a stable market, and thus the Colombian economy grows with the coffee bush."

 COL_tied_army: "Armed Resistance"
 COL_tied_army_desc: "The Armed Forces are constantly being tied down by members of the UNIR in the jungle south of the Meta river. Due to this increase in resistance, units in the armed forces require much more intensive training in anti-partisan operations, which is both costly and time consuming. To add to everything, soldiers often aren't too keen on shooting their fellow countrymen, which has caused much uproar within military rank and file."

 COL_infrastructure_reform: "Infrastructure Reform"
 COL_infrastructure_reform_desc: "Due to the harsh terrain, and struggles with funding, widespread infrastructure development within Colombia hasn't taken place in the past. However, due to advances in technology and the flourishing of the economy, infrastructure development is now a new reality."

 POLITICS_LAUREANO_GOMEZ_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 20th, 1889\nBogotá, Republic of Colombia\n§W--------------§!\nUnlike the many Heads of State within South America, Gómez's rise to power came quietly. He lived a quiet childhood, mostly concerned with his school work and his chores, before graduating. He'd move on to become an engineer, studying at the National University of Colombia, in Bogotá. He graduated in 1909, though did not follow the path laid for him. In 1909, he founded the paper \"La Unidad,\" which was a fairly popular paper in the country.\n\nHe was first elected to parliament in 1911, and served until 1918. He made quiet an impression in his time, and was soon reelected in 1921. From then, he'd serve in various cabinent roles for the next twenty years. In this time, he became known as one of the most skilled parlimentarians within the nation, easily winning over the favour of the people and the conservative parliament alike. By 1932, he'd become the head of the Colombian Conservative Party, a role that he held dear to his heart. In 1946, to the surprise of many, he won out the presidental nomination, surpassing his opponent, Mariano Ospina Pérez. He officially took office on August 7th, 1946, becoming the new president of Colombia.\n\nNo star is without its faults, however. Gómez has come under increased scrutiny by the Liberals, for his open support of Authoritarian dictatorships around the globe. He's a noted supporter of Boris Savinkov's rise to power in Russia, as well as Argentinian hegemony over the South American Continent. He is also well known for his opposition to universal suffrage, believing that it contradicts societal norms.\n\nQuite the controversial figure indeed, though quite popular too. Laureano Gómez has managed to secure the conservatives to his side as opposition to his rule slowly grows, festering deep in the jungles of the Amazon."
