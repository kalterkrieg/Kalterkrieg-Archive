SIK_old_scars: "Old Scars"
SIK_old_scars_desc: "Jin Shuren, the Butcher of Dihua. His reign as Governor only lasted 5 years, but the legacy of it will be felt for generations. From triggering the Xinjiang Wars of 1936-37, Jin's governorship was characterised by oppression. The harrowing construction of the Gansu Road cost the lives of thousands, and his purges destroyed the lives of thousands more. By his sudden death, he had become one of the most notorious warlords in all of China. Not all of his actions were ruinous; His centralisation policies modernised and streamlined our bureaucracy, abolishing the Dao-yin's and forming a powerful central government. On the whole though, no one looks upon Jin's governorship fondly."
SIK_fragile_peace: "Fragile Peace"
SIK_fragile_peace_desc: "Xinjiang is divided. For decades, Uyghurs, Hui and Han Chinese have heavily opposed each other, and even the Xinjiang Wars did not eradicate the issues. Jin's brutal ethnic policies only served to exacerbate the tensions, and a second Uyghur Rebellion has only been staved off thanks to Governor Liu's hard work in encouraging reconciliation. Even then, little inroads have been made in actually solving the ethnic issues, and a recent return in partisan activity is extremely worrying for the Central Government"

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_LIU_WENLONG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\n1871\nYueyang, Hunan, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nGovernor Liu Wenlong never wanted the spotlight. Beginning his career as a Prefect of various cities throughout Xinjiang, Liu made a name for himself as a competent administrator and bureaucrat, though even he was tainted with the corruption that collapsed the Great Qing. Eventually, his skills were noticed by Governor Yang Zengxin, and Liu was appointed Commissioner for Education in 1922.\n\nLiu would diligently continue in his role, before being transferred to Xinjiang's representative in Beijing. This was an important role, but his 'promotion' was really to keep him out of domestic affairs; his policy of conciliation with the Ugyhurs was unpopular, and deemed to be potentially dangerous to the Xinjiang administration.\n\nWhen Zengxin disappeared in 1936, Jin Shuren was promoted to Governor. The two disliked each other, but Liu's competence in Beijing ensured his position was protected. Shortly before the Xinjiang War, Liu attempted to advise Jin to have a softer touch on the Uyghurs. This, of course, fell on deaf ears, and Xinjiang ignited into civil war. Jin's armies would be victorious, but at the cost of a lengthy partisan campaign stifling administration.\n\nJin's growing unpopularity, mainly over the lingering Uyghur unrest, made Liu unexpectedly popular. Upon Jin's sudden death in 1941, Liu was backed by many elements within the government to become his successor. Though he holds the position of Governor, Liu is really just a civilian figurehead for the military administration. Many would consider being a near-puppet a bad thing, but the elderly Liu is perfectly content to remain in his post, diligently working to keep the fragile peace in Xinjiang."
### Liu was couped by local Uyghurs, bureaucrats and KMT in 1940 as he was hated by everyone, died in 1941 in his Gansu home
