NEP_anti_Rana_unrest: "Anti Rana Unrest"
NEP_anti_Rana_unrest_desc: "The Rana dynasty have reduced the Monarchy to nothing more than figureheads, trapped in the Narayanhiti Palace. They crushed the Nepal Praja Parishad and broke the Jute Mill strike at Biratnagar by force. The people are turned against their autocratic regime in the name of the King and seek a new way forward."

krg_nep.0.t: "The King flees to the Indian Embassy!"
krg_nep.0.d: "King Tribhuvan's anti Rana attitude had been an open secret for a long time in Nepal. King Tribhuvan himself gave explicit support to Nepal Praja Parishad in the 1930's, to try to overthrow the Ranas.\n\n In each instance, however, the Ranas responded harshly, banning liberal movements and executing their leadership. Even then King Tribhuvan worked closely with Praja Parishad in trying to end the Rana regime. However all his efforts have come to nought and he has finally decided on drastic personal action.\n\nHaving left the Palace, King Tribhuvan has taken refuge at the Indian Embassy. He was accompanied by his son Mahendra and the eldest grandson Birendra, among others, leaving the Prime Minister Mohan Shumsher Jung Bahadur furious."
krg_nep.0.a: "What will he do now?"

krg_nep.1.t: "The Nepalese King has fled to our Embassy!"
krg_nep.1.d: "King Tribhuvan's anti Rana attitude had been an open secret for a long time in Nepal.

krg_nep.1.a: "We will evacuate him soon"

krg_nep.2.t: "Gyanendra is crowned King"
krg_nep.2.d: "Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana has responded to Tribhuvan's move by calling an emergency meeting of the cabinet at Singha Durbar. In that meeting he announced Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, the three-year-old grandson of King Tribhuvan, would be the new king of Nepal. In the afternoon, on the same day, Prince Gyandendra Bir Bikram Shah was brought to Hanuman Dhoka Palace and crowned as the king of Nepal."
krg_nep.2.a: "Long Live the King?"

krg_nep_news.0.t: "Gyanendra of Nepal Crowned"
krg_nep_news.0.d: "The Rana family who have been directing the Nepalese kingdom since 1846 as Prime Ministers appear to have gone into such antagonism with their puppet king, Tribhuvan, that he has fled to the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu and is seeking to leave the country.\n\nIn response to the bold move by the King, the Prime Minister Mohan Shamshur Jung Bahadur has had his three year old grandson Gyanendra crowned as King in his place.\n\nAnti-Rana sentiment is a popular past-time in Nepal in recent years, and this latest saga appears to have exacerbated unrest in the country against the autocratic Rana family."
krg_nep_news.0.a: "And all eyes turn to India"

krg_nep.3.t: "India is helping the King Flee!"
krg_nep.3.d: "Two Indian planes landed at Gauchar Airport and flew back to New Delhi with the royal family excluding the infant King, Gyanendra."
krg_nep.3.a: "Who cares, Gyanendra is our puppet."

krg_nep.4.t: "Tribhuvan safely arrived in Calcutta"
krg_nep.4.d: "The two planes we sent that landed at Gauchar Airport and flew back to New Delhi with the royal family excluding the infant King, Gyanendra returned safely."
krg_nep.4.a: "Excellent."

krg_nep_news.1.t: "Tribhuvan of Nepal Flees to India"
krg_nep_news.1.d: "The Indian government has found it in their hearts to provide a safe place for the monarch of their northern neighbour, with two planes that had flown to Nepal returning safely to [IND.capital.GetName] today. \n\nThere has been little news from Nepal since the crowning of Gyanendra, but commentators are reporting that it will all depend on [IND.GetLeader]'s choice (pictured here on the left with King Tribhuvan of Nepal) as to whether to recognise the young king installed by Mohan Shamshur Jung Bahadur, or if they will press Tribhuvan's rightful claim to the country."
krg_nep_news.1.a: "Playing Games in the Himalayas."

krg_nep.5.t: "Informing Nepal on the matter of Tribhuvan"
krg_nep.5.d: "We will inform the Nepalese we do not respect the enthronement of Gyanendra and recommend the formation of an interim goverment with members of the Nepali Congress party, the Rana's and the King's people to convene a constituent assembly to create a democratic constitution.\n\nOnce this advise is accepted, we can start to ensure Tribhuvan's safety before he and the Royal family return."
krg_nep.5.a: "A wise plan"

krg_nep.6.t: "Gyanendra's claim will not be respected"
krg_nep.6.d: "India has informed us they will not respect the enthronement of Gyanendra and recommend the formation of an interim goverment with members of the Nepali Congress party, the Rana's and the King's people to convene a constituent assembly to create a democratic constitution.\n\nThey will be sending people to ensure the safe return of the King. Frankly there is little we can do, and a war with India would be a quick way to the grave."
krg_nep.6.a: "We have no option"

krg_nep.7.t: "Tribhuvan returns to Kathmandu"
krg_nep.7.d: "King Tribhuvan returned to Kathmandu today, retaking his throne with the backing of India and at the head of an interim government that contained both members of the Nepali Congress party and the Ranas. They now have two years to convene a constituent assembly to create a democratic constitution which will hopefully provide the opportunity for the country to move forward into the 20th century after over a hundred years of Rana Despotism..."
krg_nep.7.a: "Hurrah!"

krg_nep_news.2.t: "Tribhuvan of Nepal Retakes His Throne"
krg_nep_news.2.d: "King Tribhuvan returned to Kathmandu today, retaking his throne with the backing of India and at the head of an interim government that contained both members of the Nepali Congress party and the Ranas. They now have two years to convene a constituent assembly to create a democratic constitution which will hopefully provide the opportunity for the country to move forward into the 20th century after over a hundred years of Rana Despotism.\n\nThe Rana dynasty remain a powerful force in Nepali politics, but a combination of massive popular unrest and Indian pressure is a breeze that will bend even the strongest tree."
