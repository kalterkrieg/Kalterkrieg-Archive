### Ideas ###
NAM_windhuk_chaos: "Windhuk in Chaos"
NAM_windhuk_chaos_desc: "With the breakup of Mittelafrika, Windhuk has been thrown into disarray. Deutsch-Südwestafrika is a colonial sub entity that has been thrust back into the light, and everyone is keenly aware that the old colonial administration is no-longer sustainable. Now, everyone is trying to comprehend what the end result of this transition process should be, while trying to keep everything ticking over in the meantime."
NAM_minority_rule: "Minority Rule"
NAM_minority_rule_desc: "Südwestafrika is a nation run by and for the white European settlers and their descendants. Made up predominantly of Germans with a Dutch-descendent Afrikaner minority, the white ruling class has socio-economic control over practically everything in Windhuk. The native peoples, including the Ovambo, the Kavango, and the long persecuted Herero, have no political voice in the Landtag. Without the political will among the ruling class to change this, minority rule is only likely to end through revolution."
NAM_schwerins_legacy: "Legacy of Schwerin's Administration"
NAM_schwerins_legacy_desc: "Very much a status-quo candidate, though one controversial in Berlin due to his close personal ties to the region, Statthalter Hans von Schwerin has been a diligent administratior for Südwestafrika. Since his appointment, he has overseen a gradual empowerment of the Landesrat to prepare for a future, and now very rapidly occuring transition to statehood, maintained the size of Kirchheim's SWAVfEA despite calls to expand it further, and controversially suppressed the use of Afrikaans by the Boer minority in the name of 'Germanisation'."
NAM_The_SWAVfEA: "The SWAVfEA"
NAM_The_SWAVfEA_desc: "The Südwestafrikanische Vereinigung für Einheimische Arbeiter§! (South West African Native Labour Association) was set up by Governor Heinrich Kirchheim in 1943 to deal with labour shortages in the mining and refinement industries in Südwestafrika, and to further stimulate the region's economic growth. Today, many industries utilise the SWAVfEA for manpower and workers but, as exposed in the Rossing Dossier, the organisation is extremely exploitative with flagrant human rights abuses and usage of indentured labour. As a result, the SWAVfEA has proven to be a catalyst for AAPM membership within our nation, and dealing with it will be very difficult because of how central the organisation has become to the industrial processes of Südwestafrika."
NAM_german_refugees: "German Refugee Crisis"
NAM_german_refugees_desc: "Deutsch-Südwestafrika is, arguably, the most politically stable colonial state that has stemmed from Mittelafrika and certainly the one with the highest population of German settlers. It's only natural then that settlers are flocking to our new nation from all over the continent to escape death from the AAPM and other expulsions. The current streams of refugees are stretching our government's capabilities, but it's unlikely to end any time soon."

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_KARL_JUNG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 23rd, 1883\nPirmasens, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n"
POLITICS_HANS_BOGISLAV_GRAF_VON_SCHWERIN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJuly 12th, 1883\nHanover, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nA man with a history in Südwestafrika that is almost as long as his name, Hans-Bogislav Georg Victor Graf von Schwerin-Löwitz, Statthalter of Deutsch Südwestafrika is regarded by almost all as a sensible, respectful and rational pair of hands. A member of the Schwerin noble family, Hans-Bogislav became a Doctor of Law before joining the Foreign Office and travelling to Windhuk in 1909. At the time, he worked as adjutant to Statthalter Theodor Seitz, and those early years in the colony had a deep effect on the young man. He would relocate permanently in 1913, living in the castle-like Schwerinsburg mansion from then on.\n\nAfter the Weltkrieg ended, Hans-Bogislav remained a busy man; a cog in the colonial bureaucracy, conductor of business ventures to mixed success while also chairing the Landesrat§! (a position he held numerous times from 1913). During the 1930s he also used his wealth to assist struggling German farmers in the region.\n\nIt was no surprise then that the Count was appointed Statthalter to deal with the aftermath of the Rossing Dossier, the perfect man to clean up Kirchheim's mess. By all accounts, Hans-Bogislav has done an excellent job running the colony, but now he finds himself in uncharted waters. The breakup of Mittelafrika has put immense strain on the aging bureaucrat, and now Hans-Boglsiav must negoiate a new government for his chosen homeland lest it be burnt away by the raging inferno of Pan-African revolution."
POLITICS_KURT_FISCHER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 3rd, 1902\nLandsberg an der Warthe, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n"

POLITICS_HANS_VON_BACH_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 4th, 1904\nDetmold, Principality of Lippe, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nHans Wilhelm Sartorius von Bach is a tall though not outstanding man, but he is a calm and collected figure who pledges to lead Südwestafrika with a steady hand. Born in Germany, von Bach found himself inspired by the "place in the sun" that Germany bled so much for during the Weltkrieg. A graduate of the Colonial School for Agriculture, Trade and Commerce, Bach moved to Südwestafrika at the age of 21 and never looked back.\n\nStarting a career in agriculture, Bach took a pseudo-Junker path into settler politics. In 1935, following the acquisition of a sprawling farmstead of his own, Bach was elected to the Landesrat, standing as a trustworthy agrarian and conservative voice, with the legitimacy of noble heritage to back him. Since that venture into politics, Bach has remained prominent among the German community. It was Bach that helped form the Conservatives, first as an informal political club of the German community and later as a formal political party to contest the new elections, and it was Bach that led them to victory despite accusations of elitism and cronyism.\n\nThe inaugural Chancellor of the new Volkstaat, Hans von Bach has a lot of work to do. The nation is young and unstable, but his true job is to protect the lives of the German citizens living under his rule. Südwestafrika is their place in the sun, and Bach is damned if they'll lose it to anyone."
POLITICS_ERICH_VON_ZELEWSKI_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 1st, 1899\nLauenburg, Province of Pomerania, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThe nephew of Schutztruppe commander Emil von Zelewski, Erich von Zelewski has run the socio-economic gauntlet of Germany. Born under impoverished nobility, Zelewski quickly worked to dig himself out of his economic situation from day one. Volunteering for the Weltkrieg underage, he served throughout the war with zeal despite being injured several times. Post-war, as the German Golden Age beckoned citizens to migrate to the colonies, Zelewski answered the call.\n\nScraping through the Colonial School for Agriculture, Trade and Commerce, Zelewski migrated to Windhuk in 1923 and quickly joined up with the provincial Schutztruppe. For the next twenty years, Zelewski served part-time as a soldier, part-time as a farmer. Under the command of Theodor von Hippel, Zelewski became experienced in "Bandit-Fighting", though he was often criticised for absurdly harsh conduct and other atrocities.\n\nThough he didn't serve on the front lines of the Bush War, Zelewski helped defend the newly independent Südwestafrikan state in its embryonic days. Respected by the settler community, but disliked by Germany proper for his unsavoury beliefs, Zelewski has finished his climb from poverty to prosperity by being elected the inaugural Chancellor of the People's State of Südwestafrika. How the radical will guide the Volkstaat remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_WOLFGANG_SCHENCK_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 7th, 1913\nWindhoek, German South West Africa\n§W--------------§!\nA flying ace four times over. The first man to fly a jet-powered aircraft into battle… and subsequently the first man to get a victory in one too. The leading man of the People's Party, Wolfgang Schenk is a man known by all in Südwestafrika. The handsome, charismatic pilot is fawned by women everywhere, but those of a political persuasion question how apt Schenck is for his posiiton. He's not a politician but a celebrity, but one that has nonetheless risen to the top.\n\nBorn in Windhuk, Schenck was a proficient pilot by the age of 20§! (no small feat in the early 1930s). Moving to Germany in 1936 and enrolling in the Luftstrieke, Schenck quickly became known for specialising in fighter-bomber combat, helping develop the doctrine of the heavy fighter and pioneering the jet-powered Me 262 during the Second Weltkrieg. By war's end, he'd racked up 23 victories and had flown some 450 combat missions, 110 of which were in jet aircraft.\n\nReturning home in 1948 to a hero's welcome, Schenck advised the Mittelafrikan administration on the rapidly-evolving school of aerial warfare throughout the Bush War. But when Mittelafrika fell, he got involved in the new Südwestafrikan state. Brushed aside by the clientist, old-fashioned Conservatives, Schenck decided to join up with the People's Party to run for office, something they reciprocated with by making him their Chancellor Candidate. Now, Schenck has parlayed his celebrity status into an electoral victory, though the question marks over his political credentials have already started to show."
