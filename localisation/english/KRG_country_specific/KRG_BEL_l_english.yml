### Events ###
krg_bel.0.t: "The Kingdom of Belgium in 1948"
krg_bel.0.d: "With the success of the Belgian Revolution in 1936 and the restoration of the monarchy, Albert I of Belgium's reign was able to continue once more. With the subsequent elections, the CVP/PSC party was victorious and led the country to a small economic revival in the period just prior to the Second Weltkrieg. With the war, Belgium was completely occupied by the syndicalists with the exception of the city of Antwerp, until April 1941. During the unending siege, King Albert was once again on the frontlines fighting against the foreign invaders cementing him as a true legend in Belgian history.\n\nAs the war continued, many Belgians collaborated with the syndicalist forces in an attempt to save themselves and their families and not out of commitment to the cause. On the other hand, however, many syndicalist collaborators were collaborating out of either their hatred for the Albertan government, their hatred for the previous German-led government, or their true beliefs in the system. Regardless of what the collaborators did, Belgium was eventually liberated and democracy was restored. While the KP/DC handedly won the first post-war election, unrest from both former syndicalist collaborators and far-right partisans who fought against the occupiers and see the return of democracy a pathway to the return of the syndicalist menace."
