 JAP_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "Japanese Communist Party/Nihon Kyōsan-tō         §LThe Japanese Communist Party, or the JCP, is one of many communist parties in Japan. Outlawed under the Peace Preservation Law, it is mostly an underground, fringe based organization. It has no support from the political, economic, and military establishment, and is treated as merely scapegoats for many officials should they find themselves in an unfortunate solution. As such, they are unlikely to gain power.§!"

 JAP_radical_socialist_party_long: "Japan Proletarian Party/Nihon Musantō                §LThe more radical wing of the People's Rule Movement, the Japan Proletarian Party has been at the forefront of attacks against the ruling Minseikai. Actively persecuted through many of Japan's security agencies and outlawed under the Peace Preservation Law, it has done little to combat the extremist tide of the Movement. A collection of individuals from both the far left and the far right, the JPP intends to purge Japan of its corrupt institutions and political machineries by any means necessary.§!"

 JAP_social_democrat_party_long: "Japan Cooperative Association                           §LThe Japan Cooperative Association are believers in the so-called "Welfare State" and Cooperative Empowerment. They believed that the empowerment of the masses does not stop in politics, it marches on to other aspects of the Japanese society such as economics. Learning from the oligopolistic and cartel-like nature of the Zaibatsu, they intend to break up the Zaibatsus, provide mass land reformation to the peasantry, along with ending economic exploitation practices such as tenant farming.§!"

 JAP_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "Japan Socialist Party/Nihon Shakai-tō                    §LA coalition of radical reformers, socialists, and anti-establishment figures, the Japan Socialist Party or the JSP is the largest informal opposition party in Japan and the face of the Reformist Faction of the People's Rule Movement. While holding no seats in government and actively persecuted under the Peace Preservation Law, the JSP has consistently kept a large following thanks to the increasing discontent of Japanese citizens towards the current status-quo. Believers in reforming the so-called "archaic system of politics" in Tokyo, they intend on pursuing progressive, socialist-like reforms that are unheard of in Japan, yet they may see their chance in the near future.§!"

 JAP_social_liberal_party_long: "National Reform Association                                    §LThe National Reform Association is a party whose policy platform takes a more radical interpretation of the People's Rule Movement. Instead of merely popularly appointing politicians with bureaucrats subordinate to him, it will extend beyond the confines of government and will expand throughout the entirety of Japan. Every institution from the military to the corporate world will see popular representatives on the top of the hierarchy while the lower half will comprise of generals or corporate executives who will merely "advise" him. This ensures that People's Rule shall extend beyond state affairs, and truly make Japan a place where the people truly rule.§!"

The CDA seeks the total transformation of Japanese political structures to Anglo-American ones. The dismantlement of certain undemocratic institutions such as the Privy Council, the military intelligence agencies, the repeal of the Peace Preservation Law - things that are considered "essential" to the Taisho Democracy method. Women will also be given suffrage, and pork barrel politics will be outlawed and cracked down on.§!"

The Liberal Party focuses on partisan politics, believing it as a necessary means to promote the interests of the people. Similar to the policies of Ichiro Hatoyama, the Liberal Party emphasizes clean politics, opposing pork barrel politics and the overarching influence of the bureaucracy.§!"

Discredited and sidelined after the failed Hayashi administration, they have since undergone a resurgence thanks to the failed China War.

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.0.t: "The Land of the Dying Sun"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.0.d: "The Empire of Japan stands as the last remnant of the Old World in the Far East. What was once the Empire that can challenge the West is now merely hanging on the cliffs of power, as its oldest adversary, China, steadliy reclaims it's power and position as Asia's sole superpower. While Japan still commands a sizable domain over the entire Southeast Asia and its colonial territories still under her tutelage, it is a fragile house of cards, as secessionist organizations sweep the Sphere, waiting for the day that the Rising Sun has finally set.\n\nAt home, the chauvinistic experiments of the IJA and their so-called \"National Defense State\" have failed spectacularly, as a wave of political unrest and silent maneuvers in the Imperial Palace has doomed such enterprise, ushering in a new political order that mimics the old, yet is unstable as the experiments of \"Eastern Democracy\" in the 1920s. Known by foreigners as the People's Government Association and by locals as the Minseikai (A Portmanteau between Minseito and Seiyukai) has swept the streets of Tokyo, entrenching and expanding its tentacles to every societal institution of the Empire. From the halls of the Kokkai (The Diet) and the streets of Marunouchi, power resides only with the Minseikai and her participants, safeguarding the Empire from perceived alterers of the Kokutai. Yet, the Minseikai is much like Japan's grip over its Sphere - a house of cards waiting to fall as His Majesty's subjects grow tired by the political warfare and pervasive corruption that prevails in the Empire.\n\nWith a rising juggernaut at its borders and a political pressure cooker running the show, the Empire walks a tightrope, with nothing but a sea of demise and failure should it make the wrong moves. The Dying Sun requires strength and wisdom, one that its leaders shall oblige..."

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.1.t: "The Shining Jewel of the Far East"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.1.d: "Born out of the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance and the subsequent Boshin War, the Empire of Japan was formally created as a response over the declining power of the Tokugawa Shogunate and a rising sentiment towards the restoration of the Emperor's national authority. Led by Emperor Mutsuhito (commonly known as Emperor Meiji), the newly created Empire embarked on a series of economic, political, and social modernizations that catapulted it into a rising power in the Far East. Known as the Meiji Restoration, what once took centuries for Europe only took 80 years for the Empire to gain such status on the world stage, all thanks towards a genuine yet aggressive acceptance for Modernization. Eventually, as more "liberal" aristocrats became close confidants of the Emperor, along with a growing socio-political movement towards political liberalization, the need for a constitutional government became increasingly apparent, which eventually culminated into the Meiji Constitution, a political document which served as the basis of the Empire's government today.\n\nAs Japan's military and economic power steadily increased, so did its need to project it in Asia. After all, what's the use of power if not to use it? The Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy - the newly created armed forces of the Empire - were at the forefronts of the Empire's expansion, believing that for Japan to secure its place in the sun required the might of its armed forces.\n\nFirst came Korea, then Taiwan, then Port Arthur - territories controlled by empires seemingly stronger than Japan, were humiliated by Japan's modernized armed forces. China, the so-called "Superpower" of Asia, was unable to combat Japan's encroachment over the Korean Peninsula, furthermore lost one of its prized holdings - Taiwan. Russia, a European superpower, was humiliated at the hands of an "inferior" force, the first of its kind. Japan's future shined bright, until the Weltkrieg exposed her weaknesses..."
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.1.a: "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Armed Forces!"

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.2.t: "A Political Pendulum"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.2.d: "Japan's entrance into the Weltkrieg was neither an economic venture nor a geopolitical strategy, but rather a political maneuver orchestrated by Japan's Genros - political statesmen who serve as the Emperor's advisors. These men were the original "founding fathers" of the Empire, and as such their influence is unmatched. Their words became law, and they aren't shy using it.\n\nHowever, that does not mean they are united by any means. Divided between the Civilian Wing (Aristocrats who aimed for the gentrification and bureaucratization of Japan's political system) led by Saionji Kinmochi and the Military Wing (Aristocrats who aimed for autarky and the enfranchisement of the military) led by Yamagata Aritomo, these two wings of the Genro engage in political skirmishes to further their agendas. The entrance of Japan in the Weltkrieg was the epitome of this conflict when the Civilian Wing pressured the Emperor towards siding with the Entente Powers, hoping for a quick and decisive victory.\n\nHowever, the failure to achieve any meaningful victory and the signing of a "Peace with Honour" with the Kaiserreich suddenly turned the Civilian Wing's experiment out of the window. While the Military Wing waned as its Genros slowly met their maker, the Civilian Wing did not emerge unscathed, as the new Party System it created, known as "Taisho Democracy", suddenly started showing its cracks by many in the peasantry, who felt abandoned by the civilian regime as political corruption, systematic issues such as tenant farming, and the inability to solve economic and political crises became increasingly apparent.\n\nAs Taisho Democracy became nothing more than a mechanism of aristocratic rule, many peasants turned to the military, the only institution that can challenge the civilian government. With the Seiyukai operating on a hung cabinet and the passage of the unpopular "National Security Act", Japan's grandiose experiment towards Eastern Democracy is waiting for its demise..."
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.2.a: "As long as they serve His Majesty, what's a little discord going to do?"

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.3.t: "The National Defense State"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.3.d: "Century after century, Japan has faced adversaries far and wide, within and without. Who was there to protect His Majesty's dominion? Who was there to ensure His Majesty's power is restored by the corrupt and the self-serving? It was us - the military. We have protected His Majesty and his throne for centuries, and we will most certainly do it again!" - An excerpt from Senjuro Hayashi's speech to the nation after the May 15 incident.\n\nAs it became clear the current status quo was unsustainable, it was a "necessity" for the military to intervene in civilian politics. Major General Senjuro Hayashi, a ranking member of the Toseiha (Aristocratic Military Officers who advocate Ludendorff's "Total War" Economic Policy and Mechanization of the Military) faction, gave a simple ultimatum to the Emperor - Allow them to intervene or risk Japan falling into Kodoha's (Traditionalist Peasant Officers who advocate a "Showa Restoration") hands. Saionji Kinmochi, one of the last remaining Genros, pleaded to the Emperor that he wait it out, allow it to naturally subside. Fumimaro Konoe, a rising star within Imperial politics and Saionji's right hand, advised the Emperor to appoint Toseiha, believing that their incompetence will eventually destroy their legitimacy. The Emperor obliged to Konoe's advice, and in the shadow of the night, the Toseiha took over Tokyo.\n\nUnfortunately for Konoe, his gamble did not pay off. With the Toseiha having a monopoly on political power, their ambition to create a "National Defense State" became a reality. Aligning with the Reform Bureaucrats (Bureaucrats who advocate centralized and industrialized economy), both factions immediately acquisition every corporation left and right. The Zaibatsus became subordinate partners of the government, and their factories churned out Arisakas instead of Appliances. Saionji's fear has finally been realized - the military controlling the government in a quest for "Total War"."

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.4.t: "Total War, Total Disaster"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.4.d: "As the Toseiha finally achieved their "National Defense State", they wanted to put it in good use. Two targets were chosen - Mainland China and German East Asia. Symbols of Japanese humiliation and Western intrusion in Asia, it was in the Empire's interests to correct such misfortunes, turning symbols of humiliation into monuments of victory. It was seemingly an easy endeavor - the Germans were overstretched and were too pre-occupied with age-old adversaries in Europe, while the Chinese armies are nothing but inexperienced relics\n\nUnfortunately for Japan, only one front succeeded.\n\nThe Pacific War was a swift and clean victory for the Empire, as the aging Dreadnaughts of the Kaiserreich were no match with the combined naval arms of the IJN. The Germans were forced to leave Asia for good, and while they continue "waging war" against the Empire, it is nothing but a foul attempt to save face. However, the Chinese front was another story, as the Fengtian regime, in an act of revenge against our failed assassination of their leader, Zhang Zuolin, has declared war on us, cutting our armies from whatever achievement we have gained in the mainland. As the war waged on and casualties skyrocket, the Empire was forced to make peace with the Chinese. A "Total War" became a total disaster, one that has far-reaching consequences..."
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.4.a: "Well, shit..."

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.5.t: "The New Order"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.5.d: "\"Revere the Emperor, Destroy the Traitors!\"\n\nThis is the rallying cry of the newly created \"People's Rule Movement\", a socio-political movement composed of radical intellectuals, journalists, peasants - anyone who has faced persecution or abandoned by the Empire. While relatively small, it has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the failed campaigns in China. Calling for the radical overhaul of the Empire's political system towards \"Proletarian Democracy\", for the first time since the Empire's inauguration, the status-quo has been challenged. With the movement gaining popularity, it was clear that the National Defense State must end. With pressure from below and maneuvers from two of Japan's most powerful statesmen - Koichi Kido and Fumimaro Konoe, the Toseiha are now political pariahs, never to attain political influence anytime soon.\n\nYet, it wasn't enough. Destroying the National Defense State was one thing, replacing it was another. Kido and Konoe had differing ideas on the \"new order\" that shall arise. Konoe, a sympathizer of the PRM, believed that only when the Empire's weakest link can stand with titans is when the Empire is at its strongest. Kido, a faithful member of the Imperial Court, believed otherwise, and that by enfranchising the lower classes of the Empire, it will ultimately destroy the Empire from within. Only through uniting the gods will the Empire be victorious in her objectives. Kido, for better or for worse, won.\n\nThe Minseikai was the brain-child of Koichi Kido. A political party dedicated to defending the Empire from the \"alterers\" of the Kokutai (National Polity), the Minseikai serves as a bulwark against the PRM and finally put an end towards the bickering Tokyo politics. At least, in theory. In reality, the Minseikai mimicks the old Taisho order - factionalized, corrupt, and elitist. The New Order walks on a knife's edge, with the fate of the Empire lying on the balance."

 KRG_JAP_Domestic.6.t: "The Structures of Power"
 KRG_JAP_Domestic.6.d: "The Empire of Japan is a Constitutional Monarchy under the symbolic leadership of the Emperor. While the Emperor is considered as a living deity and the embodiment of sovereignty, his constitutional powers are limited, with the key exception of his power to appoint Prime Ministers and promulgate laws.\n\nAdvising the Emperor is the Privy Council. While they cannot enact legislation, they can theoretically cease its enactment, albeit it's never been proven nor effective. However, this does not mean that they are the only advisors of the Emperor. The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal is one of the most important positions in the Empire, for it has sole control over the flow of information to and from the Emperor, leading to many calling it a \"Kingmaker\" position.\n\nThe Imperial Diet is the legislature of the Empire. A bicameral legislature, it's divided between the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The House of Peers consists of members of the nobility, such as Imperial Princes, Marquess, Counts, Viscounts, Barons, along with distinguished scientists and statesmen. A relatively stable legislative house, they are known to be non-partisan, with the sole interest of guarding the Imperial Court against outside influences.\n\n The House of Representatives consists, unsurprisingly, of representatives from prefectural districts throughout the Empire. Highly partisan and factionalized, the House of Representatives is a quagmire of political warfare, with politicians battling out over policy.\n\nWhile these are the de jure structures of power, there are also de facto structures, such as the Bureaucracy and the Armed Forces, albeit with the latter's power projection diminished after failure of the National Defense State. The Bureaucracy has the de facto ability to cease the execution of the law should it desire. Unpredictable in many aspects, it is not uncommon for one ministry to eagerly execute the law and another to block it entirely."

 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 29th, 1901\nTōgū Palace, Tokyo, Empire of Japan\n§W--------------§!\nFor the citizens of Japan, the Emperor isn't an ordinary man, nor a simple monarch. He is, put simply, no less than a god, and the living embodiment of the Japanese nation. His Imperial Majesty represents a divine dynasty that has lasted for over two millennia, acting as a universally-respected figure of national unity, irrespective of the viewers ideology or belief.\n\nWhen Hirohito assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne following the Emperor Taishō's death in 1926, there were many uncertainties. The days that followed the May 15th Incident would end them, as democracy fell to pieces and Hirohito approved a coup to restore order to the National Diet. In the Showa era, the National Defence State would rule.\n\nWith Hirohito's silent approval, Japan marched to war on every front. Against the soft underbelly that was the aging German East Asian fleet, the IJN would provide the total victory that Hirohito could be proud of, liberating South-East Asia from the imperialist yoke. But their counterparts in the IJA would more than disappoint. Unprecedented guerilla warfare destroyed overstretched supply lines, and the recapture of Beijing cracked the facade of Japanese invincibility. Eventually, Hirohito couldn't remain silent any longer, and thus he requested a ceasefire be pursued.\n\nThe Emperor's word is gospel, and with it the National Defence State collapsed.\n\nIn its place, Hirohito would oversee a new, civilian-led government to ensure Japan and its Kokutai could survive; the People's Government Association. Having overseen two seismic regime shifts in two decades, the Emperor's true views remain as opaque and mysterious as ever. As the years wear on, many politicians ask. Who really is Hirohito? Only the Imperial Majesty could answer that, something he'd never do."

 JAP_Yoriyasu_Arima_hog_pau_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 17th, 1884\nShibuya City, Tokyo, Empire of Japan\n§W--------------§!\nPolitics is a crude business, especially in the Empire. Regardless of how benevolent one's ambitions may be, they must be ready to cease any semblance of integrity or morality to achieve their visions. That's where Yoriyasu Arima comes in.\n\nOne of Konoe's finest lieutenants, Arima is a product of the statesman's strategic political maneuvers, ensuring that he and his clique will not be left in the dust of the New Order. A revolutionary noble like Konoe, he has endowed himself with the works of Marx and Stirner and an ardent supporter of the People's Rule Movement, believing that such archaic systems eventually bring about resentment and suffering - something that the Empire is currently beset by.\n\nWhile a supporter of People's Rule, he is no saint or blinded by naivety. His stint in both chambers of the Diet has taught him that revolutions require dirty hands - hands which he shall provide. Through a mixture of showering Yen to his rivals and stacking his cabinet with unsavory personalities, he has maintained near-absolute control over the Minseikai, ensuring he has enough ammunition to implement his reforms.\n\nYet, the throne he sits on is nothing but a house of cards. His facade may be clean, but the skeletons remain. The crude tactics that Arima insisted on using incur a debt - one that is awaiting its payment. Eventually, one day or another, his debt will be too much to pay. Yet, at the end of the day...\n\nThe people will decide his fate. After all, the people rule, right?"

 JAP_house_of_representatives_text: "The House of Representatives is the lower house of the Imperial Diet, along with being the battleground of the Empire's political warfare. While dominated by the Minseikai, it is nothing but a fiction of unity, as factions big and small vie for political power and dominance. As Prime Minister, it is your duty to ensure your legislative agenda can navigate the Diet's halls, whether by compromise or force. The inability to pass legislation is the inability to govern and will kill your political career, so tread carefully."

 JAP_house_of_representatives_cda_text_tt: "The Constitutional Democratic Association, at first glance, seems like a set of liberal party democrats seeking to bring about social, economic, and political reform towards Westminster-esque systems. In reality however, their intentions are much more dubious. Known within the Minseikai as the "Corporate Clique", the Constitutional Democratic Association operates as the legislative arm of the Japanese corporate world. Filled with representatives with either direct or indirect connections to the Big Four, the CDA's primary concern is to empower their benefactors through special contracts, government subsidies, or any other legal means."
 JAP_house_of_representatives_yoshida_text_tt: "The Political Friendship Society is a secret society of Party Democrats belonging to the now-defunct Seiyukai. A so-called "alliance" between Shigeru Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama, this alliance is all but in name. In reality, these two individuals jockey for power within the Political Friendship Society, representing two very different schools of thought that have run rampant within this secret society.\n\nThe Yoshida Faction represents the traditional statists within the former Seiyukai - individuals who support the alliance between the Diet and the Bureaucracy. Staunch believers of "Taisho Democracy", the Yoshida Faction believes that the Minseikai is a necessity towards the preservation of Imperial politics from societal actors like the PRM, and that it must be strengthened to prevent such "alterers of the Kokutai" from taking hold over Japan."

In reality, these two individuals jockey for power within the Political Friendship Society, representing two very different schools of thought that have run rampant within this secret society.\n\nThe Hatoyama Faction represents the principled and dogmatic believers of Party Democrats, believes that the Minseikai is a culmination of authoritarian and corrupt political practices that has dominated Japanese politics for decades. Believers in partisan pluralism and political modernization, the Hatoyama faction seeks to embark on a radical reformation of Japanese political institutions, with the end goal of creating a competitive, multi-party Democratic system and a systemic purge of political and economic corruption in the Empire."

In reality, the §YEmpire§! relies on a delicate system of §Bpower brokers§! who guide and steer §YJapanese§! politics since time immemorial.

 JAP_power_brokers_bureaucracy_tt: "The §gBureaucracy§! of §YJapan§! is not your typical pencil-pushers and number-crunchers. While there are plenty of those, they are the foot soldiers of a more powerful set of bureaucrats, ones that exist as a social class in of itself.
