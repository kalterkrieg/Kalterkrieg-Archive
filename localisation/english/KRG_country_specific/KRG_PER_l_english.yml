 POLITICS_HASSAN_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember 20th, 1899\nTabriz, Azerbaijan, Sublime State of Persia\n§W--------------§!\nMohammed Hassan Mirza Shah Qajar is perhaps the most controversial man in modern Iranian history. His brother Ahmad Shah who had been the previous Shah decided to name him Crown Prince in 1917 due to the fact that he only had three daughters and no male heir at the time. This would only last for 5 years. Ahmad Shah finally had a son in 1922 and Hassan's status as Crown Prince was taken from him. This would not deter the ambitious prince, and when Ahamd Shah finally died, Hassan made sure that his children were kept in school at Switzerland so he could consolidate his power in Iran. This still remains a sore subject for some members of the Qajar family.\n\nAfter his ascension to power, Hassan Shah gradually became disillusioned with the democratic trappings of government as he was increasingly sidelined by the Majlis. These tensions finally reached their breaking point in 1942 when Hassan Shah all but ended Iranian democracy in a coup d'état following the horrendous defeats of the Cairo Pact War. Since then he has become the most influential man in Iran as both a populist figure and an arbiter of policy.\n\nHis record as a dictator has been mixed. Many have praised his withdraw from the Cairo Pact War and the rebuilding of the country afterward, but others argue that he is an arbitrary man who has destroyed democracy and who cares more about cars and hunting than running a state."

###ideas###
 PER_lost_cairo_pact_war: "Humiliation of the Cairo Pact War"
 PER_lost_cairo_pact_war_desc: "The Cairo Pact War which lasted from 1939 to 1942 is perhaps the greatest tragedy of the century for us. Thousands of brave men gave their lives in hopes of achieving the new Iranian century. All we gave to them was a bitter defeat and the loss of Zabol when Afghanistan saw weakness in us. The War also worked to expose the glaring lack of reform our army has undertaken over the years. In light of this, the newly ascendant Wahdat Regime has made military reform and rearmament a national issue to prevent another humiliating defeat."
 PER_refugee_crisis: "Refugee Crisis"
 PER_refugee_crisis_desc: "The political crisis in Central Asia has prompted the greatest refugee crisis since the Second Weltkrieg. Millions of refugees have flooded across the border and now live in massive camps located in the north of the country. These camps are severely overcrowded and undersupplied. This combined with a general feeling of xenophobia has led to occasional bursts of violence along the border. Ali Akbar Davar's policy of ambivalence has done little to quell this problem."
 PER_oil_exports: "Oil-Dependent Economy"
 PER_oil_exports_desc: "With the collapse of the British Empire in 1925, Iran became the sole controller of its resources and since then has worked to improve its oil yield and reap the profits from it. While this has led to a steady stream of revenue for our country, it has also left the wellbeing of our economy tied to the price of oil and a handful of oil barons with inordinate influence over our country. This reliance on oil has also lead to most government investment being given to oil and agriculture with industrialization taking a much lower priority.\n\n§RIf oil prices drop, our economy will suffer§!"
