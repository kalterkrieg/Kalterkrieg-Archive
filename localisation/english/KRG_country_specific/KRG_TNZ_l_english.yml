POLITICS_HANS_HUTTIG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 5th, 1894\nDresden, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§LA colonial administrator of mediocre talent, his main ability appears to be that he is capable enough to rally what remains of the bureaucracy and the Askaris in Ostafrika after the chaotic fall of Mittelafrika, to him in Dar es Salaam. How long his regime will last is a question probably answered in months rather than years, but perhaps he will be more than a footnote in history.§!"

## Ideas
TNZ_german_refugees: "German Refugees"
TNZ_german_refugees_desc: "Despite the chaos that engulfs the continent, German refugees still flee here, at least in the short term before continuing on to other places, or trying to make new lives here.\n\nTheir presence stretches already thin resources, but the state must welcome them to her bosom and hold them close until they are ready to restart their lives, or leave this damned continent behind."
TNZ_heart_of_chaos: "The Heart of Chaos"
TNZ_heart_of_chaos_desc: "With the breakup of Mittelafrika, Dar-es-Salaam is a wild-west town barely under the control of the government. Armed men roam the streets and soldiers are as dangerous as bandits. The country is thrown into disarray as the old colonial subunit of Deutsch-Ostafrika emerges as a bastion of the former colonial regime despite the best efforts of the AAPM.\n\nEveryone is keenly aware that the colonial administration is no-longer sustainable - business as usual is dead. Now, everyone is trying to comprehend what the future holds for the region, while trying to keep things going. The end result is rather like trying to change one's engine, windscreen wipers and wheels all while doing the speed limit on the highway!"
TNZ_minority_rule: "Minority Rule"
TNZ_minority_rule_desc: "What little government remains in control, it has one unifying thing. They are primarily Europeans. While there is no formal colour bar, the tumult that has overtaken the colony will probably not be resolved while the rulers do not look like their subjects."

krg_tnz_news.0.t: "The Tanganjikan Herrgebeitschaft"
krg_tnz_news.0.d: "Embattled former colonial administrator and executive chairman of the Vereinigte Tanganjika-Partei (United Tanganyika Party), Hans Hüttig, today announced the official consolidation of the territory that map-makers have labeled 'Deutsch-Ostafrika' until recently into the Herrgebietschaft of Tanganjika.\n\nThis apparently represents a solidification of the hold-out colonial regime, which has been fighting to retain it's territorial integrity with Germany's tacit support. Holding roughly the territory of the former German East Africa prior to the Weltkrieg, it appears, along with Südwestafrika, that the presence of Germany in Africa isn't over just yet. But what that will look like? Nobody can say just yet."
krg_tnz_news.0.a: "Interesting times..."

krg_tnz_news.1.t: "Army Coup Foiled in Tanganjika!"
krg_tnz_news.1.d: "The authorities in Tanganjika today managed to arrest and depose the leader of the Tanganjikan Schutztruppe, 'Field Marshal' Bayume Mohamed Husen, after he attempted to overthrow the Hüttig regime.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, he and his confidants broke into the Wissmannpalatz in Dar Es Salaam, and shot Chairman Hüttig to death with their rifles. The noise aroused the Askaris who served as his bodyguards and they started a fire-fight with Husen and his men until additional reinforcements were called. The reinforcements arrived under the command of Kai-Uwe Von Hassel, and they managed to capture Husen and his cronies.\n\nAs the dust settles, it appears that Von Hassel, another former colonial administrator and politically active in the colony as a leader of a more moderate strand within the Vereinigte Tanganjika-Partei, will take the Chairmanship and lead the country into the uncertain future."
krg_tnz_news.1.a: "Dirty deeds done in darkness?"

krg_tnz_news.2.t: "Praetorian Coup Foiled in Tanganjika!"
krg_tnz_news.2.d: "The people of Tanganjika today awoke to the state radio station informing them of the death of Chairman Hüttig of the Vereinigte Tanganjika Partei and the assumption of power by 'Field Marshal' Bayume Mohamed Husen.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, Hüttig's trusted Askari bodyguards turned on him as he slept in the Wissmannpalatz in Dar Es Salaam, and shot Chairman Hüttig to death with their rifles. The noise aroused nearby Schutztruppe who served as the external security for the building and they started a fire-fight with the traitorous Askaris, while calling for additional reinforcements. The reinforcements arrived under the command of Husen, with the bodyguards being wiped out to a man.\n\nAs the dust settles, it appears that the future of Tanganjika will be as violent as the rest of Africa, though Field Marshal Husen assures the people they will be safe in his care."
krg_tnz_news.2.a: "A valued destiny comes to nothing."

krg_tnz.0.t: "The Aftermath of the Dar Conference"
krg_tnz.0.d: "Placeholder: Well that sucked, and now we're nothing but a remnant holdout lead by a creepy eyed nazi."
krg_tnz.0.a: "When life gives lemons, make lemonade."

krg_tnz.1.t: "The Herrgebietschaft of Tanganjika"
krg_tnz.1.d: "Placeholder: If we go running back to Germany and declare our willingness to be their toehold in Africa, they'll help us"
krg_tnz.1.a: "When life gives lemons, make lemonade."

krg_tnz.2.t: "Dirty Deeds Done in Darkness"
krg_tnz.2.d: "Placeholder: Husen leads a small band of men into the Wissmannpalatz and shoots the Hüttig with his trusted allies. However this alerts Hüttig's bodyguards. There's a firefight and then some other Askaris turn up, either lead by von Kassel, or without leadership. If there's no leader then as the dust clears, Husen will convince them to turn on the bodyguards who he will blame for the murder and use as a pretext to seize power."
krg_tnz.2.a: "The reinforcements were led by von Kassel."
krg_tnz.2.b: "The reinforcements were led by Husen, of course."
