ROM_idea_dreams_of_transylvania: "Dreams of Transylvania"
ROM_idea_dreams_of_transylvania_desc: "Since 1859 the Principalities of the Romanian people, Wallachia and Moldavia, were united under Alexandru Ioan Cuza.  His name is famous in the history of Romania for his fulfilling a national dream of the 1848 revolutions. The continuation of Romania under Carol's grandfather was another victory for his people. The joining of Bessarabia during the Russian collapse in the first Weltkrieg made Ferdinand I, Carol's father, another great ruler to his people.\n\nIt is Carol's greatest desire to be remembered as the King who brought about the final Great Union of the Romanian people, with their brothers in Transylvania.\n\nWere it not for the attempt on Carol's life by the traitorous Iron Guard, he would have already achieved it, he is certain." 
ROM_idea_iron_guard_remnants: "Iron Guard Remnants"
ROM_idea_iron_guard_remnants_desc: "Savinkov supported the Belgrade Pact, primarily though Legionnaire-controlled Romania. Rumors swirl that the Vozhd was to have a hand in a coup to depose the King, but Carol struck first, killing Codreanu and then crushing an attempted coup by Horia Sima and the Iron Guard's 'Avengers'.\n\nThough mostly dismantled, remnants of their extremist movement still persist in the backcountry, occasionally coming out of nowhere to harrass the gendarmerie and sow unease among the people." 
ROM_idea_oil_to_germany: "Oil to Germany"
ROM_idea_oil_to_germany_desc: "In exchange for economic and social aid, Romania has allowed Germany access to a large part of the oil production in the city Ploiesti. While this does turn away some funding that could go towards the country, the Germans have offered us great support with economic & construction projects such as the 'Pan-Romana Autostrada'. The oil leasing debate will need to be evaluated soon however, as some politicians believe the aid received is not commensurate to the value our oil would reach on the world market."
ROM_idea_belgrade_pact: "Belgrade Pact Member"
ROM_idea_belgrade_pact_desc: "We are an integral part of the Belgrade Pact, a former military triumvirate between ourselves, Serbia & Greece. Following the 4th Balkan War, the Belgrade Pact reformed into a regional socio-economic bloc, leaving the military elements by the wayside. However, our nations are connected by a strong, cultural bond, and if the time comes where we need to protect our brothers, we will be by their side!"
ROM_idea_treaty_of_dedinje: "The Treaty of Dedinje"
ROM_idea_treaty_of_dedinje_desc: "The 4th Balkan War, which started so promisingly, ended in abject disaster for Bulgaria. What is their loss has been Romania's gain, and we still receive reparations payments to this day."

## Deal with the Iron Guard ##
ROM_dealing_with_the_Iron_Guard: "Dealing with the Iron Guard"
ROM_dealing_with_the_Iron_Guard_desc: "Ever since the Legionary Rebellion, Carol II has been seeking to find the means to crush the remnants of this odious political faction who sought to depose him from his rightful throne.\n\nNow he believes if he sends the Gendarmerie into the countryside, he can root them out once and for all."
ROM_police_operation: "Send Gendarmes Into The Countryside"
ROM_round_up_sympathisers: "Round Up Prominent Sympathisers"
ROM_crush_the_diehards: "Crush The Last Diehards"

krg_rom.0.t: "The Last Iron Guard"
krg_rom.0.d: "After an exhaustive search and chase, the security forces believe they've stamped out the Iron Guard once and for all, including killing their leadership.\n\nWhilst Horia Sima was not arrested, survivors of several police actions state that he was killed during a fight with gendarmes several months ago, but was so badly wounded by an explosion during the combat that he was not recognised by the police.\n\nThe round up of the final Iron Guard members has confirmed his death, which explains the recent uptick in how radical their actions were."
krg_rom.0.a: "Excellent"

krg_rom.1.t: "The King is Dead"
krg_rom.1.d: "King Carol II died today of a congestive heart failure. His doctor was called but arrived late to the scene, and by the time he had made it, the King had already expired.\n\nHis son, Mihai I will take the throne, continuing the Monarchy. What this means for the Camarilla, that coterie around the King who ran the government and enriched themselves... little is known."
krg_rom.1.a: "Long Live the King."

krg_rom.2.t: "Carol II of Romania has died"
krg_rom.2.d: "The King of Romania has died of a heart attack. Known for his personally lavish and hedonistic lifestyle, this does not come as a surprise to those in the know.\n\nHis government was ridden with personal favouritism and several cronies ascended to top government posts. It remains to be seen how his son Mihai I, the new King of Romania feels, but signs point to trouble on the horizon for those close to the former King."
krg_rom.2.a: "A fresh broom cleans house!"
