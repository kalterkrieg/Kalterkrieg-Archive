 ### SPIRITS ###
 GRE_clientist_regime: "Clientelist Regime"
 GRE_clientist_regime_desc: "For practically all of its existence, Greece's government has only facilitated its actions for a select group of people and groups. In recent decades, one or two hundred business magnates have benefited from government initiatives instead of the wider public. The king, some say, is in league with these magnates and bureaucrats, along with powerful men controlling other countries: whether it be Canada, Britain or France, their elites and dignitaries hold large sway in our political life."
 GRE_civil_war_recovery: "Legacy of the Symmoritopólemos"
 GRE_civil_war_recovery_desc: "The Restoration of the Monarchy after the Treaty of Dedinje opened a wave of political opposition from the strengthening Syndicalist Labour Party of Greece, supported by Paris to consolidate a Third Internationale stronghold in the Mediterranean. Failures to either appease or crush the SEKE and their Trade Union allies boiled over into strikes and rioting, and then finally the Dekemvriana of 1942, where the newly formed "Democratic Army of the Internationale" rose up and put Athens under siege.\n\nThe putsch was a failure, and Paris never got their Mediterranean ally, but the fighting continued. Three and a half years of brutal guerrilla warfare sapped Greek and Entente strength, but eventually the Syndicalists were encircled and crushed, with survivors fleeing into neutral Bulgaria. Since 1946, the goal of the various Venizelist governments has been one of reconstruction and reconciliation. This has largely been a success, but a great effort will need to be done to heal the nation."
 GRE_divided_parliament: "A Parliament of Animosity and Feuds"
 GRE_divided_parliament_desc: "Before the 1938 Referendum, Greek politics was largely dominated by the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalist Populists. But today, the political sphere is so atomised its hard to ever believe that it was once fairly united.\n\nEvery year, parties chop and change. Splinters are created, they merge, then splinter again. The average government lasts 8 months, and are usually built on fragile coalitions of competing personalities and interests. Half of the parties that exist in the Hellenic Parliament do so because their leaders have some kind of grudge with another politician, and actual fights on the Parliament floor are common. This atomisation is encouraged by proportional voting systems, allowing every party to get some kind of foothold in the Parliament. At this point, King Alexander's main national involvement is simply consecrating new governments.\n\nThat said, the idiosyncratic system is, for now, relatively stable in its own way. No Prime Minister can rest on their laurels, knowing that failure can lead to a reshuffle with their job on the line. In addition the relative ideological similarities of many groups means that votes are often along broad ideological lines, with bills passing through Parliament relatively smoothly. However this revolving door of cabinets cannot last forever. At some point, one group will consolidate power. And everyone hopes that it'll be them."
 GRE_belgrade_pact: "Belgrade Pact Member"
 GRE_belgrade_pact_desc: "We are an integral part of the Belgrade Pact, a former military triumvirate between ourselves, Serbia & Romania. Following the 4th Balkan War, the Belgrade Pact reformed into a regional socio-economic bloc, leaving the military elements by the wayside. However, our nations are connected by a strong, cultural bond, and if the time comes where we need to protect our brothers, we will be by their side!"
 GRE_idea_treaty_of_dedinje: "The Treaty of Dedinje"
 GRE_idea_treaty_of_dedinje_desc: "The 4th Balkan War, which started so promisingly, ended in abject disaster for Bulgaria. What is their loss has been Greece's gain, and we still receive reparations payments to this day."
