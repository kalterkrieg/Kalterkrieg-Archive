krg_liberia_news.1.t: "Successful Coup in Liberia"
krg_liberia_news.1.d: "Reports have come out of Monrovia earlier today that opposition forces loyal to Didwho Twe have taken control of the Government.\n\nThis comes in the wake of a period of unrest following the elections earlier this month; President Tubman's True Whig Party had again managed to maintain their hegemony with no contest. The unrest appears to have been in part due to the opposition Reformation Party being outlawed. It was believed by many that the Reformation Party had been dissolved by these actions but this coup proves this was not the case.\n\n President Tubman denounced Twe's forces as traitors and 'tribalists' while vowing to return to the country and resume his rightful mandate once the coup has been dealt with. At time of reporting, forces loyal to Tubman have vowed not to recognize the new government while he remains in exile."
krg_liberia_news.1.a: "Could this have been planned?"

krg_liberia_news.2.t: "Attempted Coup in Liberia"
krg_liberia_news.2.d: "President Tubman earlier today denounced opposition leaders after an attempted coup and assassination attempt.\n\nThis was the culmination of a period of internal unrest after last week's elections. Tubman's True Whig Party had won the election with no contest, after outlawing the opposition Reformation Party. The diehard faction of the Reformation Party obviously felt the election was a fraud, which spurred them to action, though it is unknown if this was spontaneous or not at present.\n\nTubman announced his government will crush the traitors and 'tribalists' who survived their coup attempt. Additionally he blamed the machinations of global power politics and decried international interference in Liberian affairs, mobilising the Frontier Guards in response."
krg_liberia_news.2.a: "Tubman further cements his rule."
