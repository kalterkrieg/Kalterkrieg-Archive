 SPR_republican_dream_desc: "After the failure of the First Republic and the incompetent and authoritarian bourbon family ruling and oppressing the working class, the new Republic is a torch that shines brightly in a darker world. It strives for the equality and well-being of the population while giving the people a responsible and functional government for and by the people. But this dream is not for certain, as monarchist forces, as well as reactionaries, wait in hopes of striking the Republic of a mortal blow. We need to make sure the people see the Republic as the best and most efficient government, or the consequences would be disastrous..."
 SPR_unrulely_communes: "Unruly Communes"
 SPR_unrulely_communes_desc: "The communes are self-governing bodies recognized by the government in which the workers share the workplace or a job. The workers organize and decide what decisions are to be made in order for them to be more efficient and for the well-being of the people, sometimes overruling or differing from the central government policies or laws. All over the country communes are present, where the workers decide and mostly rule themselves without much care of what the government says. This while proving great for the worker's morale and efficiency results in our bureaucracy suffering and our options limited in what we can, or what we can't enforce on them."

 SPR_divided_government_desc: "As a semi-presidential republic power is shared between the President and Prime Minister. However, a rift has formed between former friends Juan Negrin and Indalecio Prieto. Negrin opposes the reformist direction of the PSOE and has allied himself with the PS, CNT and even the PCE in order to overthrow Prieto. Meanwhile Prieto has begun corting the PRR as a new ally to replace the hardliners. Now Spain faces two options, reform into a Social Democratic state or maintain Syndicalist and Communist principles as the last bastion of European Socialism"
 SPR_right_wing_resistance: "Right-Wing Resistance"
 SPR_right_wing_resistance_desc: "The right-wing parties have recently gained much support from the population after recovering from the civil war. Most of them just want the progressive government gone, and while their views vary greatly, most of them are only acceptant of the republic, while others are openly monarchists. Their influence is mostly spread through rural areas and also thanks to the catholic church, which still has enormous influence over the population. This problem needs to be addressed sooner or later because if left unchecked they could very well overthrow the current government."

 SPR_galician_nationalism: "Galician Nationalism"
 SPR_galician_nationalism_desc: "Galicia is one of the most rural and underdeveloped regions of Spain. This has left its population with a sense of hate towards the Spanish government, which has since the start of the century not worried about the Galician lands. The Republic came as a ray of hope for nationalists but the failure of the Statute of Autonomy has proven to most Galicians that the new government is not different from the ones that came before. Antonio Aranda, one of the generals to resist the invasion of Galicia by the republican forces in the siege of Lugo is hailed as a hero for the people, and will surely prove troublesome for the government. Either repressing or granting them autonomy would probably suffice to end the calls of nationalism, but if left without checking the Galicians might use any opportunity to ensure their freedom."

 SPR_backwards_economy_desc: "Spain was never an industrial power, but with the recent devastation that the civil war brought with it, the economy was destroyed. During the Weltkrieg trading and exporting helped the economy recovered, but the defeat of the syndicalists came with sanctions by the great powers who wanted to punish Spain for its starting support for the Internationale, leaving what little industry was left ruined. Spain is in dear need of reform and modernization, so it can once again be a major power on the world stage."

 krg_spr.0.t: "The Second Spanish Republic"
 krg_spr.0.d: "The second Spanish Republic was born shortly after the start of the civil war, comprised of democrats, socialists, anarchists, syndicalists, communists and other minor left-leaning parties. Its existence almost came to an end within the first year of the civil war, but strokes of good luck,  support from the neighbouring Commune of France and an alliance made by the Anarcho-Syndicalist and the Socialists at the start of 1937 prompted it to the victor of the civil war, and the old Kingdom was soon a relic of the past overthrew by revolutionary fires.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Republic took a non-belligerent stance, aiding the Third Internationale but never siding with them. This would change with the Austrian Intervention in the war when leaders of the Republic were quick to see that the syndicalist's nations were bound to lose the war. Fearing that invasion could come after the capitulation of the Commune, Spanish president Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz was quick to announce that Spain would become a neutral nation. Afterwards came a period in which the country slowly turned towards a more state-capitalist system, and tried to restore ties with the Entente to avoid becoming isolated and potentially being invaded by the ever-looming germans."

 krg_spr.1.t: "The Second Spanish Republic"
 krg_spr.1.d: "Spain is a unitary integral state, meaning that although the central government has the say over most of the country affairs, autonomies to a lesser degree are allowed to rule themselves. There are two types of autonomic regions recognised by the constitution; Autonomies and Communes.\n\nThe Autonomies are regions that are considered historically and culturally different from Spain proper, so they are allowed to have more say in their regions, and teach their languages in schools or use it as an official language. As of right now, there are two; Catalonia and The Basque Country. Galician nationalists have called for its incorporation as a 3rd autonomy, but such calls have been ignored by the central government due to the opposition of the CNT, which needs both the permission of the central government and the autonomical one to set up new communes, making in it much harder than it's in only government-run regions.\n\nThe communes are the result of the comprise of the 1937  §SPSOE-§!§RPS§! alliance, in which the CNT was allowed to set communes in the country wherever a majority of workers wanted. They function in a similar way to autonomies but have much more power over worker's legislature and tend to be more unruly and distrustful of the Madrid government than the Autonomies. Most of these communes are present in Eastern Spain and Asturias and have almost no representation in the more rural areas that are right-wing leaning."

 krg_spr.2.t: "The Second Spanish Republic"
 krg_spr.2.d: "Spain is a unicameral republic, in which universal suffrage is enforced throughout the nation.\n\nThe ruling party of the Republic is the  §SPSOE§!, a social-democrat party with Marxist tendencies that has slowly embraced capitalism over the past decade. It strives for the centralization of the Republic although it supports the Autonomies, it's not a fan of the communes that sprung all over the country after the end of the civil war. The leader of the party since 1942 is Indalecio Prieto, one of the lesser radical members of the  §SPSOE§!, and president of the republic.  The §SPSOE§! works with the §RPS§! (who represent the CNT) in a coalition, in which the CNT works doubtfully in acceptance that it's their only chance of ensuring their ideals are spread to the population. The CNT sends \"representatives\" to parliament as it refuses to present itself as a regular party due to their goals being anarchist, even though in practice it works like one.\n\nThe right-wing had almost vanished until the 1946 elections when a coalition of right-wing forces, the §ZPartido Español Conservador§! or §ZPEC§! for short won more than a quarter of the parliament. The §SPSOE-§!§RPS§! victory was still ensured, but it made clear to the leftists that if left unchecked the right-wing might once again rise to power.\n\nThe new elections have had both parties fight for only one thing, and that thing is Lerroux's party, the §OPartido Republicano Radical§!, a more centrist-leaning party that has stayed neutral most of the time. Both parties fight for its influence, as for the right it could mean an electoral victory, and for the left especially the §SPSOE§! could mean kicking the §RPS§! out of government once and for all."
