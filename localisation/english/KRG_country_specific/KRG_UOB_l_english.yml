UOB_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "Free Republican Movement\n§gA minor political movement that has picked up steam following the Restoration, the Free Republican Movement was one of the first explicitly anti-Mosley movements within the Union of Britain, formed in 1935 by former TUC members Ernest Thurtle and Arthur Greenwood with the goal of preserving the republican, parliamentarian system before the then Deputy Chairman had even taken power. Both men and their main supporters would be jailed for much of the next 15 years, but were released during the downfall of Mosley's regime. Today, they act as an obstructionist political grouping within London, campaigning for a referendum on the Monarchy and a return to a republican (though explicitly not syndicalist) system.§!"

### Events ###

krg_uob.0.t: "Second Great Strike"
krg_uob.0.d: "The situation in the country has deteriorated greatly. Barely any work is done and the people are on the streets, picketing their workplaces, and marching to demand changes. This cannot go well.\n\nThe armed forces stand ready to assist the police if requested, and the police are currently reporting the mood is belligerent but there has been no sign of direct action yet.\n\nIf we are lucky, we might still ride this out."
krg_uob.0.a: "Rabble rabble rabble!"

krg_uob.1.t: "Second British Revolution"
krg_uob.1.d: "The imposition of the House of Windsor once more on the British Isles appears to have taken a major setback. There are reports of an uprising by the Syndicalist movement in Britain! Apparently you can't keep an idea down.\n\nWith the General Strike spiralling out of control, it appears that the time has come once again to take up arms in order to resolve the matter of who exactly is in charge of Britain."
krg_uob.1.a: "For King and Country"
krg_uob.1.b: "For Union and Worker (play as UoB)"
krg_uob.1.c: "For Leader and Revolution (play as Maximists)"

krg_uob.2.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
krg_uob.2.d: "It was always a question of how long it would be before the United Front fell. Those diehard Maximists who had managed to avoid the dragnet were always going to seek to put the clock back to the glory days of the 1930's.\n\nFor the rest of us living in the real world, this might just be the nail in the coffin of any hope of tossing out the Windsors and their colonial lackeys."
krg_uob.2.a: "Blasted Maximists"

krg_uob.3.t: "Germany Demands Compliance with Oxford"
krg_uob.3.d: "While we do not recognise the Oxford Treaty signed by the Occupation Government, the Germans do. And they have the means to make it very painful for us if we don't play along, at least for the time being."
krg_uob.3.a: "Blasted Germans"
krg_uob.3.b: "Blast the Germans"

krg_uob.4.t: "Germany Demands Economic and Security Treaties"
krg_uob.4.d: "The Germans demand a pact of non-aggression and economic concessions from our government. In turn Germany will guarantee our independence in the face of the Accord's continued desire to reclaim the country."
krg_uob.4.a: "Blasted Germans"
krg_uob.4.b: "Blast the Germans"


krg_uob.5.t: "New Constitution"
krg_uob.5.d: "There are two different plans. Forming a British Republic with a mixed-market economy as Germany wishes, perhaps in order to avoid external intervention in our affairs for some time at least and a more gradualist approach now the main battle has been won.\n\nOr we can listen to others push for the true reformation of the Union of Britian"
krg_uob.5.a: "A republic will suffice for now."
krg_uob.5.b: "We will complete the revolution"

krg_uob.6.t: "Rise of the Second British Revolutionary Government"
krg_uob.6.d: "With the success of the second British Revolution, we now have a rogue revolutionary government off our shore. The foreign ministry has drafted a set of demands for the new government. Primarily, we want them to recognize the Oxford Treaty and remain open for our business and trade."

krg_uob.6.b: "We don't care for an insignificant island"

krg_uob.7.t: "The British Government Reject Our Demands"
krg_uob.7.d: "The British Revolutionary Government has rejected our demands. The genreal staff is caling for a military operation to 'stamp out the threat in it's cradle' while the government there is still weak. \n\nWhile members of the intelegence service and foreign office alternately are pushing the idea of using members of the British Peoples Party to influence the government."
krg_uob.7.a: "Prepare the ships. We go to war."
krg_uob.7.b: "We will influence their politics."

krg_uob.8.t: "[GetYear] Britsh Republican Elections"
krg_uob.8.d: "With the reestablishment of a republican parliament the seats need to be filled. The main parties are the British Republican Party and the Union Labour Party"
krg_uob.8.a: "A BRP victory"
krg_uob.8.b: "A ULP victory"

krg_uob.9.t: "[GetYear] Trade Union Congress Elections"
krg_uob.9.d: "With the reasteablishment of the Trade Union Congress local and regional elections have taken place. With the lack of proper ogranisation due to the only recent reestablishment of the congress a lot of factions are ving for control."
krg_uob.9.a: "The moderate stream succeed"
krg_uob.9.b: "The neo-maximalists secure a majority"

krg_uob.10.t: "Open Syndicalist Resistance"
krg_uob.10.d: "While we occupy the major cities much of the countryside still has many radicals lingering. After we beat them back they have just risen up again. When will this end?"

krg_uob_news.1.t: "Second British Revolution"
krg_uob_news.1.d: "The imposition of the House of Windsor once more on the British Isles appears to have taken a major setback. There are reports of an uprising by the Syndicalist movement in Britain once again.\n\nThough bloodied and discredited by the events of the Second Weltkrieg, it appears that the British Left are not ready to give up on a different mode of existence just yet!"
krg_uob_news.1.a: "Syndicalists at it Again"

krg_uob_news.2.t: "Revolutionary Victory in Britain"
krg_uob_news.2.d: "Despite the odds, the Revolutionary flame that burns in Britain has not being stamped out. Instead it seems to burn brighter than ever as for the second time inside of fifty years, the House of Windsor is forced to flee it's most fractuous and unruly dominion (a title once reserved for the Irish).\n\nWhat the future holds for the British Isles, few can predict, but it appears that the legacy of Mann and Mosley has not been written out fully yet."
krg_uob_news.2.a: "Once More the Island Falls"

krg_uob_news.3.t: "Government Victory in Britain"
krg_uob_news.3.d: "The odds faced by the Revolutionary forces were ultimately never in their favour. After initial setbacks, the British Government forces managed to rally and overwhelm the disorganised rabble of workers and extremists who had slipped through the anti-Syndicalist dragnet operating on the island.\n\nWith this final battle between the forces of democracy and revolution in Britain, it would appear the professional agitators are permanently out of a job."
krg_uob_news.3.a: "God Saved the King"

krg_uob_news.4.t: "The [ENG.GetFactionName] Intervene in Britain"
krg_uob_news.4.d: "The roar of airplane engines was heard today over Canada as long-range flights were launched to commence a bombing campaign against the Syndicalist diehards in Britain. The official request from His Majesty's Government has pulled the [ENG.GetFactionName] into one more battle against the Reds.\n\nHow it will end is still unknown, but it is one thing to strike against an overwhelmed and unpopular government, and quite another to face down the full might of a global alliance.\n\nIt seems the British will learn this lesson twice."
krg_uob_news.4.a: "Time to stamp out some fires."
