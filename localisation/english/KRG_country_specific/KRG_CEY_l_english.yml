 CEY_Language_Conflict: "The Language-Ethnic Conflict"
 CEY_Language_Conflict_desc: "The Sinhalese people are the majority on the island, however the largest minority, the Tamils have their own ancient linguistic traditions. There is a conflict between the two as to which language would be best suited for official business."
 CEY_Conflicting_Loyalties: "Conflicting Loyalties"
 CEY_Conflicting_Loyalties_desc: "With Dravida Nadu across the water, a section of the Tamil part of society on the northern half of the Island seeks to move closer or retain ties with the subcontinent to the north. This is opposed to national interests and causes strife."
 CEY_Caste_System: "Ceylon's Caste System"
 CEY_Caste_System_desc: "The caste systems of Ceylon are social stratification systems found among the ethnic groups of the island since ancient times. The models are similar to those found in Continental India, but are less extensive and important for various reasons. They are more similar to feudalism as practised in Europe. However being a feudal nation in a modern era is no benefit."
