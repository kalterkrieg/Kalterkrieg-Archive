### Starting Parties ###
ENG_authoritarian_socialist_party: "PRP/MF"
ENG_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "§LPopular Revolution Party/Maximist Front§!"
ENG_radical_socialist_party: "Labour(Actionists)/BPLA"
ENG_radical_socialist_party_long: "§LLabour Party Actionists Faction/British People's Liberation Army§!"
ENG_social_democrat_party: "Labour(M)"
ENG_social_democrat_party_long: "§LMorrison's Labour\n§gThe center of Clement Attlee's former Parliamentarians have reformed under his old deputy Herbert Morrison, having defected en-mass from the Union of Britain in the last years of the war. Commonly referred to as "Morrison's Labour", to differentiate themselves from the syndicalist, collapsed old Labour Party, his contingent include a collection of more moderate politicians.§!"
ENG_revolutionary_republican_party: "FRM"
ENG_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "§LFree Republican Movement\n§gA minor political movement that has picked up steam following the Restoration, the Free Republican Movement was one of the first explicitly anti-Mosley movements within the Union of Britain, formed in 1935 by former TUC members Ernest Thurtle and Arthur Greenwood with the goal of preserving the republican, parliamentarian system before the then Deputy Chairman had even taken power. Both men and their main supporters would be jailed for much of the next 15 years, but were released during the downfall of Mosley's regime. Today, they act as an obstructionist political grouping within London, campaigning for a referendum on the Monarchy and a return to a republican (though explicitly not syndicalist) system.§!"
ENG_social_liberal_party: "SLRG/LA"
ENG_social_liberal_party_long: "§LSocial and Liberal Reform Group/Liberal Action\n§gAfter being banned by the Mann Government in 1932, the Liberal Party completely collapsed into various groups. The group that eventually became the rump Social and Liberal Reform Group claimed the linage of the 'New Liberal' remnants with staunch anti-syndicalist policies. They were heavily targeted by the Syndicalists, with several key figures, including former Liberal leader Herbert Samuel being jailed indefinitely. Liberal Action, a splinter from the SLRG and led by Megan Lloyd George, have a more radical, syndicalist-inclined ideology, and collaborated with the former Parliamentarian within the Labour Party before Mosley's consolidation of power. Today, both groups are supportive of the National Government and ambivalent on the question of Monarchy.§!"
ENG_market_liberal_party: "LNO"
ENG_market_liberal_party_long: "§LLiberal National Organisation\n§gAfter being banned by the Mann Government in 1932, the Liberal Party completely collapsed into various groups. The final form of a series of National Liberal, or 'Constitutionalist' groups during the Mosley period, the Liberal National Organisation are headed up by James Henderson-Stewart and Army Veteran John Selwyn Lloyd (before he was interned by Maximist Commissars in 1942 due to his ties to the National Liberal movement). Historically staunchly opposed to the 'Pro-Syndicalist' New Liberal groups, the LNO toes a liberal-conservative, laissez-faire line with prominent inclusion within the National Government, though tensions with their former allies have been slowly ameliorating since the Restoration.§!"
ENG_social_conservative_party: "Tories"
ENG_social_conservative_party_long: "§LTory Clubs and Societies\n§gAfter the Conservative Party leadership fled to the Canada during the British Revolution, their former party collapsed in months. Heavily oppressed by the victorious syndicalists in the years afterwards, the Tory remnants were divided into numerous cliques and underground clubs, devoid of widespread political influence. However, they are far from useless for the National Government, making up a new youthful grouping of promising Conservative modernisers with a unique perspective that Anthony Eden hopes will bolster a future Tory government.§!"
ENG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "National Government"
ENG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "§LNational Government\n§gWith the Reclamation War ending in the total internal collapse of the Union of Britain, a temporary government structure was needed to stabilise and rebuild the United Kingdom. To this end, King Edward VIII and Anthony Eden have opted to form a non-partisan National Government, with predominantly New Liberal, National Liberal and Conservative aligned representation, though controversially some former-Syndicalist defectors have been allowed into the appointed Provisional Parliament to bolster its legitimacy to the ex-syndicalist population. The broad front means that the ideology of the National Government is hard to pin down, other than a cadre of politicians working together to rebuild their country.§!"
ENG_paternal_autocrat_party: "Cliveden Set/CRGB"
ENG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "§LCliveden Set§!\n§LCommittee for the Restoration of Great Britain§!"
ENG_national_populist_party: "Empire League"
ENG_national_populist_party_long: "§LUnited Empire League§!"

### Later Parties ###
ENG_authsoc_unified_party: "Union Movement"
ENG_authsoc_unified_party_long: "§LUnion Movement\n§gThe Union Movement, the "Post-Maximist" organisation in the United Kingdom has moderated its views significantly to remain legal, having come to accept democracy. Their main ideological tenets are federal pan-Europeanism (though the sincerity of Europe a Nation is questionable) and a complete rejection of capitalist economics, instead advocating for a planned economy to rapidly rebuild Britain's economy to act as a model for other post-syndicalist nations to follow. Under the guidance of Hamm, the group has taken on a more xenophobic and antisemitic ideology than the Maximists of old.§!"
ENG_radsoc_unified_party: "CWGB"
ENG_radsoc_unified_party_long: "§LCommon Wealth Party of Great Britain\n§gFounded from the Orthodox Syndicalist core and the rump Christian-Socialist contingent of the Labour Party, Common Wealth stands on three basic principles: "Common Ownership, Morality in Politics and Vital Democracy". Advocating for a reinvigorated syndicalist economic policy in the vein of Arthur Horner's proposed reforms before Mosley's takeover, the party has moderated on other views to preserve their legality, including a commitment to reform rather than revolution and a preservation of the parliamentary system (though one with sweeping reforms). The party, as expected, has proved rather popular in the syndicalist heartlands of Britain, and is facing increasing scrutiny from MI5 to reduce their influence in national politics.§!"
ENG_democratic_labour_party: "Democratic-Labour"

### National Focuses ###

### Reconstruction Tree ###
ENG_the_kings_speech: "The King's Speech"
ENG_the_kings_speech_desc: "For twenty-two years we prepared, fought, and died for a Britain free from syndicalism and its oppression. We fought for our rightful King, His Majesty Edward VIII. Those who fell in the name of King and Country succeeded in their aim. We have finally returned to our native soil, and for the first time in over two decades, the King once more speaks to his people..."
ENG_organise_the_national_government: "Organise the National Government"
ENG_organise_the_national_government_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Mosley government in late '47, the isles has effectively had no government. We, the returning exiles, must show our ability to run the nation once more, and to restore relations with the citizens that have been exposed to syndicalist propaganda."
ENG_lingering_resistance: "Lingering Resistance"
ENG_lingering_resistance_desc: "Syndicalist remnants run rampant in Britain. The deep scars of a revolution, 22 years of syndicalist lunacy, and a 7 year war has left our land riddled with syndicalist militias and terrorists. To combat this threat, we must raise loyalist militias to keep order and fight these terrorists."
ENG_begin_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"
ENG_begin_reconstruction_desc: "After 8 years of all-out warfare and nuclear detonation of Portsmouth, Britain has been left in complete ruins. Poverty runs rampant in the nation, and the collapse of the syndicalist economic model has only escalated this. We must begin reconstruction!"
ENG_return_of_the_lords: "Return of the Aristocracy"
ENG_return_of_the_lords_desc: "Now we have finally established the United Kingdom once more, we ought to announce that Britain is at last welcoming to the aristocracy. Those who had to flee in the face of syndicalist mobs shall be exiles no longer! Their return shall herald the return of Britain as it should be, free under His Majesty Edward VIII."
ENG_reopen_parliament: "Reopen Parliament"
ENG_reopen_parliament_desc: "We pursued this war so that liberal democracy might finally return to the British Isles. Central to this belief was the idea that once the war was once, the Commons and the Lords would finally be open for session once more. The parliament-in-exile shall return to Westminster, to once more lead the nation."
ENG_firearms_and_paramilitaries_debate: "Firearms & Paramilitaries Debate"
ENG_firearms_and_paramilitaries_debate_desc: "An important debate has cropped up in the Commons; that of firearms and paramilitaries. Whilst paramilitaries could be used to keep order in our land, many MPs feel a certain aversion to using common thugs to keep order in a regime meant to be one of the people. The same issue comes with firearms, where some would say that they need to be banned to keep order, others say this ban would be ineffective and push more people in the arms of the resistance. Either way, a choice must be made."
ENG_fate_of_the_unions: "Fate of the Unions"
ENG_fate_of_the_unions_desc: "One of the big topics of the day within the government is what the fate of the trade unions should be. They were a pillar of the Socialist regime, with many clamoring that their future activities should be constrained if they are to participate within the new Britain, and yet if we outlawed them in their entirety, the country could fall into complete collapse. We must steer the ship carefully, for the sake of not repeating the mistakes on '25..."
ENG_filling_legal_gap: "Filling the Legal Gap"
ENG_the_constitutional_debates: "The Governmental Debates"
ENG_the_constitutional_debates_desc: "The British political system and government is one of the most resilient and adaptable ones there is. However, said system's catastrophic failure two decades ago have brought many of the old British government's failures under question; and now, we are in a position to deal with said failures, and possibly further bridge the gap between our government and the people."
ENG_reform_the_parties: "Reform the Parties"
ENG_reform_the_parties_desc: "Britain's politics were changed beyond recognition by the revolution, and the nation and the parties were divided into those who supported the revolution, and those who would fight to the death to keep Britain as it was in the past. Now the revolution has finally been quelled, and the exiles have returned, a new set of parties must be built, in order to truly launch the United Kingdom into the modern age."
ENG_new_british_government: "The New British Government"
ENG_new_british_government_desc: "The New British Government"
ENG_end_the_syndicalist_menace: "End the Syndicalist Menace"
ENG_end_the_syndicalist_menace_desc: "Having landed back onto the isles, what we expected was a resounding acceptance of His Majesty back at the helm, steering the ship of the British Empire. That however, was unfortunately merely idealistic thinking in retrospect.\n\nWith our homecoming has come the necessity to put down our fellow Britons. It has come clear we must get our hands dirty if we are to snuff out the Syndicalist menace in its cradle, once and for all."
ENG_establish_the_birmingham_trials: "Establish the Birmingham Trials"
ENG_establish_the_birmingham_trials_desc: "Whilst some more radical officials in the Cabinet and Civil Service advocate for public executions to show a clear message to those who remain fond of the former syndicalist regime, more sound minds in the administration have prevailed with another, more humane plan: to host these criminals on public trials.\n\nOf course the ball will be in our court with regards to the sentencing, and whilst the evidence will be presented fairly, the prosecution are fairly assured of their guilty from the jury. Additionally though, humiliating these syndicalists and giving the impression of a democratic process will give the cabinet legitimacy to the British public."
ENG_totalism_on_trial: "Maximism on Trial"
ENG_totalism_on_trial_desc: "Maximism was the cancerous ideology at the heart of the Union of Britain. It turned a leftist republic into a warmongering belligerent state. While we have little pity for the revolutionaries, we can distinguish between those who actively destroyed Britain, who helped and actively pursued destruction with ideological vigour and vim.\n\nThe trials will stand as a testament against their madness, and provide the grounds for the prosecution and eradication of this wicked ideology."
ENG_punish_all_syndicalists: "Punish All Syndicalists"
ENG_punish_all_syndicalists_desc: "There is no difference between one Syndicalist and another. The only difference between them and the Maximalists is they professed merely to be more moderate. They still fought against the British Monarchy and still would love to see us gone again.\n\nThere is no question here that the Syndicalists must all be punished. They are all guilty after all. Their political system gave no leeway for misdemeanors or worse - merely punished on guilt or innocence. We shall return the favour."
ENG_the_tribunal_ends: "The Tribunal Ends"
ENG_the_tribunal_ends_desc: "The Tribunal Ends"
ENG_crimes_against_civilization: "Crimes Against Civilisation"
ENG_crimes_against_civilization_desc: "Crimes Against Civilisation"
ENG_form_the_BLUE: "Form the B.L.U.E"
ENG_form_the_BLUE_desc: "The Maximist regime is dead and its higher-ups are dead or imprisoned, but regimes require more than just the higher-ups to survive. And we cannot allow former Maximist personnel to thrive in our administration and society – no sir! To this end, we will form the B.L.U.E – British Loyalists Uncovering Extremism – Bureau, to properly vet as many of these people as possible, so that only the clean or minimally tainted can prosper without sanctions."
ENG_hunt_down_the_BPLA: "Hunt Down the B.P.L.A"
ENG_hunt_down_the_BPLA_desc: "The war is over, but some people apparently haven't gotten the message, or closed themselves to it. Reports of a Mosleyite resistance group called the British People's Liberation Army have surfaced – and we haven't fought so hard just to let Britain fall to revolution again, have we now?"
ENG_the_red_book: "Open The Red Book"
ENG_the_red_book_desc: "The B.L.U.E Bureau is doing its job in vetting much of the lower former Maximist personnel, and the higher-ups are being punished.... this still leaves the problem of the middle personnel unanswered however. Enter the Red Book – a ledger of such \"in-betweener\" syndicalists, that we will keep updating. Whomsoever will have their name therein will face restrictions upon any future public activity, and will be scrutinized more in the future."
ENG_the_forever_eyes_programme: "The Forever Eyes Programme"
ENG_the_forever_eyes_programme_desc: "Collaboration was key to the Liberation of Britain, and the domain of intelligence is no exception. And now, with the world changing, we see no reason to abandon either our allies or our advances in intelligence gathering. Let us create the Forever Eyes Programme; an intelligence sharing program with our main allies, which would better allow us to coordinate with them, and keep whatever lingering pro-Maximist sentiment there is under control."
ENG_loyalist_propaganda: "Loyalist Propaganda"
ENG_loyalist_propaganda_desc: "The arms' war may be over, but the war for hearts and minds is not; and sadly the aftereffects of the Revolution's propaganda offensive still rest within many a Briton's heart. We must counteract this with propaganda of our own, extolling the Loyalist cause and hopefully leading many to repudiate the Union."
ENG_museums_to_totalist_terror: "Museums to Maximist Terror"
ENG_museums_to_totalist_terror_desc: "Although it is clear to a birds eye view of the sheer barbarity of the Maximist scum, there are still many in the lay population who still believe ritually the propaganda slogans of the previous Syndicalist regimes, which we should be forgiving, considering the extensive hijacking of people's minds for \"a better tomorrow\" when that tomorrow never would come. We shall show the Homeislanders what true freedom and justice is, through the construction of museums dedicated to the tragedy of the Maximists, for what is stronger than the still image of history being displayed outwardly, especially that which is articulated and constructed in our unadulterated view of it?"
ENG_officialise_rationing: "Officialise Rationing"
ENG_officialise_rationing_desc: "The people of Britain for years now have been suffering through shortages in many areas, especially food. Despite the vanquishing of the UoB we inherit these shortages and have been left to deal with them. So as we wait for agricultural production to resume, we need to implement an official rationing system to keep the people from further starving. It may be many years before rationing can end but it is a sacrifice we all must make."
ENG_prioritise_vital_industry: "Prioritise Vital Industry"
ENG_prioritise_vital_industry_desc: "\"Ah, British industry – colossal, ancient, and, as it stands now, a ruin. Disgraceful, yes, especially so given our status as a former industrial titan. Our resources, however limited they may be, must be focused on restarting our industrial sector first, starting with steel, machine parts, vehicle construction and consumer goods. Once our economic engine is roaring again, prosperity will follow suit."
ENG_department_of_reconstruction: "Department of National Reconstruction"
ENG_department_of_reconstruction_desc: "When we fled the Isles in 1925 we left behind a nation that was a mess. Now we return years later only to be greeted with ruins. Years of Syndicalist policies and our bombs have reduced what was once the ‘Workshop of the World' to nearly pre-industrial revolution levels. Roads are craters, bridges blown, railways ripped and towns wiped from the map, all needing to be rebuilt or replaced. \n\nIf this nation is to rise from her ashes a new department to organise this effort must be put together. Thus it will fall to the new Department of National Reconstruction to rebuild Britain to her former glory."
ENG_rearm_the_rsaf: "Rearm the Royal Small Arms Factory"
ENG_rearm_the_rsaf_desc: "Known as the ‘Republican Small Arms Factory' under syndicalist rule, the factories that made up it are little more than bombed-out husks. While some machinery has survived, the majority needed to get the factory operational again has been destroyed or sabotaged by the retreating Union forces. So to end our military reliance on arms imports, new tooling and equipment have been ordered while the factory walls are rebuilt and production lines reestablished. Once again small arms will be made in Britain in the name of His Majesty's forces and not Syndicalist scum. "
ENG_repair_london_dockyards: "Repair London's Docklands"
ENG_repair_london_dockyards_desc: "The Docklands of London, once a great hub of trade and commerce for our vanquished empire now lays in ruins, destroyed by forces both internal and external. The docks now lay in state in its black shroud, motionless and empty with wharves blown up, cranes destroyed and ships sunk blocking the Thames. \n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom, plans to rebuild and restore this vital artery of trade have been drafted and put forward to the Reconstruction Board. Once more London docks shall see ships from all corners of the globe return and bring with them vital resources and trade so desperately needed to rebuild our damaged nation. All we need to do now is sign off and begin the reconstruction of the docklands."
ENG_prioritise_vital_infrastructure: "Prioritise Vital Infrastructure"
ENG_prioritise_vital_infrastructure_desc: "While there are many issues needing our attention, the issue of vital infrastructure is currently plaguing attempts to deal with these problems. If we are to help the people we must first need an infrastructure base to at least act from."
ENG_the_royal_road_service: "The Royal Road Service"
ENG_the_royal_road_service_desc: "Roads and infrastructure are a bedrock of any country's development, and right now, British infrastructure is not in a good shape. With our resources in a tight spot, we must focus on repairing our infrastructure first; what good is getting production back on track if the transport routes are full of holes?"
ENG_british_rail: "New British Rail Service"
ENG_prison_service_contractor_initiative: "Prison Service Contractor Initiative"
ENG_prison_service_contractor_initiative_desc: "Prison Service Contractor Initiative"
ENG_fate_of_bletchley_park: "The Fate of Bletchley Park"
ENG_fate_of_bletchley_park_desc: "Ah, Bletchley Park; impressive achievement of cryptography, but the source of so many headaches during the war. No matter. It is in our hands now, and we get to decide what to do with it; do we shut it down and rebuild from scratch, or merely grant amnesty to some of the least politically tainted analysts and call it a day?"
ENG_reconstruction_of_portsmouth: "The Reconstruction of Portsmouth"
ENG_reconstruction_of_portsmouth_desc: "The Reconstruction of Portsmouth"
ENG_the_nuclear_memorial: "The Nuclear Memorial"
ENG_the_nuclear_memorial_desc: "It is regrettable that poor Portsmouth had to be the victim of a nuclear strike so that the Homecoming could have taken place. Scores of people died and scores more have suffered from its aftereffects. To start rebuilding bridges with Portsmouth, we can acknowledge their pain and build a memorial to the event. Lest we forget."
ENG_restore_buckingham_palace: "Restore Buckingham Palace"
ENG_restore_buckingham_palace_desc: "Buckingham – a name steeped in British formality and tradition. The King's old and current home, albeit HM the King can't live therein now due to the damage it sustained. A building so important to our nation must be restored – and with just a bit more impetus, we can finish said restoration ahead of schedule, and allow HM the King to return home at last."
ENG_the_new_city_programme: "The New City Programme"
ENG_the_new_city_programme_desc: "As disastrous as the current state of British cities is at the moment, we also have a brilliant opportunity on our hands – the chance to rebuild them even better than before. Wider streets, new sewer systems, slum clearances, vast green spaces, new housing; the future will look brighter than ever!"
ENG_use_old_plans: "Use the Old Plans"
ENG_use_old_plans_desc: "While the average British city is a bombed-out ruin at the moment, we cannot abandon architectural heritage and tradition in the name of getting it back on its feet as quickly as possible, we'd be no better than the Maximists if we did. It will be painstaking, but future generations will thank us for rebuilding our towns as they were – well, with the creature comforts of modernity attached of course."
ENG_the_relocation_authority: "Return of the Exiles"
ENG_the_relocation_authority_desc: "The torment has ended! Our people scattered over the globe, desperate, leaderless, starved, have emerged victorious. The thousands who had fled by sea, all can begin to return. While many may find their homeland has changed greatly since the dark days of 1925, we will still welcome Britannia's lost children home finally. \n\nHowever there is the issue of these exiles and their families still claiming their lost or seized properties and homes, many now home to new families since their former owners fled. While these exiles board their ships home, this issue of where they will return to and their former properties shall have to be dealt with quickly, or we may face significant backlash from our greatest sponsors and more from current residents should this not be resolved."
ENG_open_the_floodgates: "Open the Floodgates"
ENG_open_the_floodgates_desc: "Open the Floodgates"
ENG_the_beveridge_report: "The Beveridge Report"
ENG_the_beveridge_report_desc: "The Beveridge Report"
ENG_nationalise_our_assets: "Keep Key Industry Nationalised"
ENG_nationalise_our_assets_desc: "Even as we continue to reintroduce the market economy back to Britain, we have been getting reports that a few key industries should remain under government administration, especially the railways and energy sector. And their arguments certainly are compelling."
ENG_free_the_markets: "Expand the Privatization Drive"
ENG_free_the_markets_desc: "The invisible hand of the market is the ultimate winnower of good and bad companies; and we must not hold back from rebuilding the British economy on the basis of the free market. Yes, there will be closures as less efficient industries give way, sure. But technology means we can produce more with less factories – less colossi, but more efficient ones. Ideal for our modern economy, unencumbered by the weighty old works."
ENG_the_spirit_of_the_union_jack: "The Spirit of the Union Jack"
ENG_the_spirit_of_the_union_jack_desc: "The Spirit of the Union Jack"
ENG_leave_no_brick_unturned: "Leave No Brick Unturned"
ENG_leave_no_brick_unturned_desc: "Potholes are being filled, brick and rubble mounds are vanishing from the streets, glass shards are disappearing – yes, Reconstruction is going along swimmingly. One final effort is all we'll need before we can declare this initial phase of rebuilding Britain finished. Whatever signs of ruin and decay there still are, we will clear them away."

ENG_prepare_the_general_election_desc: "Prepare for the General Election!"
ENG_continue_the_national_government: "Continue the National Government"
ENG_continue_the_national_government_desc: "Continue the National Government"

### Military Tree ###
ENG_ministry_of_defense: "Form the Ministry of Defence"
ENG_ministry_of_defense_desc: "Having taken back our birthright, a sickening new disease has slowly creeped up to replace the syndicalist dogma, the mantra of pacifism, with thousands of so-called activists demanding not another war, not realising they are merely playing into the hands of the enemy, who desires a Britain that is weak and nimble.\n\nHaving a tradition of defending our isles from external threats on the continent, establishing a dedicated Ministry of Defence will guarantee a well coordinated doctrine on the use of military equipment and the best way in which to tackle potential threats that may arise in the future, and although unpopular with the masses of people, so to was there opposition to the magna carta, and that is the duty of our government: to push the hard, but necessary deeds. "
ENG_chief_of_general_staff: "The Chief of the General Staff"
ENG_chief_of_general_staff_desc: "No amount of men, equipment, or technology determines who shall win the battle, if the man that leads such an army is a bumbling buffoon or nearsighted, such as was the largely outnumbered, but tactically genius march of Hannibal's men through the Italian alps.\n\nWith this in mind, we shall assign such a great man to lead our men, not just through numerical advantage, but through cunningness that will bewilder and outmatch our opponents, whether it be the winding Rhine basin or the treacherous Alpine alps."
ENG_hardings_army: "Harding's Army"
ENG_hardings_army_desc: "The experienced general John Harding considers that the future of the British Army is a tried-and-true mobile force centered on the infantry, acting in conjunction with the armored troops and the air force to overwhelm the enemy. It may seem like an aging concept, but it is an adaptable one; one which Gen. Harding may just modernize."
ENG_keightleys_army: "Keightley's Army"
ENG_keightleys_army_desc: "General Charles Keightley's concept of the modern British Army hinges heavily on the main battle tank; these behemoths of the battlefield that, with proper adjustment, can and should become the centrepiece of our armed forces; compensating for numerical inferiority through good old-fashioned British technological superiority."
ENG_gales_army: "Gale's Army"
ENG_gales_army_desc: "General Richard Gale, instrumental in developing our paratrooper corps, considers that the future of the British Army lies in its powerful special forces; though few in number, these highly-trained men can punch way above their station. With investment, can become the lynchpin of a force that will swiftly reach and destroy any foe."
ENG_question_of_syndicalist_officers: "The Question of Syndicalist Officers"
ENG_question_of_syndicalist_officers_desc: "The important question of the day is what to do with the traitorous officers, who although having betrayed the nation, do, admittedly, have remarkable military talents, we must face the reality that we might need to appropriate these talents for our cause, and to exonerate these former rats to serve the right cause."
ENG_adopt_the_em2: "Adopt the Rifle No.9"
ENG_adopt_the_em2_desc: "The venerable Lee Enfield has served us and the Commonwealth admirably for years now. However, even the most distinguished of weapons must eventually give way to new innovations.\n\nEnter the Rifle No.9. Developed during the war, this semi-automatic rifle utilises a bullpup configuration, placing the action and magazine behind the trigger, allowing for a shorter overall length without sacrificing barrel length. This new rifle offers improved firepower and accuracy over the longer and more physically demanding bolt action Lee Enfields.\n\nSo as the Enfield is phased out we can only hope the No.9 lives up to its predecessor's legacy. "
ENG_focus_on_soldiers: "Focus on the Soldier"
ENG_focus_on_soldiers_desc: "What is an army made up of? Most people nowadays just see the army as a bunch of indistinguishable soldiers with helmets, boots, guns and bullets, but irrefutably an army is made up of men, who go into service knowing the risks, but more importantly, their duty to serve and protect their nation from the enemy, and unfortunately many past governments have, rather incredulously, ignored the men in uniforms for their bravery.\n\nRecognising this blind-sightedness, we shall give new light to the new man, the ideal man, and promote the iconography of the soldier that will save the nation from the downtrodden and wretched foreign bodies that seek to undermine the nation's very spirit, for lest we forget the sacrifices of the previous generations in securing Britain in her current form."
ENG_create_the_centurion: "Create the Centurion"
ENG_create_the_centurion_desc: "From their beginnings in the First Weltkrieg and their massive development during the second, tanks have come far, and must go farther still, even as we dread a Third Weltkrieg. Building off this progress, we will develop a tank better than all of its predecessors, to serve as the spearhead and spine of the modern British Army."
ENG_develop_new_strategies: "Developing New Strategies"
ENG_develop_new_strategies_desc: "The saying goes that no plan survives first contact with the enemy. It may be true, but this doesn't mean we shouldn't make them anyway, if only as a blueprint from which to develop from. Considering that we are centering our armed forces on the special services, our new strategies must be up to par to best make use of this small, but strong force."
ENG_rebuild_the_reserves: "Rebuild the Territorial Army"
ENG_rebuild_the_reserves_desc: "The Territorial Army, our reserve force, has been decimated by the Second Weltkrieg owing to the casualties incurred during the Homecoming. Nevertheless, we must persevere, and make it an appealing option to our shell-shocked people, so that we may have a reserve ready in times of need, especially should our Navy fall."
ENG_new_staff_colleges: "New Staff Colleges"
ENG_new_staff_colleges_desc: "As our army continues to rebuild and adapt to the changing times, we must make sure that our officer corps not only is replenished, but that it remains among the world's finest. To this end we must replenish and educate our officer corps; and to aid in this effort, we will spin off a separate staff college for the RAF, and bring them all together under the umbrella of the new Royal Joint Service Command College, for greater coordination."
ENG_continue_montys_model: "Continue the 'Montgomery Model'"
ENG_continue_montys_model_desc: "Field Marshal Montgomery's military thought has served us well in the liberation of the Home Isles, and it will continue to be useful in the postwar period, even as nuclear weapons make conventional warfare unlikely. By continuing his work and focus on combined arms warfare, air superiority, maneuver, innovation and casualty conservation, the Army will remain a force to be reckoned with, even without the Empire at its back."
ENG_expand_the_paras: "Expand the Paras"
ENG_expand_the_paras_desc: "The Paratrooper Regiment has served with valor across the many battlefields of the Second Weltkrieg. Now, backed by the many technological advances made during and since the war, they stand poised to become the true elite of the British Army, a strike force capable of defeating our foes anywhere, at any time. Let no foe be outside our reach."
ENG_army_modernisation_campaign: "A Campaign of Modernisation"
ENG_army_modernisation_campaign_desc: "The Royal Navy, Britain's first line of defense, has seen better days. Divided against itself by the Revolution, fighting itself in the Second Weltkrieg... yet we must carry on, and rebuild this most British of institutions to modern standards, that no enemy may dare touch down on British soil."

ENG_frasers_navy: "Fraser's Navy"
ENG_frasers_navy_desc: "Admiral Bruce Fraser's vision for the modern Royal Navy is for a supportive force, integrated within the command structures of the Toronto Accord and working alongside our allies therein to secure the Atlantic. It may be a blow to our pride to downsize, but the days of Empire are behind us after all..."
ENG_mountbattens_navy: "Mountbatten's Navy"
ENG_mountbattens_navy_desc: "Admiral Louis Mountbatten's vision for the modern Royal Navy is a strong force, capable of independent and proactive operations across the world. Our allies are important, but we cannot become overly-dependent. Britannia shall rule the waves, even if said waves are just the Channel, the Atlantic, and the North and Irish Seas."
ENG_study_hortons_theories: "Study Horton's Theories"
ENG_study_hortons_theories_desc: "The story of Max Horton is a testament of Maximist inefficiencies. A brilliant submariner and naval officer, sidelined and purged by Mosley due to being of Jewish heritage. The Maximists are gone however, and while Horton himself isn't willing to reenter active duty, he agreed to pass along his ideas and notes on submarine warfare, and nuclear propulsion of said submarines..."
ENG_restructure_the_admiralty: "Restructure the Admiralty"
ENG_restructure_the_admiralty_desc: "An aging bureaucracy and the confusion of the past two decades have left the British Admiralty in a dire state; and if we are to restore the Royal Navy, this cannot be allowed to stand. The entire structure must be restructured and reformed, to serve the needs of a changing Britain in changing times."
ENG_build_a_new_royal_navy: "Building the Second Royal Navy"
ENG_build_a_new_royal_navy_desc: "The Oxford Treaty has been, by and large, circumvented following Operation Avalon. Now, the time has time to rebuild our once glorious navy as we see fit. It will take years, potentially decades, but the grand shipbuilding project that awaits us will serve as a lucrative employment opportunity (albeit a somewhat costly one). Nonetheless, the People and the Admiralty are united behind this new beginning.\n\nSi vis pacem, para bellum."
ENG_syndicalist_naval_vets: "Integrate Red Veterans?"
ENG_syndicalist_naval_vets_desc: "In comparison to the fanatically Maximist Republican Army and Air Force, the Republican Navy is of note in its rather anti-Maximist stance during the war. With many admirals, captains, and sailors expressing their disdain for the Mosley government and the subsequent purges from it, we may be able to gain valuable insight and experience from its veterans who have already fought the Germans. \n\nWhile some within the military are concerned about reintegrating former enemies, the benefits from their experiences outweigh these concerns in preparing our forces for future conflict."
ENG_overhaul_naval_yards: "Overhaul Naval Yard Facilities"
ENG_overhaul_naval_yards_desc: "Discussions on the Royal Navy's future are pointless without applying the results of said discussions into reality – namely, building new ships and refitting old ones. Regardless of whatever doctrine we adopt, we will require a fleet for the future. And a fleet for the future requires dockyards to match."
ENG_purchase_allied_ships: "Purchase Allied Ships"
ENG_purchase_allied_ships_desc: "You can't have a navy if you don't have any ships, a situation we're currently in. Unfortunately, most captured Republican Navy ships have been scrapped, seized by other nations, or are no longer fit for service giving us little to build upon. So until our shipbuilding facilities are restored, we will have to look to our allies to purchase ships from."
ENG_develop_supportive_task_forces: "Constructing "Design Z" Crusiers"
ENG_develop_supportive_task_forces_desc: "In the latter stages of the war, the Union of Britain came up with their ultimate cruiser concept: the "Design Z", a somewhat-overgunned light cruiser that would be much cheaper to build than old-fashioned dreadnoughts, while packing a serious punch against air and sea targets. The design specifications for the "Design Z" were picked up by the National Government after Mosley's fall, and after further modernisations the Admiralty has ordered a series of these ships to flesh out our new navy."
ENG_fleet_for_the_accord: "A Fleet for the Accord"
ENG_fleet_for_the_accord_desc: "In spite of the grumblings of many nostalgics, we have managed to reform the Royal Navy into a sleek and supple elite fighting force, fighting ship to ship besides our allies in the Toronto Accord. No enemy may dare challenge our allies' position in the Atlantic with the New Navy on the watch."
ENG_fleet_for_the_nation: "A Fleet for a Nation"
ENG_fleet_for_the_nation_desc: "It has been tough, and it is smaller than its heyday, but the Royal Navy once more stands as a force ready to project power across the world on its own merits. We are not merely a link in our alliance's chain, but a lynchpin thereof. Let every Briton be proud, for even after two world wars, Britannia shall stand astride the waves forever and a day."
ENG_embrace_the_carrier_age: "Developing "Cruiser-Carriers""
ENG_embrace_the_carrier_age_desc: "Though the Oxford Treaty has been largely voided due to recent events, Germany's attention on our fleet remains. Though an arms race now exists between us once again, we cannot threaten a war over a ship! As a work-around to the Treaty's naval clauses, a new type of light, mobile carrier called "Crusier-Carriers" will be put into production. Germany can be annoyed at our ingenuity, but legally they have no standing to intervene."
ENG_pride_of_the_fleet: "The Pride of the Fleet"
ENG_pride_of_the_fleet_desc: "No fleet is complete without its flagship, least of all the Royal Navy. While we could designate an already-existing vessel as such, this can be a temporary solution at best. Our flagship must represent the finest that British ingenuity can muster; let us lay down a brand new carrier for this purpose. Only the finest for Britain's finest!"

ENG_rebuild_the_RAF: "Copy "The Plan""
ENG_rebuild_the_RAF_desc: ""
ENG_renovate_airfields: "Renovate Mosley's Airfields"
ENG_renovate_airfields_desc: "The multitude of airfields and airstrips built by the Maximists for their Republican Air Force are yet another aspect of the Red regime that we cannot just throw away owing to sheer utility. We'll repair and renovate them, and they will be ready for use for the Royal Air Force in no time."
ENG_perfect_the_jet_engine: "Perfect the Jet Engine"
ENG_perfect_the_jet_engine_desc: "The jet engine, altough prototypical at the moment, is a marvel of engineering. And with more investment, we can refine it and complete what the Maximists started. We stand at the precipice of achieving a breakthrough in aeronautical engineering, and gaining a leg up on our competitors. Let us boldly step forth, and usher in the Jet Age."
ENG_appropriate_syndicalist_designs: "Appropriate Syndicalist Prototypes"
ENG_appropriate_syndicalist_designs_desc: "Many things can be said about the Syndicalists, but they didn't have a shortage of talented minds and engineers. We have come across many blueprints and prototypes of advanced warplanes. Our engineers will have a field day studying them and their potential, and seeing what can be drawn from their experiments. After all, Mosley's not around to complain, is he?"
ENG_modern_RADAR: "Modernise Maximist RADAR Instillations"
ENG_modern_RADAR_desc: "While we may antagonise the Maximist military for its brutality, its system of RADAR installations however was certainly forward-thinking. However, most installations have been destroyed or now lay abandoned since our takeover.\nBut with the Kalterkrieg heating up and worries of a second Blitz from the Germans across the channel, the Ministry of Defence is looking at the possibility of reactivating and modernizing these installations to help defend our reclaimed isles."
ENG_offensive_airforce: "Offensive Aerial Orientation"
ENG_offensive_airforce_desc: "The wonders of the jet engine are leading to a rapid increase in aircraft speed. If only we had this advantage, it would be wonderful, but we don't. Therefore, we must adapt our doctrine accordingly, centering it on speed and preemptive strikes. It is said that the best defense is the offense, and destroying the enemy air force before it takes off is an easy way to assure air superiority."
ENG_defensive_airforce: "The European Air-Shield"
ENG_defensive_airforce_desc: "Mantaining our troops and airframes is paramount for a country such as ours, especially coming off the heels of the World Wars. A defensive aerial strategy as such is the best bet; why waste our men in risky offensives when we can draw the enemy into our allies' airspace, whittle them down to size and counterattack when the time is right? Our friends in Europe can rest easily beneath the Royal Air Force's aerial shield."


###Diplomacy Tree###

ENG_joining_the_kalterkrieg: "Joining the Kalterkrieg"
ENG_joining_the_kalterkrieg_desc: "Britain's place is not on the sidelines, nor should we be ever said to be fearful of stating our mind. It is time for Britain to step into the Kalterkrieg and declare her principles for one and all to see."
ENG_accept_the_new_britain: "Accept the New Britain"
ENG_accept_the_new_britain_desc: "It is perhaps a painful thought for some, but we must be realistic. Britain's empire is not going to be coming back in any form that it's previous masters would recognise. Nor should we desire it, as it would be reactionary and useless to seek redress. We no longer live in an age of Imperialism, but one of armed camps."
ENG_legitimise_diplomatic_offices: "Legitimise Diplomatic Missions"
ENG_legitimise_diplomatic_offices_desc: "While we are masters of statecraft, loquaciousness and pedantry, vital components of the diplomatic game, the crux of the matter is that diplomacy is idle prattle without diplomats. Fortunately, we are in no shortage of them; our shortages lie in diplomatic missions abroad where they can ply their trade. Let us remedy this."
ENG_royal_commonwealth_institute: "Create the Royal Commonwealth Institute"
ENG_royal_commonwealth_institute_desc: "Besides giving a place for the world's brightest minds to gather and discuss, learned societies also play a vital role in the projection of soft power. While the old Royal Colonial Institute may have perished in the fires of revolution, we can reconstitute it as the Royal Commonwealth Institute, to promote the bonds between New Britain and her associates"
ENG_our_seat_at_the_table: "Our Seat at The Table"
ENG_our_seat_at_the_table_desc: "Our gratefulness to Canada for hosting the Government in Exile will last in all perpetuity. With that state of affairs having been resolved with the Homecoming, however, the time has come for Britain to retake her seat at the Great Powers' table. We will assert our right to vote over the Accord's resolutions, and make it clear that Britain will not be ignored, even as the axis of power shifts westwards into the Atlantic."
ENG_the_london_conference: "The London Conference"
ENG_the_london_conference_desc: "The maturity shown by the Dominions in matters of self-governance during the Homeland's time of need have astonished us, as well as the other colonies' valiant efforts. Such efforts deserve a reward – to this end, we will call a conference, to reorganise what little technically remains of the Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations – an association of independent, free and equal states, bound to us through history and culture"
ENG_secure_commonwealth_interests: "Secure Commonwealth Interests "
ENG_secure_commonwealth_interests_desc: ""
ENG_cooperate_with_the_irish: "Cooperation with the Irish"
ENG_cooperate_with_the_irish_desc: "Recent warming of relations with the Irish following the Ulster Conference and the Irish entry into the Accord has opened the door to economic cooperation between our two nations. We should take advantage of this opportunity to link our economies together and share in prosperity."
ENG_fate_of_mann: "The Fate of Man"
ENG_fate_of_mann_desc: "The Isle of Man has, for ages, been an administrative peculiarity due to its status as a Crown Dependency – not part of the United Kingdom, but dependent on it for defence and foreign relations. After the Homecoming, these prerogatives have passed on to Canada. And now that we are secure on our island once more, we should assume them once more."
ENG_commonwealth_investment_campaigns: "The Commonwealth Industries Association"
ENG_commonwealth_investment_campaigns_desc: "With the successful formation of the Commonwealth of Nations, various ministers from across it are now suggesting we go one step further, forming a shared industrial committee: the Commonwealth Industries Association. The Association will help pool funding from all member nations for various projects, forging ever-closer bonds between us."

ENG_form_home_affairs_buerau: "Scale Up the Home Office"
ENG_form_home_affairs_buerau_desc: "This new war will not be fought primarily with gun and vessel, but through subterfuge and deception. We know it and the enemy knows it as well. To maintain order at home and ensure counterintelligence duty is carried out efficiently, the Home Office –alongside its cloaked arm, the MI5-, must be reformed and upscaled like never before. Let Britain rest securely beneath the Office's watchful eyes."
ENG_expand_the_SIS: "Expand the SIS"
ENG_expand_the_SIS_desc: "To be effective, foreign espionage requires coordination. We already have a structure in place to this end, the Secret Intelligence Service, lovingly dubbed the MI6; however its capacity at the moment may be unsatisfactory to properly tackle the German Goliath. Fortunately, we are in a position to greatly expand its capabilities, which we shall carry out post-haste."
ENG_censor_german_media: "Introduce Germanic Censorship"
ENG_censor_german_media_desc: "We may have worked together during the war, but Teutonic duplicity is only proving that Britain cannot be safe with a continental hegemon such as Germany. To prevent sympathies towards the rival –and any fifth column- from arising, German media must be thoroughly filtered before it reaches our public. Some may call it a First Weltkrieg-era anachronism, but such is the way of things – the old is new and new is old."
ENG_operation_avalon: "Operation Avalon"
ENG_operation_avalon_desc: "Ah, the Treaty of Oxford, that accursed text of Teutonic treachery! The Germans may think themselves clever by limiting how many men we can muster and by forcing us to pay them reparations for things that the Maximists – not us!- have done! Let us not despair however – we will shake these reviled shackles off, slowly but surely. No matter what it takes, Britain will be free."
ENG_embed_agents_in_reichspakt: "Embed Agents in the Reichspakt"
ENG_embed_agents_in_reichspakt_desc: "There are two sides to every coin – defence and offence, counterespionage and espionage. With our homefront secure, and the SIS expanded, we can start going on the offensive on the intelligence struggle. Our agents will fan out, and we will have eyes and ears from Paris all the way to Kiev."
ENG_restart_anti_german_propaganda: "Restart Anti-German Propaganda"
ENG_restart_anti_german_propaganda_desc: "Simply censoring whatever the Germans produce in the realms of culture doesn't suffice – if we are to win the cultural struggle against them, we must also make sure that there is as little incentive to consume their films and music as possible. We will polish up some older First Weltkrieg-era material, as well as using our experiences since to produce new... public notices, and soon enough no patriotic Briton will admit liking Babelsberg."
ENG_rearming_britain: "Establish the DAG"
ENG_rearming_britain_desc: "Rebuilding the British Army as a fighting force requires more than doctrinal debates and flounting German military restrictions. Specifically, it requires armaments. Firearms, artillery, and in great amounts. To this end, we will create the Defence Action Group, to coordinate and manage our rearming efforts."
ENG_fighting_with_the_pound: "Fighting with the Pound"
ENG_fighting_with_the_pound_desc: "Money and commerce are the fundaments of prosperity and power, as well as a useful tool for projecting influence. Did our Empire not start off out of a desire to expand our commercial position? While those days may be over, this basic truth about coin is unchanged, and we will weaponize it once more - through careful investment, the pound sterling shall take on the German mark abroad, and where our coins will go, our influence shall follow."
ENG_raise_defence_spending: "Raise Defence Spending"
ENG_raise_defence_spending_desc: "The sinews of war are infinite money, as the saying goes. Infinite money would surely be useful, given that armaments are becoming more and more expensive and the international situation is extremely delicate. Sadly, we cannot have infinite money, but we can make do by allocating more money towards defence in the National Budget."
ENG_invest_into_the_armouries: "Invest into the Arms Factories"
ENG_invest_into_the_armouries_desc: "The British armaments industry must not only work harder to remain competitive on the world stage and to supply our brave men, but also smarter. Producing mid-century weaponry with Weltkrieg-era technology is needlessly cumbersome and inefficient; let us proceed to earmark block grants for retechnologization for the Royal Ordnance Factories."
ENG_lynchpin_of_the_atlantic: "The Lynchpin of the Atlantic"
ENG_lynchpin_of_the_atlantic_desc: "The days of Empire may be over, but it matters little – for we have successfully adapted our position – already one to be envied due to our island - to the new strategic realities. Let all enemies of the Toronto Accords tremble, and let the Germans huff and puff – for jolly old Britain is back, and we'll never let the banner of the Accord fall!"

ENG_demlab_1950_finish_desyndicalisation_desc: "The De-Syndicalisation policies put in place by the National Government weren't just a mistake, they were an outrage. Rather than 'calming a divided nation', De-Syndicalisation only served to divide it further. Today, people suspected of being loyal to 'the revolution' are unfairly discriminated, and the lives of people who only ever knew the Union of Britain have been devestated.\n\nWe need to work to reintegrate the workers and radicals back into Britain, not cast them out.

ENG_demlab_1950_danger_of_revolution_desc: "If the Union of Britain showed us anything, it was that even the most idealistic revolution can, and in many cases will, degrade into nepotism and populism. It is imperative that we distance ourselves from the British Labour movement of old, and instead forge a new reformist path, one that respects our national identity and institutions whilst still uplifting the workers of Britain.\n\nFor many within Democratic-Labour, this will be a path alien to their experiences and ideals, but none the less it is one we must undertake."

ENG_return_of_the_king_desc: "At long last, after decades of Syndicalist & Maximist tyranny, the Crown has returned back to its true home, the British Isles. The suffering has now ended, it is now time to heal and rejoice. Long Live the King! Rule Britannia!"
ENG_legacy_of_the_maximists: "Legacy of the Maximists"
ENG_legacy_of_the_maximists_desc: "The tyrannical Oswald Mosley, who led Britain for over 11 horrifying years, is dead. He was killed by his own countrymen, but even in death his twisted legacy lives on. The Second Weltkrieg has left the Isles drained and broken. Countless young men have died, countless more have been irreversibly scarred by the horrors of war. A general sense of hopelessness pervades our once glorious nation and any remaining militarism was washed away by nuclear flame. The terror he inflicted will never be forgotten."
ENG_syndicalist_resistance_modifier: "Syndicalist Resistance"
ENG_syndicalist_resistance_modifier_desc: "Though we have secured nominal control across Britain, in reality our liberation is far from absolute. Across the country, syndicalist militias & terror groups are quickly making meaningful governance a living hell. Much of our population is openly hostile to our rule, and it will take years before this unrest can be calmed. If we don't tread carefully, we could even see an outright rebellion."

ENG_aftermath_of_the_blitz: "Aftermath of the Blitz"
ENG_aftermath_of_the_blitz_desc: "For nearly 2 years, the British Isles were bombed into submission by both the Reichspakt and the Entente. Though surrender wasn't forced until the dastardly detonation of Heimdallr over Portsmouth, the damage had long been done. Britain's industry is a mess, our resources are scattered, and people are fleeing the country to greener pastures. Recovering from such destruction will not be a small feat; It will take years of dedicated rebuilding before we can move on."
ENG_lingering_german_occupation: "Lingering German Occupation"
ENG_lingering_german_occupation_desc: "In the chaos that was the Union of Britain's downfall, a German army lead by Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen landed & occupied the southern counties of England. Now, with the war over and order quickly being restored by Anthony Eden's National Government, they're reluctant to leave. Perhaps the Kaiser is hoping for concessions from us, revenge for the widespread destruction caused by the Mosley Regime. Whatever the reason, our loyalist army is overstretched enough as it is, trying to consolidate control over the Isles. So, even though their illegal occupation is making our nation even more difficult to govern, for now we cant force them to leave. "

### Reconstruction Ideas ###
ENG_aftermath_of_the_blitz_2: "Recovering from the Blitz"
ENG_aftermath_of_the_blitz_2_desc: "Its a slow and steady process, even slower than most of our professional estimates, but finally we are seeing signs of improvement in our economy and industry.

ENG_new_plan_rebuild: "Revamping the Cities"
ENG_new_plan_rebuild_desc: "The bombed out & syndicalised cities of Britain are being revamped according to an interpretation on the late Edwin Lutyen's "Imperial Plan".

### Shared Ideas ###
ENG_rationing: "Rationing Programmes"
ENG_rationing_desc: "After the brutality of the Second Weltkrieg, Britain has been left a weak nation on the verge of famine. While reconstruction commences, mandates have been instated to ration everything from food to fuel, in a bid to keep Britain's industry and livihoods ticking as we get back onto our feet. A question hangs over how long rationing will remain in place "
ENG_general_strike: "The [GetYear] General Strike"
ENG_general_strike_desc: "Following changes to Labour Laws, Britain has once again been paralysed by a General Strike. Industry has stopped, and public transport workers have also walked out. Parallels to the dark days of 1925 are obvious and terrifying to much of the country, and currently no one knows who will break first, the Government or the Strikers. Whatever the outcome, the government has been heavily discredited by the mistakes that led up to this new crisis."
ENG_post_restoration_consensus: "The Post-Restoration Consensus"
ENG_post_restoration_consensus_desc: "With its roots in the works of Liberals, Beveridge and Keynes, a common socio-economic consensus has emerged between all three major parties to stabilise and protect the restored United Kingdom. This consensus, consisting of the development of a mixed economy, establishing full employment and strong welfare programmes, has been erroneously likened to German 'State Socialism' in its goal of dampening the once revolutionary ideals of the British population. Detractors of the consensus have also complained that this convergence of policies mean the Liberals, Tories and even the Socialists all stand for the same points, though these radical agitators are few and far between."

### DemLab Ideas ###
ENG_demlab_distrusted_government: "Distrusted Government"
ENG_demlab_distrusted_government_desc: "We may have popular support, but a return of socialist government, so soon after the revolution was pacificed, has brought worry and concern to a nation barely holding itself together. The King, the Army and Westminster at large all watch our government like hawks, searching for any sign of traitorous tendancies. It will take many years for us to shake this climate of suspicion."
ENG_demlab_new_british_union: "The New British Union"
ENG_demlab_new_british_union_desc: "Trade Unions were always an important aspect of the British economy, and the Labour movement predominantly formed out of Trade Unionism. Perhaps it was these strong ties that led to the revolution that broke Britain. Just like Democratic-Labour had to evolve, the modern situation means it is necessary for Trade Unions to evolve too. No longer can they exist as cover for revolutionary cells, but rather they have to adopt reformist ideals if they wish to survive. The new British Federation of Trade Unions must stand for our core national values, and work with the government, not against it, to ensure workers rights are protected."
ENG_fighting_inflation: "Fighting Inflation"
ENG_fighting_inflation_desc: "We have recently implemented a short-term programme to constrict the monetary supply in order to get our inflation under control. While this is costly, it is an important step for us to take in order to avoid a wider cost of living crisis." #topical!
ENG_fair_wages: "Investigating Wage Practices"
ENG_fair_wages_desc: "Our government is undertaking a large-scale review of the wages that companies across Britain pay in order to make sure that no workers are being paid under a fair wage. This programme is an important step in our recovery, as there can be no national recovery if the workers are kept impoverished by the fat cats in the board room."

### Lib Ideas ###
ENG_liberals_finishing_the_fight: "Finishing the Fight"
ENG_liberals_finishing_the_fight_desc: "Unfortunately, the syndicalist tyranny that befell Britain during the Second Weltkrieg did not fully end with our victory, and it has not ended in the past few years, either. Syndicalist holdouts still hold on for dear life in more rural parts of the country. We must conduct an agressive program to deal with the last of the insurgents, for only then can we have true peace."

We mustn't let our pride with Capitalism blind us, and we must establish the most pragmatic policy that our administration has to offer - Nationalising the British Economy. Yes, the word itself isn't palatable to the average citizen, who sees the likes of Mosley and his Maximist goons whenever they hear the word "Nationalisation".

### Events ###
krg_eng.0.t: "An Empire No More"
krg_eng.0.d: "Britain, the world's first global superpower, once flew its flag in every corner of the globe. From the freezing tundra of Canada to the arid outback of Australia, Britain ruled them all. However, after the First Weltkrieg, Britain lost her position as the world's preeminent power, and in 1925 she lost everything else. \n\nThe British Revolution fractured the country and ripped the isles apart. After a decade of slowly fading leftist democracy, Oswald Mosley emerged in 1936 as the leader of this "New Britain".  Whilst Mosley was hawkish, he wasn't simply an embittered revanchist like many of his continental comrades in the Third Internationale. He advocated for a world revolution to purify the world of the reactionary hegemon. With this in mind, Mosley prepared his country for war.\n\nWhen the Second Weltkrieg began, Mosley believed this would be the moment of final European liberation. Galvanized by the fire of revolution and the lust for revenge, Internationale forces marched into Germany, ready to do everything in their power to defeat the Kaiser. But it was all in vain. The Reichspakt, and later the Entente, repelled the Internationale's initial push into Germany, and eventually Mosley's continental allies fell one by one, leaving a tattered Britain to face down the Kaiserreich alone once more. Mosley, however, remained adamant to continue the war, even as the Germans and Canadians relentlessly bombarded the isles during the 'Blitz'. For 18 months, terrible devastation was wrought upon the nation from the air, but Mosley still refused to surrender. Finally, as all other options were exhausted, the Kaiser authorised his secret weapon to be deployed; an atomic bomb, to be dropped on Portsmouth. \n\nThe largest explosion ever witnessed flattened the city and destroyed what was left of the Republican Navy. The Germans immediately invaded the south of the country, beginning a rampage of terror throughout the area. The Entente concurrently landed in the west, offering an end to the terrible suffering of Maximism and war. The British, exhausted, accepted, and the Union of Britain surrendered. Mosley attempted to escape the country but was caught by his people. 'The Grand Protector' was found dangling unceremoniously from a bridge in London, riddled with 15 bullet holes. On the 29th December 1947, quiet finally settled over Albion.\n\nWhile the war is finally over, Britain remains bruised and beaten. Syndicalism is still espoused by many, and the Kaiser's troops still linger in the south. It is up to the King, Edward VIII, to bring salvation to his people and prove he is worthy of his birthright or else Britain may find herself once more engulfed in flame..."

krg_eng.1.t: "The Political Situation today"
krg_eng.1.d: "To say the political situation of Britain is less than fortunate is merely an understatement, as it doesn't even begin to display the unstable situation here in Great Britain.\n\nFirstly, to say that Maximism and its subsets are eradicated is simply false. The threat of Maximism is actually worse than anticipated, as many still hold dear to the values and philosophies of Oswald Mosley and his band of terrorists. They contest the legitimacy of the new British government, and they are more than willing to hinder, halt, or even reverse any and all decisions that this new government has created.\n\nSecondly, to say that the people want Democracy here is true, but not under the guiding hand of the King. Many within Britain don't conform to the beliefs of Maximism, yet they most certainly don't want the Crown back in the Isles. After all, in their mind, the Crown \"abandoned\" them and fed them to the Maximist wolves, who preach their ideas of revolution and at the same time, repress them with an iron fist.\n\nAnd Thirdly, the idea of the Democratic system restored in Britain. Given the situation in the Isles, Democracy cannot and will not be a reality here for the foreseeable future, as allowing a new General Election is merely asking these radical organizations to revolt against us. No, for Democracy to gain ground, we would have to install a \"National Government\", one that holds special authority to govern the isles, and one that will ensure that these threats to British Democracy will be stomped from the face of the earth, even if it may be undemocratic to some.\n\nHowever, the question lies to this - How long will this National Government last? Or rather if it will achieve its goals at all?"
krg_eng.1.a: "Ah yes, politics of reconstruction and rebellion, great..."

krg_eng.2.t: "Brief about the German Occupation"
krg_eng.2.d: "Of course, the Kaiser wouldn't just let our isles go now will they? After all, the blood they spilled to remove the Totalists from Europe had to amount to something, or else the conflict was nothing more than an unnecessary loss of life.\n\nThis \"something\" was the deployment of German divisions in our southern counties in the chaos of the wars end, commanded by Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen. Officially, they do not hold any administrative position nor have the authority to do so. Yet, they have no sovereign right to be here, and have already delved into \"law enforcement\" within the southern regions. No more than in Portsmouth, where the Germans have overseen endeavors to cleanse the city of its radioactivity.\n\nNow officially, the Kaiser has ordered them to remain until \"a settlement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the German Empire has been reached\". Clearly a ploy to ensure our brothers in Ottawa don't interfere in the matters of Britain. As long as the Germans remain here in sovereign British territory, we are at a deadlock as to how we deal with them. For now, they will stay, we do not currently have the resources to dislodge them from their garrisons, and they may prove at least somewhat useful in pacifying the southern militants. However, if the Germans are permitted to remain here for too long, it may just spiral out of control..."

krg_eng.3.t: "Aftermath of Heimdallr"
krg_eng.3.d: "\"This area is now a quarantine zone! All citizens of Portsmouth are to comply with local authorities! Any and all trespassers and non-compliant citizens will be prosecuted and detained accordingly!\"\n\nThis is the reality of the citizens of Portsmouth, or at least the ones still nearby the city. In the trauma centres surrounding the exclusion zone there are thousands clinging to life as their body begins to shut down, with burns at every single part of their body thanks to the Atomic fire. The city centre is nothing but a desolate wasteland, a thriving city turned into a ghost town. Buildings have crumbled, and radioactive dust has settled across Hampshire. The crackling sounds of geiger counters and dosimeters are the norm across the razed Portsea Island.\n\nAll readings and studies from the blast are hazy to say the least. Scientists have estimated the blast to be approximately equivalent to 25 Kilotons of TNT, and preliminary estimates are reading the death toll to be at least 40,000, with countless thousands more being permanently affected by Heimdallr. It will take years for the city to be rebuilt, and that's if the radiation dissapates as quickly as the experts are predicting it will. No matter what happens to the city, it is clear that the Kaiser's recklessness has created a new precedent and a new world. One wherein humanity, after centuries of unending conflict, finally had the weapon it needed to enter its inevitable phase...\n\nExtinction."

krg_eng.4.t: "The King's Speech"
krg_eng.4.d: "Earlier today, King Edward VIII made an impactful speech to a small crowd of Royalists and Accord military forces in front of Windsor Castle. Speaking on radio to people across the nation & the world, the King spoke for over 20 minutes addressing the war, and the recovery to come.\n\n'...Let us remember those who will not come back, their sacrifice and endurance in the face of merciless oppression. Let us remember the men and women in all the Services who have laid down their lives liberating our country from the heel of the red-menace. We have come to the end of our tribulation, and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing. But they will never be forgotten.\n\nThen let us salute in proud gratitude the great host of the living who have brought us to victory. I cannot praise them to the measure of each one's service, for in a total war the efforts of all rise to the same noble height and all are devoted to the common purpose. Armed or unarmed, men and women, you have fought and striven to your utmost. No one knows that better than I do. As your King I thank with a full heart those who bore arms so valiantly on land, sea or air; for without you the syndicalists could never have been defeated...'"

krg_eng.5.t: "Organise the National Government"
krg_eng.5.d: "Earlier today, his majesty Edward VIII approached Anthony Eden with perhaps one of the most important requests in the history of Albion. After the tyrannical dictatorship of Mosley and the uncertainty that followed, there was finally going to be an end and a return to civilian leadership. Eden was tasked with restoring the government and returning to long-suspended parliamentary rule in Britain.\n\nIt would be a long process, of course. Negotiations would have to be had to reform labor, military leaders would step down or run for election, and national elections would have to be funded from somewhere. If successfully completed, Eden would almost certainly become the first of the reformed government, and fall among history's greatest."
krg_eng.5.a: "But with our king, anything becomes possible. Even this."

krg_eng.6.t: "Finalising the Cabinet"
krg_eng.6.d: "King Edward VIII, celebrated as 'the liberator' by loyalists both at home in Britain and Canada, is about to finally execute his imperial prerogatives after returning to Britain. Anthony Eden, acting Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is to meet him today to discuss the formation of a new temporary Government body.\n\nEden, however, has a lot on his plate. Military and civil service authorities made abundantly clear that a general election would be impossible for at least 2 years; thus, a Government would have to be formed exclusively on the basis of negotiation among parties. And if the historical factionalism between the Liberals and Conservatives was not enough of a headache, a number of \"special commissioners\" and personal friends of the King are expecting roles in the forming government.\n\nFor any negotiated coalition to work, some sort of clear political concensus on reconstruction will have to form, something that will take time to naturally establish itself. But today a provisional cabinet needs to be drawn up so that Eden can offer the King a working Government.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the King go behind closed doors, and the proposal is..."
krg_eng.6.a: "A prominently Conservative Government, with few Liberal ministers."
krg_eng.6.b: "A balanced Government, with key ministries split between Conservatives and Liberals."

The new cabinet is composed of predominantly conservative politicians, with other factions taking up undersecretaries in a negotiated proportion (as no electoral procedure could be organized) and is officially not considered a \"regular\" cabinet due to its non-representative nature and the extra, functionally worthless, positions allotted to the leading officers of the previous, short lived occupation.\n\nYet no matter how many placations and assurances as to its competence and temporary nature are given, everyone in Britain seems to be persuaded to have a right to sit in it, while southern England currently lies almost entirely beyond Eden's reach."

krg_eng.8.t: "Arming Loyalist Militias"
krg_eng.8.d: "As the workday in Windsor Castle ends and the reports begin flowing to the Crown's officers, it appears that the most terrible legacy of the Maximist regime might not be the years of war, starvation and death, but rather the immense arsenal amassed by the regime's paramilitaries in the last months before its demise. It appears that most of these arsenals have been emptied without leaving trails by the very same \"redshirt\" militias that were supposed to defend Mosley's republic to the last bullet. As the regular troops cannot protect the whole country from heavily armed terrorists, an ordinance calling for the creation of territorial militias, officially named "Local Defence Volunteer Groups", has been approved. Now, they are in the process of being armed with what little weaponry we have access to, even if some of it is grossly inadequate for the purpose."

While well-received in some areas and seen by some of the fallen regime's most shell-shocked survivors as a welcome alternative to government-controlled security. However, members of the cabinet are worried they could easily represent a problem if their diverse leadership ever had an internal divergence - or, God forbid, if they ever decided that we are not acting in Britain's best interest..."

krg_eng.10.d: "After a twenty-three years hiatus, the Union Jack flies over London once more. The wealth of the Canadian economy is being funneled toward the reconstruction of Great Britain, and the Kaiser, while powerful, is for now content to sit in Berlin without posing a threat to us. Yet there is one very glaring elephant in the room - namely, the former Maximist leadership who are prisoner across the country. One of the first tasks of the National Government will be to organize a great trial of these monstrous criminals: a fair one, though the chances of any of them being completely acquitted are almost null.\n\nHaving been in planning since 1942, the Trials on the Crimes and Violations of International Law of the Maximist Criminal Organization were originally intended as a temporary international court tasked with passing judgement on all the leaders of the Internationale; however the French and Italian governments unilaterally decided to hold their own trials, leaving the Germans and the British to fight over the most wanted of Mosley's cohorts. As tensions between the Entente and the Reichspakt rapidly escalate, Prime Minister Eden has informed the press of an upcoming announcement regarding the much-awaited trial, immediately echoed by a communique from Berlin, demanding to be represented in the panel of justices. "
krg_eng.10.a: "Justice must be served"

krg_eng.11.t: "Invite the Germans?"
krg_eng.11.d: "Ever since the Entente joined the Weltkrieg, diplomats exchanged notes between Berlin and Ottawa to determine the fate of the Internationale after the war. One consistent point was the establishment of a special international tribunal to judge the criminal leaders of the British Maximist organization, recognized as the instigators of all the horror of the war. However, the French withdrawal from the scheduled Birmingham Trials has offered Prime Minister Eden a chance to shake things up one last time. The Government, however, is divided on the issue.\n\nAs much as we may not like it, Germany took the brunt of the Maximist offensive and was the victim of most of the Maximists' war crimes, and without the Germans' furious aerial onslaught the Liberation may not have been possible. This is the most powerful argument brought to the Prime Minister's table by those favorable to a mixed British-German jury for the trial of Maximist criminals. The most powerful argument not brought to the table is of course the consistent German meddling in our affairs.\n\nThen again, having foreigners participate in the judgement of a British subject establishes a dangerous precedent and could easily be interpreted as a submissive move, one that would undermine not only the Government but possibly the legitimacy of the Trials themselves. Yet with the date of the Trials' official announcement closing in Eden must make a call, will the Reich be represented in the trial of the century? Finally, Eden makes his choice.\n\n'Contact Berlin. Tell them...'"

krg_eng.12.t: "Who should be tried?"
krg_eng.12.d: "Whenever an entire organization is put on trial, one of the first thing that need to be sorted is the degree to which individual members are to be held accountable. This goes all the more for an organization with a membership in the tens of millions - such as the Internationale. \n\nEven though the French have relieved us of the hassle of putting on their Communards on the stand and the various Italian authorities have shared in amity their own war criminals to put on trial, the task of judging an organization as pervasive as the Maximists still makes this a fundamental point. Alongside the monsters who caused untold devastation, we have scores of other trade unionists & socialists who may also be complicit in their own share of war crimes. Shall the Birmingham Trials only trial the highest echelons of the national leadership, or shall we endeavor to expand the court for \"minor\" apparatchiks of the regime, costly and time-consuming as it may be?"

krg_eng.13.d: "Today the city of Birmingham has entered a state of alert unheard of since the Liberation. Tanks and armored vehicles rolled into town during the night, as troops disembarked from trains, trucks and half-tracks. A small fleet of armored cars drove through the city surrounded by armed soldiers, as the population looked on from behind their windows. Today, the Trials on the Crimes and International Law Violations of the Maximist Criminal Organization, or, more speedily, the Birmingham Trials, have officially begun. The men and women brought into the courtroom have been on every newsreel for the past twelve years. Cynthia Mosley. Francis Hawkins. John Strachey. The list goes on, as the names that have once shaken the world are listed by the sergeant-at-arms, resplendent in the decorated ceremony uniform of the Royal Marines.

krg_eng.14.d: "Colonel David Stirling was a young, capable officer, showing a tendency for daring, potentially reckless operations that would almost always succeed. It is obvious then that he became highly regarded as a man who could get things done. As many became disillusioned during the latter stages of the war, Stirling became involved in a plot to overthrow the Maximist regime and reach a peace settlement with the Reichspakt-Entente alliance, alongside Eric Blair, Tom Wintringham and many others. The plot failed miserably, and Stirling was imprisoned and tortured, almost like a human guinea pig. With deep mental issues, he has been found unfit to stand trial, and psychologist Dr Donald Ewan Cameron is interested in moving Stirling to Canada for research purposes."

krg_eng.15.t: "The Trial of James Maxton"
krg_eng.15.d: "James Maxton was one of the most prominent Scottish syndicalists and was instrumental in stoking the British Revolution north of the border. Influential throughout the 20s & early 30s thanks to his formidable oratory skills, Maxton was in strong opposition to the Maximist movement as it gained strength. Following Mosley's consolidation of power in 1937, Maxton was forced to go into hiding in his native Scotland, where he still organised resistance to Mosley's control. After being taken prisoner by Canadian forces during the liberation of the Isles, his health rapidly degraded whilst in captivity. He died shortly before trial from Liver Cancer, and as such can't be tried."
krg_eng.15.a: "He was one of the 'better' socialists."

krg_eng.16.t: "The Trial of Harry Pollitt"
krg_eng.16.d: "Harry Pollitt is a complex figure. The once-protege of Tom Mann, Harry Pollitt served as the Union of Britian's Foreign Secretary throughout much of the 1930s. A war hawk, Pollitt was a prime-mover in Britain's rearmament during the 30s, and the rise of Oswald Mosley as another man who recognised the need for Britain to strike against the so-called reactionaries. However, committed to Mannist Syndicalism, Pollitt was sidelined by the Maximist government after its ascension, eventually sacked from his post as Foreign Secretary in 1937 and shuffled out of the Executive Committee all together in the days before the war began, and the Maximists secured complete control over the administration.\n\nPollitt remained an important organiser of the war effort on the home front, creating much of the damaging war propaganda that led to the war crimes that littered the Republican Army's conduct in the closing years of the conflict. Apprehended with other holdouts in the Pennines, Pollit denied committing war crimes himself, citing his long-term rivarly with Mosley that left him politically powerless by 1940. Despite this, he has been found guilty of Crimes against Peace, and his sentence now awaits."

krg_eng.17.t: "The Trial of Arthur Horner"
krg_eng.17.d: "Arthur Horner was an early radical in the United Kingdom, and was responsible for fanning the flames of revolution through South Wales. A committed orthodox syndicalist, Horner rose through the Trade Union Congress until he one of the most popular politicians in Britain, popularity that's endured ever since. However, the rise of Maximism, and his vocal opposition of Chairman Mosley, cut off any chance of success. Following an attempted assassination in 1939, Horner went into hiding for the duration of the war, before turning himself into Canadian troops during the Invasion of Britain. Arthur Horner has been aquitted of potential war crimes, however some judges think a separate trial could see the highly influential, and possibly dangerous Trade Unionist behind bars."
krg_eng.17.a: "Be merciful and let him walk."
krg_eng.17.b: "As a unifying syndicalist, he can't be free. Retry him at a later date."

krg_eng.18.t: "The Trial of Philip Piratin"
krg_eng.18.d: "Philip Piratin was one of the countless revolutionaries that participated in the British Revolution, and this zeal remained as the Union strengthened. Initially a vocal supporter of the Maximist movement, Piratin turned away from Mosley following an anti-semitism row triggered by Alexander Raven Thomson. Following Mosley's concentration of power Piratin fled to France, where he spent much of the war producing a newspaper for the British soldiers fighting on the Rhine. He was then captured by German forces in Lille during the Communes downfall. Piratin has been found guilty of crimes against peace, though his opposition to Maximism has prosecutors split on the sentence he should receive."
krg_eng.18.a: "10 years in prison will do."

krg_eng.19.d: "Though initially a radical, Clement Attlee became one of the more moderate members of the Trade Union Congress. The leader of the 'Parliamentarians', a group wishing to bring back a proper democracy to Britain, Attlee found himself at great odds with the increasingly influential Maximists. Upon Mosley's concentration of power, Attlee like many of his comrades fled the country to escape persecution. Eventually, Attlee would flee all the way to Canada to seek clemency, though he would instead be interned for most of the war. After hearing his firm belief in peaceful reform and hearing his story, Attlee has been overwhelmingly acquitted on all charges, and most of the prosecution are questioning why he was even indicted. In the end it was decided to give Attlee his freedom....."

krg_eng.20.d: "General Lewis Pugh Evans was one of the most important generals from the Union of Britain, and a feared commander on the western front. With a military career spanning some 40 years, Evans was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Weltkrieg before betraying his kingdom during the British Revolution. During the Second Weltkrieg Evans commanded a significant portion of the Union's detachment in the Rhineland, and some divisions under his command caused several war crimes, including the Sack of Rotterdam. Evans claimed he was merely \"following orders\" from the Chief of Staff, and that he shouldn't be held responsible for his soldiers crimes. However, he has still been found guilty of war crimes, and now a punishment must be chosen."

krg_eng.21.d: "Alliott Verdon Roe, Aeronautical pioneer and founder of the Avro aircraft manufacturer. While many businessmen and industrialists fled the Revolution, Roe remained in Britain to expand his aircraft manufacturing. He became affiliated with Mosley in the early 30s, and used this influence to push Avro planes, especially bombers, to the fore. With the Manchester, the Lancaster and finally the Lincoln, Roes planes caused untold destruction across Europe. In addition, Roe reportedly employed slave labour, using political prisoners to construct aircraft without pay to increase efficiency. With evidence of Roe's support of Mosley coming out during the trial, and having been found guilty of crimes against peace, many prosecutors want him imprisoned for assisting the regime. However, with Roes old age & advancing senility, others feel house arrest would be adequate."
krg_eng.21.a: "He will live out his days under House Arrest."
krg_eng.21.b: "He supported Mosley, give him 10 years behind bars."

krg_eng.22.t: "The Trial of William Forbes-Sempill"
krg_eng.22.d: "An experienced air officer & engineer, and a follower of Oswald Mosley from before the Revolution, William Forbes-Sempill served as Commander in Chief for the Republican Air Force for most of the Second Weltkrieg. In this role, he modelled the Air Force off of a doctrine of strategic destruction, and through this is responsible for the levelling of countless German cities, like Hamburg, Cologne & Frankfurt. Though he's been found guilty of several war crimes, his sentence has been greatly reduced owing to the fact that the Canadian, French & German air forces also committed the same crimes. The German officers present have especially been pushing for him to get off lightly, since in the face of Heimdallr anything else would seem utterly hypocritical."
krg_eng.22.a: "He caused untold destruction, but so did everyone else. 10 Years."

krg_eng.23.t: "The Trial of Bill Alexander"
krg_eng.23.d: "Bill Alexander, infamous partisan, veteran of the Spanish & American Civil wars and an undeniable war criminal. Alexander led volunteer brigades in Spain & America in the lead up to the Second Weltkrieg, becoming a feared commander on the battlefield. During the Second Weltkrieg, he was essentially in charge of the Maximist army, and reportedly signed off on many plans that would result in rampant atrocities, such as the Invasions of Ireland & Holland. In addition, it was Alexander's influence that placed political commissars on the field, which caused even more unnecessary harm. On the stand, Alexander remained loudly committed to his ideology, but claimed ignorance to atrocities he was responsible for. Bill Alexander has been found guilty on all counts, however some feel his widespread military knowledge is worth sparing his life."
krg_eng.23.a: "Alexander could prove useful. Life imprisonment."
krg_eng.23.b: "Nothing will stop justice. Put Alexander to death."

krg_eng.24.t: "The Trial of Alexander Raven Thomson"
krg_eng.24.d: "Alexander Raven Thomson, usually known as simply 'Raven', is considered the 'Creator of Maximism'. Mosley's chief ideologue, Raven was one of the earliest followers of the 'Grand Protector', and also one of his most loyal. On the stand, Raven claimed he was unaware of the atrocities that the Union of Britain performed during the Second Weltkrieg, saying he was merely a philosopher rather than a political and military figure. In the end though, he was found guilty on all counts. Much of the tribunal recommends an execution, though the Maximist Front is threatening a reaction in the event of Ravens death."
krg_eng.24.a: "We cant risk more instability, Life imprisonment."
krg_eng.24.b: "We wont bow to terrorists. Hang him!"

krg_eng.25.t: "The Trial of John Strachey"
krg_eng.25.d: "John Strachey was one of Mosley's first followers, from even before the formation of the Maximist movement. A charismatic figure who had a keen mind for economic matters, Strachey served as Secretary of State for War throughout most of the Second Weltkrieg, being responsible for keeping Britain's war machine running. At the end of the war, Strachey was also the final Chairman of the Union of Britain, following a series of betrayals in those final days. Strachey argued that he distanced himself from the ideological fanaticism displayed by several of his peers, a claim proven by various private documents from Mosley's inner circle. Nevertheless, he has been found guilty on several counts, and all that is needed now is his punishment."
krg_eng.25.a: "He didnt share the madness of Maximism, give him life."
krg_eng.25.b: "He caused the deaths of millions, he deserves death too."

krg_eng.26.t: "The Trial of William Joyce"
krg_eng.26.d: "A radical unionist who moved to the Union of Britain following Irish unification, William Joyce became an ally of Mosley in the early 30s. The Anglo-Irishman quickly became revered as a fierce orator and master at creating effective propaganda for the Maximist regime. When Ireland was subsequently invaded during the Second Weltkrieg, Joyce was put in place as the man in charge of Irish occupation, working as the puppet master behind the Soar Eire regime. He is therefore directly responsible for the persecution of tens of thousands of Irish nationalists. Joyce has been found guilty on all counts, and he's shown himself to be utterly unrepentant. However, complicating matters somewhat, the Irish are requesting an extradition to enable them to try him themselves for other crimes."
krg_eng.26.a: "Extradite Joyce to Ireland, and let them deal with him."
krg_eng.26.b: "This man must be executed, the Irish can try him in absentia."

krg_eng.27.t: "The Trial of Cynthia Mosley"
krg_eng.27.d: "Lady Cynthia Mosley was the 'Grand Protector's' wife for 27 years, and throughout all that time never left her husband's side. A powerful politician in her own right, Cynthia was instrumental in building public support for Maximism and, during her time as Foreign Secretary, steering the Union of Britain towards war with the Reichspakt. Following the detonation of Heimdallr, Cynthia attempted to flee to neutral Norway, being captured by German troops and thus not meeting the fate of her husband. Suffering from acute appendicitis, Mosley was unable to take the stand, though privately she always espoused her ignorance to any war crimes. With her trial over, Cynthia has been found guilty on all counts, and the only thing stopping an unanimous execution verdict is her vast public support, especially amongst the women of Britain."
krg_eng.27.a: "Sentence Cynthia to life imprisonment."
krg_eng.27.b: "Damn the women who idolise her, send Mosley to her death!"

krg_eng.28.t: "The Trial of Eric Blair"
krg_eng.28.d: "Eric Blair, to many better known by his pen name 'George Orwell', was an famous pro democratic syndicalist within the the international, and a globally renowned author outside of it. Residing in France for most of the war, he would flee to Britain by late 45. While a vehement anti authoritarian he still supported syndicalism until the end of the war."

krg_eng.29.t: "The Trial of Neil Francis Hawkins"
krg_eng.29.d: "Neil Francis Hawkins, Mosley's 'Father of Maximist Terror'. A firm ideologue, a committed ally to Mosley, and the perpetrator to many atrocities, on both the home front and the frontlines. Hawkins' personal crackdowns on political opposition and civilian discontent have given him a horrifying reputation. On the stand he tried to claim ignorance to any crimes against humanity, in spite of overwhelming evidence putting him at the very centre of the Maximist Regime. It didn't take long for him to be convicted on all counts. With crowds of monarchists & socialists alike calling for his head, and with evidence of further atrocities committed during his reign of terror turning up by the day, an execution is clearly the only option."
krg_eng.29.a: "Hang the monster!"

krg_eng.30.t: "Sentencing the Criminals"
krg_eng.30.d: "The last day of the Trials, perhaps the most awaited one on both sides of the bar, has finally come. After the last round of talks, consultations and review, the final sentences have been read out to the accused. Reactions varied, with newspapers reporting of Hawkins' undignified protestations and the grim acceptance of most others. As the courtroom was being vacated the press descended on the judges and prisoners alike. Tomorrow morning every newspaper in the world will have these photos and what few interviews have actually been released on the front page. But today, Britain and the world begin expressing their judgement on the judges themselves. Prominent Nationalist speakers have protested the fact that some of the defendants were not sentenced to death. The underground Maximist circles, according to the authorities, are entirely unfazed and mostly consider the sentences \"the historically pre-determined consequence of counterrevolution\".\n\n The international reactions are more positive, with most ambassadors reassuring the National Government that the Trials' outcome will be well-received abroad.\n\n What really matters, of course, is the reaction of the British population; not the extremist fringes but the majority of centrist, former syndicalist and depoliticized subjects on which the National Government counts for support. Fortunately, the reaction seems to be mostly positive, with limited opposition mostly registered in remaining \"legitimate\" leftist circles. With the sentences having been handed out, all there is left to do is to make them effective and present the final statements to the public."
krg_eng.30.a: "Their punishments are fair and just."

krg_eng.31.t: "The Day of Executions"
krg_eng.31.d: "\"The sentence of this court is that you will be taken from here to the place from whence you came, and there be kept in close confinement until [GetDateText], and upon that day that you be taken to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy upon your soul.\"\n\nThese words have rang out in the back of the condemned's heads since the sentencing. Not too long ago, these people were enjoying their power within the court of Chairman Mosley, helping steer Britain towards a new age beneath his gaze. And then, the war came, and the King returned. And thus, the condemned of the Birmingham trials have been waiting for the day of dread. Perhaps reflecting upon their own mortality, or raging against the forces of reaction, or despairing. Only God may tell.\n\nFinally, the day arrived. Across the nation, at 8 AM, Pierrepoint, his fellow executioners and their aides entered the condemned's cells. Then came the bound hands, the walk to the gallows, the white hood, and then, the noose. Finally, the trapdoors opened, and the condemned of Birmingham were sent towards the hereafter, to be judged once more."
krg_eng.31.a: "They got what they deserved."

krg_eng.32.t: "The End of the Birmingham Trials"
krg_eng.32.d: "Today the fortified courthouse of the Birmingham Trials shows a very different face. Gone are most of the armed guards, and the halls are lined with flags and the uniformed picket of the Coldstream Guards.\n\nKing Edward himself has in fact decided to attend the closing session of the Trials. The solemn reading of a relation from the Justices and one from the jury is followed by a glowing royal speech, in which Edward launched himself in the panegyric of the British judicial system in front of a massive crowd of reporters and foreign dignitaries. Later in the evening the National Government released a more sedate press statement praising the correctness of the trial in spite of the \"known and demonstrable crimes of the accused parties\".\n\nBut while the mainstream press has been more than ready to paint the end of the Trials in a triumphal light, reactions across the country have been more mixed. Nationalists have not refrained from restating their opinion that the only crime committed was Maximism; and that Maximism in all its forms was a capital crime. A sudden spike in violent episodes all across the nation has been interpreted by police and military authorities as the protest of the Mosleyite lost-causers. They are confident, however, that stability will return soon.\n\nAppreciative, in any event, was the German reaction. The Kaiser's ambassador plenipotentiary to London, while stressing Germany's right to have representatives among the judges, has thanked profusely his British counterparts for the \"expediency\" and \"courtesy\" demonstrated in our handling of so delicate a matter. \"The Kaiser\" he concluded \"will certainly be pleased\"."

krg_eng.33.t: "Protests for Arthur Horners Release"
krg_eng.33.d: "The end of the Birmingham trials, several prominent members of the former TUC have either been arrested or executed, for better or worse. Arthur Horner, a member of the Federalist faction in the Union of Britain, was sent to prison until his own trial has concluded and thus has caused an outcry from the sizeable population of Moderate Syndicalists and Federalist supporters in the country.\n\nThe near daily protests in London and Birmingham, along with strikes, has forced the Government to take action. Some members of Parliament are arguing that he should be released to appease the war torn masses, coupled with the fact that Arthur Horner claimed to be adamantly against Mosley's regime. Despite this, others believe that releasing him would cause even more problems, as they believe that his release would bolster support for syndicalism and that he could potentially work against the government. With Parliament divided on the issue, a conclusion must be made."

krg_eng.35.t: "Fight during the Trials!"
krg_eng.35.d: "Today's session of the Birmingham Trials had to be suspended, for the first time since the Trials' beginning. A furious row of insults and threats erupted between two accused who have had long standing issues between each other. John Strachey, Mosley's miracle worker and chief coordinator of the Union of Britain's war economy, was introduced in the courtroom at the same time as Neil Francis Hawkins, Mosley's 'Father of Maximist Terror'. In what could easily be described as an overly dramatic course of events, Strachey was visibly angry when he saw Hawkins, before hollering an unrepeatable string of insults, interspersed with accusations, at him.\n\nAccused of everything from embezzlement to treason to the murder of inner Party members, Hawkins was only momentarily taken aback before firing his own insults against the ex-Secretary for War. Attempts by the two sergeants-at-arms to separate the pair have been in vain, the shouting only rising as the press in the room scribbled furiously and the judge vainly brought down his gavel, calling for order.\n\n From what could be understood of the shouting match, Strachey's ire was roused by the fact that Hawkins, who claimed to be the fiercest paladin of Maximism and of the British proletariat, decided in the last months of war to hide rather than fight or, as Strachey himself did, stay in the capital and, in the end negotiate the Union's surrender as its de jure chairman.

krg_eng.39.t: "Women Workers go on strike"
krg_eng.39.d: "Women factory workers in Britain became a reality during the First Weltkrieg, and ever since then this increasingly competent and appreciated workforce has become a fixture of the British economy. As it had been charitably assumed that the good women of Britain had only followed the Mosleyite regime due to a lack of alternatives, no actions had been taken against their workplace representatives.\n\nIn the wake of Cynthia Mosley's condemnation, this has been proven to have been a mistake. The final sentence against the widow of the Grand Protector and formerly the most powerful woman in the entire world has apparently caused the first organized nationwide strike since the beginning of the Maximist regime - a women's general strike. Retrospectively, a loud reaction was predictable: Mrs. Mosley was the main inspirer of her husband's foreign policy, of the practice of arming insurgencies and terrorist groups across the world and even an undocumented but widely reported attempt to reach an agreement with Savinkov's Russia to partition Europe; she had built an image as the icon of an independent, politically active female gender.\n\nIn response to her trial, British women have struck a temporary but crippling blow to entire industrial centers, perhaps in an effort to force the Court to reconsider, perhaps in the more realistic perspective of forcing the issue of women's political participation in the new regime. Whatever the reason, this reaction is only a further motivation to carry out the sentence, as such a powerful Maximist influence cannot be allowed to linger. "

krg_eng.40.t: "Celebrations for the Tribunals End"
krg_eng.40.d: "The first hours of the day after the official end of the Birmingham Trials began with the radio-chronicled arrival of a caravan of large Imperial Motors limousines at Windsor Castle. Riding up the Long Walk, Prime Minister Eden's vehicle was the first to arrive, as a delegation of uniformed valets stood at attention to greet the guests. After nearly an hour of greetings and introductions, the cream of the crop of British politics were gathered in the Upper Ward where the King himself joined them for an official celebration. Food and drink were made available and pleasant conversation carried on late until in the evening as the guests enjoyed the amenities of the Windsor castle grounds.\n\nWith the rest of the country gearing up for similar celebrations, His Majesty took to a podium around 17:00 to deliver a speech in front of his guests and the nation as a whole. So great was the emotion and so solemn the occasion that no one objected when His Majesty called for the Head Justice of Birmingham to come to the podium, and deliver a final word himself on the British judiciary's finest hour.\n\nAt 22:30 the Prime Minister's motorcade was back in a festive London, windows, squares and streets lighted up with small, spontaneous celebrations and family gatherings still going on hours after the King's speech. For the first time in what now feels like years, Britain looks content and even happy about its future.\n\nAnd once finally arrived to his residence in Downing Street, almost a final parting gift from a most satisfying day, PM Eden received a late phone call from no one else than the Canadian ambassador, offering their explicit congratulations on the end of the Birmingham Trials"

krg_eng.400.a: "We almost had them"

krg_eng.41.t: "The House of Lords is Operational"
krg_eng.41.d: "Historically, the upper house of Parliament has been the House of Lords, an appointed house filled with political veterans, aristocrats and bishops. The role of the Lords is to simply to scruntinise and amend bills approved by the House of Commons, in accordance with the Parliament Act of 1911. That act ensures the Lords is an ultimately powerless institution, that cant completely block any legislation. Upon the British Revolution, the House of Lords was moved to Canada, replacing their Senate. Without the Lords' expert eyes, our reformed government cannot adequately function.\n\nWith the reclamation of the Home Islands, Canada had an opportunity to restore the Senate. With Edward's blessing, the House of Lords was legally moved back to Britain, however it's taken the National Government until now to actually have it up and running. With the vast majority of the Lords slowly moving back to the Home Islands, the upper house of our legislature can officially be considered open.\n\nThe restoration of the House of Lords has been met with some controversy. Amongst the large syndicalist populace still existing within our country, the Lords is yet another symbol of regressive, reactionary oppression. An uptick in protest in our industrial heartlands has already been registered, though many former syndicalists who defected to the National Government have defended the restoration. As expected, Ernest Thurtle and his Republicans have made the biggest fuss, calling for a truely republican and democratic system to be formed. However, this unrest is only expected to be temporary, and soon we'll have a fully-functioning government on our hands."
krg_eng.41.a: "Our Government is coming together"

krg_eng.42.t: "Filling the House of Commons"
krg_eng.42.d: "With the House of Lords restored, the only stumbling block for our legislature to be fully operational is the currently empty and recently reconstructed House of Commons. As stipuated across a host of different acts, the House of Commons is supposed to be a democratically elected house, with MPs voted in during a General Election. Obviously, Britain isn't in a position to host a General Election in the immediate future, so something needs to be done to solve this dilemma.\n\nA new act, the Emergency Parliament Act [GetYear] has been introduced to the Lords by the National Government for approval. Within it, it gives the Sovereign the ability to appoint members to the Commons if the country is in a national emergency. This bill is expected to be pushed through the Lords in the coming days, which will allow for the Commons to be filled without an Election. The bill is also expected to be shortlived, with Prime Minister Eden privately claiming that "the bill be repealed within a month."\n\nSuch an act could theoretically lead to the entire house being packed with avowed royal loyalists, turning Britain into a de-facto dictatorship. King Edward has quickly opposed such actions, and together with various political figures has put together a plan to, at least somewhat fairly, fill the Commons. With no legal political parties existing as of yet, half of the house will be filled with conservative-aligned politicans on the reccomendation of Prime Minister Eden. The other half will be split, between influential independents, former Liberals and, in a suprising move, a group of former-syndicalist collaborators lead by Herbert Morrison. This move has obviously been considered outrageous by many, but King Edward himself has justified the decision, saying "We need to rebuild trust in the people of the country, and having some of their own participating in government goes a long way to rebuilding that trust."\n\nThe whole process is expected to take a couple of weeks, by which time Parliament will finally be in a position to be reopened."
krg_eng.42.a: "Lets get it done"

krg_eng.4200.t: "Parliament is in Session!"
krg_eng.4200.d: "After months of preperations, the House of Commons has finally been filled with exactly 600 MPs, and today the King officially summoned Parliament to begin sitting. During the ceremony, King Edward gave his first Speech from the Throne within Westminster Palace. Reading a speech prepared by Eden's cabinet, the King stressed that this parliamentary sessions goal is to Begin the political reconstruction of the United Kingdom, through the restoration of its liberal, democratic institutions whilst modernising actions are taken to bring old bills up to date". With the speech finished, and the ceremony over, Parliament is now officially in session.\n\nInside Parliament, the situation is rather divided as expected. With no formal political parties, therefore and no formal opposition, MPs arranged themselves on personal preference. For the most part this went smoothly, with de-facto Conservatives on the benches with the National Government. Before Parliament was adjoured for the day, the Prime Minister made a short speech thanking everyone for their cooperation, and celebrating the return of moderate rule to Britain.\n\nOutside Parliament, the expected violent protests from the syndicalist masses were much milder than the police had prepared for. It appears that Edward's gambit of including former syndicalist collaborators in the Commons has paid off, with many syndicalists satisfied that "their people" have been included in Government. Whether this moderating effect will take root is to be seen, but today a new day dawns on London."

krg_eng.43.t: "The New Boundry Commissions"
krg_eng.43.d: "Since the British Revolution, internal migration and increased urbanisation has caused the regional demographics of the United Kingdom to change drastically. This, in addition to the loss of Ulster, has resulted in the constituencies used in the 1926 General Election being woefully inadequate for any upcoming election.\n\nToday, Prime Minister Eden has passed the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act [GetYear], by a large margin of 504-111. The resistance to the bill, from MPs in fear of supposed gerrymandering, was weaker than expected. The act has served to establish permanent Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland and Wales, to facilitate the total constituency reform necessary for the next General Election.\n\nThe end goal of the Act is to redraw the constituencies of the UK. By utilising data from a currently in-progress national census, the 3 new boundary commissions aim to draw up a map of, ideally, 600 Constituencies of roughly equal population. These will need to take into account regional barriers and historical county divisions, while being completely free of political bias. The end result wont be completed for some time, at which point it's expected the new Constituencies will be put forward to Parliament for scrutiny and approval."

krg_eng.44.t: "The Representation of the People Act [GetYear]"
krg_eng.44.d: "With the British parliamentary system once again functioning, the first question at the order of the day is to determine the electorate for future Elections. Vital to this end is the reform of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which aimed to appease the suffragette movement by conceding the vote to British women, but under heavy restrictions.\n\nThe Revolutionary Government did not share the old Parliament's view on women's vote and under the Red regime women enjoyed equal representation (insofar as \"representation\" mattered under the Mosleyites); even the most devout desyndicalization officers admit that it is hard to imagine that what now amounts to more than half of the British adult population would surrender this right under the \"new old regime\". Working on a policy issue widely regarded as one of the factors that sparked the British Revolution of 1925 is exactly the last thing Eden or the reconstruction commissioners want, but the question can no longer be delayed.\n\nTrying to deal with the issue quickly, Eden and his cabinet have managed to table the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act [GetYear], as a means to restore the vote equality women enjoyed during the Union within the Westminster system by removing the property requirements and equalizing the voting age for men and women. The vote also has a clause abolishing the archaic practise of Plural Voting. There were hopes that the Act would have universal appeal to all members of the Commons. However, this has not materialised.\n\nA strong group of nationalistic, almost hyper-conservative former exiles have built a stiff opposition to the bill, claiming that Eden's bill is \"seditious\" and leaning on \"crypto-syndicalism\". Having lost his traditional base of support, Eden has found an ally in the fluid dynamics of Parliament: The Left. Since the act covertly borrows much from a similar act passed in the Union of Britain in 1928, once  former syndicalists have come to the defence of the Prime Minister, claiming that \"he has finally seen sense\". These actions have only emboldened opposition in the conservative camps, putting the Act in a worrying position.\n\nEden has ensured to present the Act as a vital component of the Reconstruction, counting on the MPs' patriotism to save the day. Even so, as the votes are counted, the anxiety in Downing Street is palpable. After a long, too long while, the radio sputters, and an excited newsman announces that..."

krg_eng.45.t: "The Firearms & Paramilitaries Act"
krg_eng.45.d: "The initial stages of the Reconstruction were plagued by public order issues, only partially solved by the presence of the Canadian military and the rapid restoration of constabularies across the United Kingdom. In those desperate days, the Government was more than happy to rely on volunteer militias of brave patriots to counter the Red terrorist bands and the occasional riot.\n\nNowadays, these groups risk to become an institution of British political life, their membership and funding having swelled well past what the Government considers \"safe figures\". To prevent a new source of radicalization from emerging and to consolidate the newly restored public order an Act has been proposed to outlaw paramilitary organizations in Britain, and to severely restrict the availability of firearms and munitions to the public. Both issues are however highly controversial, as a number of politicians have already become involved in the field of \"militia politics\" - usually taking sides in favor of their local Paramilitaries, and several Britons feel that the ownership of firearms is the only guarantee of safety in these troubled times."

krg_eng.46.t: "Voting on the Firearms & Paramilitaries Act"
krg_eng.46.d: "The Firearms & Paramilitaries Act, or to give it its full title the 'Firearms & Local Defence Volunteer Groups (Revision) Act [GetYear]', has now been debated in Parliament for a full week. In this time the Commons has seen itself devolve into chaos. Where votes can typically be predicted along normal ideological lines, this Act has seen MPs break ranks across the benches.\n\nThis is no better demonstrated with the "Conservative" benches. Prime Minister Eden has been aggressively pushing for the bill, no doubt due to the recent attempt on his life. However many of his colleagues have come out in opposition, for a myriad of reasons. Some say the militias help to combat potential militant syndicalists, to whom the National Government doesn't even exist. To these ministers, the assassination is enough evidence that the anti-syndicalist militias are necessary, and even should be expanded in future. To others, they have vested private interests in keeping the LDVGs operational, be it for business opportunities or hidden, more nefarious ones.\n\nWhatever the case may be, the House of Commons is bitterly divided. To try and get the vote over the line, Eden has resorted to attempting underhanded dealings with Herbert Morrison, who's leftist faction typically opposes the National Government's bills on a matter of principle. Even with this provisional support, the Commons stands completely split going into tonights crucial vote. The vote is called by the Speaker, and one by one MPs decide.

Police lines are burning with reports of paramilitary violence, against each other, the state and even innocents caught in their crossfire.\n\nThis matter cannot stand anymore.

Some of the more rightwards-leaning ministers of the Cabinet disagree however, viewing the smaller Ultras as a fundamentally controllable group, a useful cudgel to be given more leeway in order to keep Maximist remnants in line in ways that the Government may not be able to.\n\nThe internal debates are reaching a fevered pitch, and ultimately the decision is made.."

krg_eng.49.d: "As Parliament remains in chaos over the failure of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act a whole other type of chaos is unleashed upon the streets of Britain. Military Police, Royal Constabulary, garrison soldiers are unleashed in a hunt for the Nationalist leaders associated with the violences of the last months. Dozens are dragged out of their beds, but dozens more have to be searched for in the countryside, in hidden shelters carved out of the bombed buildings, or in the homes of ostensibly respectable friends. It's a police action on a scale unseen since the Mosley era, and the nefarious parallel does not escape the critical press.\n\nSafe in the Prime Minister's residence at the number 10 of Downing Street, the National Government has declared the United Empire League a terrorist group, aiming to steer public opinion sharply against the royalist nationalists. And yet even as the names come rolling in through the telephone lines Eden and the officers gathered in Downing Street mourn a victory that looks and feels like a defeat. The police action was necessary and, by all standards, largely successful; the League is now a headless beast with most of its leadership jailed. But even leaders are replaceable, and without the stringent limits on paramilitary activity such organizations are not technically illegal; while splintered and abandoned by its main financers, the British far right is still armed and dangerous.\n\nAnd while once untouchable Nationalists are thrown in prison with Mosleyite criminals, the remaining speakers of the right rhetorically asks through the radio and the newspapers why the National Government would hunt down provenly anti-Syndicalist, loyal British subjects of unimpeachable monarchist faith, and a destabilising effect has been felt across the country.\n\n In Britain's, and indeed the world's uncertain political climate, a mutilated victory against extremism is no victory at all."

krg_eng.50.t: "The United Empire League gains momentum"
krg_eng.50.d: "This Saturday the people of the United Kingdom at large stood aghast, in uncomprehending silence, as the radios and TV sets sputtered to life to report the happenings of the last few days. After the failure of the Government to pass the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act the United Empire League, possibly the rightmost political force in Britain, has announced a colossal mobilization of its own militias. In a ceremony held near the historic site of the Battle of Hastings nearly 8.000 associates of the League swore an oath of loyalty to the King-Emperor, the Empire, and the \"everlasting imperial mission of the White Man\", in front of a stunned crowd of curious locals and reporters.\n\nAfter the so-called Hastings Rally UEL recruitment centers opened up overnight in hundreds of British towns and boroughs, and a joint BLUE-MI5 reporting committee has presented to the Parliament an estimate of the League's membership surge over last week - placing their active numbers anywhere between ten and twenty thousand, and growing. With the organization's status still on the razor's edge between political extremism and outright terrorism this colossal oath ceremony has been cleverly presented as an olive branch to the political establishment by the League. Eden and his advisors, however, clearly see it as a move to enter the mainstream political spectrum; a move which has unfortunately succeeded in full.\n\nJust when the waters had seemed to have calmed Rotha Lintorn-Orman, an infamous anti-socialist (though for personal reasons rather than poltical successes) and now a prominent leader of the United Empire League, gave a chilling speech. In it, she advocated for a wave of anti-leftist violence on a scale and intensity 'unseen since the Glorious Liberation', concluding her appeal to political murder and epuration with a pacatedly-worded reassurance that the UEL militias stand ready to defend the Crown from the Red terrorists, in spite of the Government's failure to legally suppress said terrorists with the Firearms and Militias Act.\n\nWhile the tones and wording of the speech left everyone in the audience in some sort of disarray, no one failed to pick up the fact that Ms. Lintorn-Orman has essentially implied that, should the Act have passed, the UEL would not have considered itself in any obligation to dissolve its paramilitaries. And while a great many people are worried about the League usurping the role and dignity of a uniformed police service, a disturbing combination of anti-Syndicalist zeal and charitable activities are slowly but surely endearing the proud, dynamic UEL to the wider British public, something we must avoid at all costs."

Following the peak of their anti-syndicalist agitations in Hastings, and a concerted government campaign to stall the group, the United Empire League have begun calming their political activism under BLUE and MI5 scrutiny, however its unknown how much political influence they've gathered during the chaos. With reconstruction continuing unabated, police actions are becoming ever easier, and the political violence that instigated the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act debacle has finally began to subside.\n\nFirearm-related deaths are down 86% according to the latest batch of statistics, and the last month has seen no notable fights between radical mobs. As the febrile tranquillity of the Reconstruction once again settles over Great Britain, the tense days of the Hastings Rally seems a century away.\n\nWhile most officers caution against any displays of confidence that may constitute a challenge, the King himself has congratulated Eden on his handling of the crisis. Across the United Kingdom, devastated communities can now begin to heal, and even the less stricken areas of the country celebrate what appears to be a new age of peace after a time of fear and insecurity."

krg_eng.52.t: "The Firearms & Paramilitaries Act takes effect"
krg_eng.52.d: "It was one of the hardest battles ever fought in Westminster without artillery, the commentators will say, but the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act has passed. As soon as the vote's results were known, the King's approval made Eden's proposal into binding law, and the loyal press has been quick to detail how this Act will speed up the Reconstruction and make Great Britain safe again.\n\nThe far-right is of course spitting fire, with some going as far as to declare resistance against the Act - but it matters little. The National Government has, in theory, massively reduced the power of militias on both sides. Eden and the King have met privately to celebrate with other close confidants and courtiers, but all of Britain looks remarkably sunnier and calmer now that the threat of political violence has been stamped out by the Parliament.\n\nOf course, there is the matter of putting the dictate of Westminster in practice, something that Eden has also covered. His programme revolves around the formation of Disarmament Centers, run by local constabularies and supported by the Army, in every quarter of every major city, and smaller, more informal facilities being set up in every township with a population of over 10,000. Additionally, motorized patrols will in the coming months tour smaller centers to perform searches and confiscate weapons. Subjects wishing to keep whatever firearms they may possess will have a term of one month to apply for a license, which is not applicable to all types of firearms, allowing us to keep track of legally-owned firearms. Critics are already deriding the lofty goals of the programmes implementation, even if we do have the manpower required to carry out the undertaking."

krg_eng.53.t: "Police Station Shooting!"
krg_eng.53.d: "Today, Great Britain has been shaken by the Red terror once more. In application of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act a number of police stations and Army bases all over the United Kingdom have set up \"disarmament centres\", where under tight watch Britons are legally obliged to cede all owned firearms to the State. Everything was going fine on this morning in the Manchester Disarmament Center n°34, set up in the Whitefield Police Center, until a man (later identified as Edmund F. Burke, longtime suspect of Red sympathies) entered with the apparent intent of handing over an antiquated Webley revolver; when the guards tried to perform a security check on him, the man reportedly elbowed one in the stomach and took out the other with a burst from a Lancaster submachine gun he was hiding under his overcoat. Burke then opened fire in the police station, hitting civilians and officers alike. In all, 5 people were murdered and 39 were wounded by the crazed fanatic, who was brought down after no more than three minutes by the station's policemen. Further investigation conducted in the evening revealed that the shooting had been under preparation since the very day the proposal of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act was made public."
krg_eng.53.a: "Another tradegy"

krg_eng.54.t: "Shooting Narrowly Avoided"
krg_eng.54.d: "This evening, Prime Minister Eden made an extraordinary speech on nationwide radio. The occasion is a less than happy one, but the tones were nonetheless relieved. In application of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act a number of police stations and Army bases all over the United Kingdom have set up \"disarmament centres\", where under tight watch Britons are legally obliged to cede all owned firearms to the State, unless they are willing to obtain a license and submit themselves to periodic inspections. Everything was going fine on this morning in the Manchester Disarmament Center n°34, set up in the Whitefield Police Center, until a man (having identified himself as Edmund F. Burke, longtime suspect of Red sympathies) entered with the apparent intent of handing over an antiquated Webley revolver; when the guards tried to perform a security check on him, the man reportedly elbowed one in the stomach and aimed the revolver at the head of a civilian ahead of him in line, but just before he could fire he was struck out cold by the other guard with a nightstick blow to the head. This prompt reaction prevented a bloodbath: under his overcoat Burke carried a standard-issue Republican Army submachine gun and even a grenade, which he probably planned to use against the stunned crowd in the police station. In his speech the Prime Minister announced the heroic officer has been recommended for the new Edward Cross, created to celebrate heroism and courage amongst the civilian population."
krg_eng.54.a: "The Constabulary protects!"

krg_eng.55.t: "Disarmament Campaign proving successful"
krg_eng.55.d: "For many, the passing of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act was the easy part of ridding Britain from militia violence. Dealings in Parliament and thunderous speeches can only go so far, and it was generally considered the act meant nothing if it couldn't be enforced. Political skeptics went as far as saying that Eden's disarmament plans were futile, and would only be a further focal point of violence.\n\nIn actuality, the campaign to disarm militias and private citizens in Britain in accordance with the Act is proceeding much faster than expected. The authorities responsible for running the Disarmament centres have proven to be surprisingly efficient and competent, and the British populace has thankfully been very receptive to the programme. Already, several hundreds of thousands of license requests are being processed or archived and the corresponding weapons have been voluntarily registered, proving that the British people have not lost their faith in the government just yet.\n\nAs a bonus, we have acquired a large host of modern weaponry of all types, ranging from pistols to machine guns to even wholesale mortar systems, and some prudent quartermasters within the Army have even suggested recycling them back into use in military armouries, where required. With our industry still in tatters, any additional equipment is a blessing, and the syndicalist stamping can be easily sanded down where needed."

krg_eng.56.t: "The Industrial Relations Act [GetYear]"
krg_eng.56.d: "The Industrial Relations Act [GetYear], commonly refered to as the Trade Union Reform Act, was introduced by MP Harry Hylton-Foster this morning to a raucous crowd. The bill, which he introduced "as a radical reformatory moment in the history of Trade Unions, and a great triumph in the rights of the many employed in our nation." Of course, most don't see it exactly this way. In everything but name, the bill is the final erosion of any remaining trade union rights in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile initial ideas for the bill advocated for actually repealing some of the tight regulations on trade unions, hardliners and fervent anti-Syndicalists insisted on a comprehensive anti-union act. In short, the law would only allow workers any legal protection under specific registered trade unions, and a new National Industrial Relations Court would be empowered to grant injuctions to prevent strikes and settle disputes. In practice, this would give the government power to stop any strike it deems unnecessary as well as severly limit the power unregistered unions have."
krg_eng.56.a: "Hold a vote next week"

krg_eng.57.t: "Protests over the Industrial Relations Act"
krg_eng.57.d: "Not even the trade union leaders expected such a large response to the Industrial Relations Act. The bill, which quickly gained the moniker the "Anti-Union Act" and has even begun to be called so by conservative populations, is evidently proving to be incredibly unpopular among government-friendly trade unions. Within Parliament Herbert Morrison and his gang of 'reformed syndicalists' are up in arms at the proposed Act, and union leaders across the nation are attempting to plan a general strike. Large marches through every major city already in the works. Around half a million have already registered to march, the largest being in London itself. While the National Government expected a negative response, they could not imagine anything close to the scale of these demonstrations.\n\nWhile most tolerated the government's shift to the right, the cultural influence of trade unions still remains startlingly high after decades of syndicalist rule of the economy. It is clear, if this bill is to be passed, we cannot just wage a political war. We must wage a cultural war.""

krg_eng.58.t: "Voting on the Industrial Relations Act"
krg_eng.58.d: "Parliament felt different today. In the morning, when MPs streamed in to debate, squabble, and participate in the occasional vote, there was a certain camraderie that was found in every member's exhaustion. Politicians, even in their wide spectrum of views, all still shared the same occupation, filled with the same troubles and joys. It was perhaps the only thing that kept them away from each other's throats. \n\nToday, that camraderie was gone. A tense air stood in parliament, and members of opposing factions eyed each other shiftily, packing into the hall. The speaker eventually entered, and what was once tense murmurs became pure silence, punctuated only by the bellowing, hoarse voice of the speaker. The trade union bill that had sparked some of the largest protests in recent times and would completely uproot the nature of much of the UK's economy was to be voted on in a matter of minutes. \n\nFinally, the vote was conducted, and the tension was broken. A stream of yelling and even a small brawl between two members started before being cut off by the speaker's mallet."

To make things worse, they are being joined by many workers who didn't even have Red sympathies before this, but who loathe the thought of increased restrictions on organising.\n\nWith disturbances on the rise across the country, the pressure is rising to do something to quell the blaze before it expands into a wildfire."
krg_eng.59.a: "Try to prevent any backlash"

krg_eng.60.t: "Protests dissipate"
krg_eng.60.d: "Not that long ago, it seemed that the stage was being set for a Second British Revolution. And now, the dust is settling over quiet town squares across Britain.\n\nA combination of strategic wage raises and concessions have placated the least revolutionary protest participants; this has been compounded by the establishment of the Royal Bureau of Labour Relations through a rapidly-written Act of Parliament, giving the various loyal unions a way to properly mediate labour conflicts and disputes with the Government, under its auspices of course. Finally, the radical holdouts either dispersed or were arrested after they were found distributing prohibited pro-Maximist materiel.\n\nThe blaze that seemed ready to expand into a wildfire has been reduced to barely-burning embers; tensions may remain, but Britain may sleep peacefully. For now."
krg_eng.60.a: "And London is peaceful once more"

krg_eng.61.t: "'Progressive' MPs bring forward new bills"
krg_eng.61.d: "The name 'Ernest Thurtle' is one instantly associated with fierce migraines and seething frustration in the corridors of Westminster and the rooms of 10 Downing Street. He is only a few overblown lies short of a legend - a former anti-Mosley resistance leader who, rather impressively, has built a cohesive populist republican movement catering not just to the left, but also to centrists and even some conservatives. Mr. Thurtle has consistently proven himself capable of avoiding charges against him: he is not violent, he does not argue for treasonous acts, and he loudly proclaims his faith in parliamentary democracy; he is a Briton and proud to be one. And yet, he wants the monarchy gone. He had already tried to convince the provisional authorities, and then the National Government, of the legitimacy of a referendum on the matter of the monarchy and other wide reaching reforms, and back then he was swatted away.\n\nIt appears his influence hasn't gone away with time. Today, a group of MPs led by Arthur Greenwood have taken advantage of our currently relaxed policy on bill proposals to put forward a set of acts that read eerily similar to Thurtles own proposals shortly after the Restoration. They're the expected list of governmental reforms that Thurtle outlines many months ago; the tweaking of the parliamentary term reforms outlined in the Parliament Act 1911, a potential move towards a european-style Proportional Representation voting system, a redrawing of Royal Prerogatives and, of course, a referendum on the Monarchy. The MPs call it 'an omnibus of progressive legislation to bring our parliamentary systems into the modern age', though it's clear to everyone that it's just a vehicle to introduce a republican referendum into the agenda.\n\nObviously the proposals are radical and arguably treasonous in nature, but several MPs have gotten into Eden's ear over the issue. To them, putting the proposed bills onto the agenda could help to de-radicalise republicans and syndicalists alike, and the Commons has been so stacked with royalists that their more ludicrous proposals will likely never make it out of Parliament. Eden has a simple choice, whether to include the bills on the agenda or not. "

krg_eng.62.t: "The Reformist Debates"
krg_eng.62.d: "Following a prolonged discussion with aides and allies, Prime Minister Eden has decided to lay all cards on the table and open the possibility of discussing several fundamental issues of British politics, calling into question several of the Kingdom's 'un-written rules' for the first time in living memory. Ideas such as Parliaments and Governments serving for fixed terms, rather than \"at the Sovereign's pleasure\", modern voting systems being implemented to better reflect the fractured state of British politics and even the possibility of formally cutting down the Royal Prerogatives enjoyed by the monarch and exerted by the Prime Minister will for the first time be taken to the floor of Westminster, though whether they'll survive there is another question entirely.\n\nThe Prime Minister's hope as that the old system is kept as intact as possible, but with a new coat of \"popular legitimacy\" on it, and that the vote on the Royal Prerogatives might get the people's minds off the Republicans' referendum obsession. Of course, the idea of calling into question everything the system stands for and is based on doesn't sit well with most conservatives, but the King has proven to be surprisingly amenable, and that will have to be enough. After all, the monarchy stands good chances to come out of a parliamentary debate intact, especially with the only suspected republicans being some of Morrison's left, whose former-syndicalist sympathies may come back to the surface."
krg_eng.62.a: "This will be interesting"

krg_eng.63.t: "The Parlimentary Term Debate"
krg_eng.63.d: "Traditionally, the Parliament of the United Kingdom serves for no more than five years, but this limitation can be overridden, replaced or altered by Acts of Parliament (as it has been, constantly, during the Exile) and the rules on its dissolution are foggy at best. Theoretically, it is one of those Royal Prerogatives effectively exerted by the Prime Minister, and this has been the cause of much grumbling about the democratic nature of the whole system.\n\nIn a conciliatory move towards republicans and royalists, the National Government has decided to table the issue of fixed terms and checks on the Government's power to dissolve Parliament. The 'progressives' proposal is fairly simple. They propose a partial renewal of elements of the 1911 Parliament Act pertaining to the 5-year term reforms, but introducing new limitations constricting the dissolution of the Parliament to an automatic, legal mechanic of the new act rather than a simple Royal Prerogative. The question is highly contentious and represents a source of internal divides for just about every political group in Britain, or at least for those represented in Westminster right now. We also have to consider that the people, and entire generations of soon-to-be voting young men and women, have had 23 years to get used to the rigid constitutional discipline of the Trade Unions' Congress, and are likely to use that as the standard of democratic value of the institutions. Of course, the Speaker (with Eden in his ear) doesnt have to table the vote, which could solve a lot of hassle."

krg_eng.64.t: "Voting on the Parliament Act [GetYear]"
krg_eng.64.d: "After much debating, the final vote for the Parliament Act (Definition of Fixed Parliamentary Terms) [GetYear] has been called. The 'progressive' proposal has been taken into account, to much initial backlash. Many counter-proposals were then offered, with term proposals ranging from three to ten years and a whole host of different reforms to the actual mechanisms of dissolving parliament. Often, a proposal received cross-party consensus based more on perceived political convenience rather than a genuine wish for political reform - or so the increasingly daring press outlets complained, anyway.\n\nIn the end, Leader of the Commons the Marquess of Salisbury himself stepped in to, surprisingly, endorse the original proposal and put an end to the endless circling of the older conservative MPs. With seemingly the National Government's support, many more MPs have fallen in line behind the proposal, even though Eden himself is not only personally opposed to the bill, but even prepared to punish the Marquess of Salisbury for undermining the Government's position and emboldening the 'progressive' republicans. Of course, with party whips still non-existent, Eden is powerless to actually stop his own aides voting in favour of the act. Whether the Government defectors will be enough to swing it was unknown however, and when the vote was called no-one could predict the outcome. When the votes were counted, the Speaker cried..."

krg_eng.65.t: "The Alternative Vote Debate"
krg_eng.65.d: "As the discussions on reforming and strengthening our political system continue, a radical new idea has taken the Commons by storm: a sweeping reform of the voting system.\n\nAccording to MP Ernest Thurtle, its initiator, the current simple majority voting system for most constituencies is showing its age, and, in spite of its simplicity, is making the country significantly less democratic than it should be. To this end he is proposing something called the \"Alternative Vote\", a more complicated system involving ranking candidates on the ballot, but which, he claims, is far more democratic than the current First Past the Post electoral system.\n\nWhile the Liberal Alliance and the recently-formed Democratic Labour Parties are coming out in support of this new method, such a radical change is bound to cause controversies, with many Tory MP's claiming that the system actually works just fine and that such a radical change will only confuse people instead of getting them more engaged.

Instead of the voter simply stamping one of the options on the ballot, he will number each one in order of preference. If a candidate earns more than half of all first-preference votes, he wins; if not, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and his votes are redistributed according to his voters' preferences, until a majority is found. All constituencies will move towards this voting system, and resources will be allocated towards a public information campaign, so that the voters will understand the new system come the next elections.\n\nThe whips are corraling their parties' MP's, the Speaker calls out, and the results of the vote henceforth are..."

krg_eng.67.t: "The Royal Perogative Debate"
krg_eng.67.d: "The Royal Prerogatives are the ensemble of powers and rights vested in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, ranging from the regulation of passports to the dissolution of Parliament. The most important of these is perhaps the Royal Assent, necessary for any legislative proposal to become law.\n\nToday most scholars of British law agree that these prerogatives should only be exerted in agreement with the Government, or by the Government itself in the name of the Crown. The 'progressives' are however quick to point out that the Exile has greatly damaged the conventions traditionally keeping in check the monarch's powers. In their opinion, the time has come to consider the abolition of the Royal Prerogatives by law. This would transfer the powers of the monarch to the institutions that conventionally exert them in his or her name and leave the House of Windsor as a dynasty of figureheads, possibly going so far as to exclude the King's participation in Parliament. Of course, what purpose would a power-less monarch even have? Its clear to everyone that this act is merely a segway into a full-blown Republican act, and its met extreme resistance before its even reached the Commons.\n\nUnsurprisingly this is expected to become vitriolic on the Parliamentary floor, and many are advising Eden to remove the debate from the schedule to stop an unnecessary headache."

krg_eng.68.t: "Voting on the Royal Prerogative Act [GetYear]"
krg_eng.68.d: "The time has come for the final vote on the Royal Prerogative Act [GetYear]. As expected, the Commons descended into a bevy of anger and shouting after the Act itself was read out, and it became clear very quickly that such an act would almost certainly be a crushing defeat for the 'progressives'. Reigning back on his initial proposal, Arthur Greenwood returned to the Commons with a watered-down proposal, that would hopefully be acceptable to the generally-conservative MPs.\n\nThe general idea is for it to serve as a basis to settle the matter of the Royal Prerogatives through the higher judicial courts of the realm, rather than eliminating them completely. Here, the Lord Chancellor would be empowered, as being the formal leader of the British justice system they'd be adequately positioned to decipher whether Royal Prerogatives would need to be used, and only endorse them in necessity. Many current actions taken by the King would still be transferred to the Prime Minister, though the King would technically retain most of his Prerogatives.\n\nTo many, the proposal isn't still far too radical. There's a few more MPs onboard with the new proposal, stemming from socialist and liberal circles, but the vast majority are ruthlessly against the progressive's ideas. Some see it as an unnecessary distraction from stable governance, while others question the debate in its entirety. After all, with the King's utmost commitment to public democracy and the Prime Ministers recommendations, is there really a need to 'modernise the system' any more. To most, this is simply a Republican statement wrapped up in formal attire, and as such should be stopped as soon as possible. The vote went ahead, as planned, but the lack of people going to the 'Aye Chamber' spoiled the result. Before the results were proclaimed, a dejected Greenwood had already left the chamber."

krg_eng.77.d: "Since the restoration, British Politics has been dominanted by various informal political movements and factions. This state of affairs stems from a directive from the King months ago, wherein he requested that partisan politics take a backseat while reconstruction and desyndicalisation efforts got underway. While its clear Eden's National Government coalition has successfully ruled the nation through its most difficult times, there are growing calls for politics to finally return to normal. Today, after his weekly meeting with the King, Prime Minister Eden sent a series of letters to known political leaders in the Commons, formally requesting that they form proper political parties to naturally bring the National Government to its end.\n\nIt will likely take a few days for parties to offically be founded, but this request from the Prime Minister indeed means we are well on the way to the General Election."

krg_eng.78.t: "The Reformation of the Conservative Party"
krg_eng.78.d: "In the last few days, there's been speculation as to which political party would form first. Today, the nation was given an answer as Prime Minister Anthony Eden, flanked by a number of prominent conservative politicians; the Earl of Woolton, R. A. Butler, Oliver Stanley and the Marquess of Salisbury, announced the formal reformation of the Conservative and Unionist Party. In his speech, Eden stated the new Conservative Party stood for its 'values of old, One Nation Conservatism'. The Earl of Woolton has been appointed the new chairman of the party, vowing to 'maintain the tradition of Disraeli for years to come'.\n\nAs expected, there's been few surprises. The reformed Tories are very much what they used to be, which is a socially conservative party standing for British Unionism and fiercely opposing socialism. Around half of the currently sitting MPs are expected to join the party, though there has already been backlash from within Parliament. Jo Grimond, a young New Liberal, has derided the Tories for their 'Pig-headed ignorance of the modern Britain', as they attempt to apply those 'values of old' in a very different world. With praise and criticism alike, the conference has generated a lot of attention, and the other parties will likely attempt to outdo Eden's attempts in the coming days."
krg_eng.78.a: "Are they out of touch?"

krg_eng.79.t: "The Formation of the Liberal Alliance"
krg_eng.79.d: "The Liberal Party was historically one of the dominant parties in Westminster, however following the Weltkrieg it fell on hard times. Teetering on the verge of total collapse shortly before the revolution, some political commentators believe that the syndicalist's takeover was the thing that prevented the death of British Liberalism; as the Liberals escaped the crackdowns that the Tories suffered under the Union of Britain, they subsequently acted as a political haven for former Conservative moderates until independent political parties were banned outright in 1932.\n\nAfterwards, the Liberal sphere splintered into a myriad of different underground groups. Most of note were the 'New Liberal' Social and Liberal Reform Group, the more radical Liberal Action, and the conservative Liberal National Organisation. During the Mosley regime, infighting between the liberal remnants was more prominent than opposition against the Maximists.\n\nHowever today, in a conference in Blackpool, a group of politicians representing the various liberal groups announced the formation of the Liberal Alliance, claiming the lineage of Gladstone and Peel and uniting the different organisations into an electoral pact. The leader of the group has been announced as veteran politician Herbert Samuel, currently a member of the National Government. A nationally renowned figure stemming from his 15 years spent as a political prisoner of the Union of Britain, the elder statesman has faced criticism concerning his age, being almost 80 years old. However, Samuel has defied such comments, claiming that he 'wouldn't take the position if he didn't believe he could lead Britain into the future', though he is expected to only seek a single term as an elected Member of Parliament. Whether this new Alliance will be able to challenge in the upcoming General Election remains to be seen."

And today, on [getdate], they have announced the outcome of their deliberations: the founding of a new political party, to be named the Democratic Labour Party, to continue advocating for progress and welfare within the Realm"
krg_eng.80.a: " Hopefully they don't turn traitor like their forebears."

krg_eng.81.t: "Former exiles flock to the Tories"
krg_eng.81.d: "As to be expected the Exiles, now making their triumphant return from Eastern Canada, have come out in force to support the Conservative Party. The aristocrats and Royal Army veterans that fled during the year of 1925-1926 have begun promoting Anthony Eden's brave, measured leadership across Gentlemen's Clubs and more informal gatherings nationwide.\n\nThere is a mild concern throughout the Conservative leadership, however. Rab Butler, the Deputy Prime Minister has made a private, rather damning speech. To him, the Exile population might be behind them, and Eden might hold personal popularity due to the trials and tribulations he has faced during the last couple of moths, but the Tories lack a political foothold across the wider population. He fears the wider party leadership are out of touch, and that the upcoming General Election could be a disaster for Anthony Eden if a clever campaign strategy is not undertaken."

krg_eng.82.d: "A motley crew of Liberal groups, the Liberal Alliance has nonetheless made a big impression on the national stage. Taking advantage of their previously underground political infrastructure, the Alliance has formed devolved political groupings in Scotland and Wales and has already entered campaign mode despite the election still being a while away.\n\nTheir competence and rapid rise in strength has proved surprising to the Prime Minister, who expected the Liberals to remain divided has they had been previously. Clearly, a rather strong "rally around the flag effect" has formed around the popular Herbert Samuel, whose been named the "Beloved Grandfather of the Nation" in this week's issue of The Observer. Where the Cabinet had hoped that the upcoming general election would be an easy victory, it has become clear that Anthony Eden's personal baggage, and the still left-leaning political climate of the country will make a Conservative victory an uphill battle."

Who knew that all they needed to be brought onside was a political choice that they deemed legitimate?\n\nSince Democratic-Labour's foundation, thousands of former syndicalist loyalists have pledged their membership to the organisation, empowering the newly founded political party. This cut-through is only expected to grow over the coming weeks and months. Herbert Morrison is already considered to be a favourite to winning the upcoming General Election, if he maintains this current momentum.\n\nIf anyone questioned the parties claim as the successor to the pre-revolution Labour Party, those doubters have been silenced."
krg_eng.83.a: "Wait, both Herberts are more popular than us? How'd that happen!"

krg_eng.84.t: "Radical Parties Form"
krg_eng.84.d: "Just as a democracy has its main, moderate parties, there are always a litany of radicals and fringe movements which inevitably form. With our main parties now formally operating, these groups have followed suit, and 3 such parties have caught the government's eye.\n\nFirstly, the various Maximist militias and groups that still remain have finally stopped fighting amongst themselves. The largest two movements, the remnants of Mosley's Popular Revolution Party, now led by young ideologue Jeffrey Hamm, and the waning Maximist Front have merged to form the 'Union Movement'. The movement appears to be an attempt to normalise their views, which they have somewhat moderated in order to survive. The Union Movement stands for 'Europe a Nation', the idea of uniting the European Continent under one federal, nominally sorelian banner, and now 'welcomes' democracy, while still outright rejecting capitalist economics.\n\nSecondly, Ernest Thurtle and Arthur Greenwood's 'Free Republican Movement' has finally formed a proper political front. Named simply the 'British Republican Party' they staunchly stand for the abolishment of the monarchy and the creation of a Federal Republic of Britain. Positioned between the Liberals and Democratic-Labour ideologically, there are fears that the Republicans could gain much more steam with their well polished manifesto and speeches.\n\nFinally, a group of British aristocrats and far-right politicians headed by R.B.D. Blakeney and the Earl of Glasgow, who all went into exile in Germany, have announced the reformation of the British People's Party, which had existed briefly during the syndicalist period. Conservative and isolationist, they believe Britian should never get involved in a global war again, and also argue against the continuing polarisation of international politics. The group seems to be a front for covert Pro-German sentiment, though their calls for peace and unity amongst nations is a tempting stance."
krg_eng.84.a: "It's good they're working within the system now, and that we're more popular than someone at least."

krg_eng.85.t: "Shots fired in Birmingham"
krg_eng.85.d: "During a speech pledging peace and loyalty, Anthony Eden was shot by a sniper. The gunman, identified only as a young male, escaped his nest but a UoB-marked Lee Enfield rifle was found at the scene. The bullet was thankfully non-fatal, and Eden is recovering in a hospital. For the next few weeks, Rab Butler will be filling in for the Prime Minister where required."
krg_eng.85.a: "Thank god Eden is Okay!"

krg_eng.86.t: "The Shooter is apprehended"
krg_eng.86.d: "Karl Thorne, 29 year old Maximist ringleader and war veteran is captured after a fortnight long manhunt. Very well connected with Maximist remnants, it took an almost military operation to apprehend him. He's now in custody, awaiting trial."
krg_eng.86.a: "Good work everyone, Eden thanks you all."

krg_eng.87.t: "Surprise Attack in Salford"
krg_eng.87.d: "The assasination attempt on Prime Minister Eden continues to reverberate, and it appears that tensions are ramping up once again.\n\nRecently, a BPLA base in the vicinity of Salford was attacked. The police was alerted to disturbances and gunshot noises by locals, but by the time they arrived at the scene, the guns fell silent, and a smattering of dead militants in pools of drying blood was discovered.\n\nMore concerning than this attack, however, is the fact that, in the absence of governmental activity to shut this group down, the only possible perpetrators could have been the various Ultraloyalist militias connected to the United Empire League. That they are growing so bold does not bode well for easing future tensions."
krg_eng.87.a: "Damned Ultras"

krg_eng.88.t: "Nationalist Militias claim responsibility"
krg_eng.88.d: "Our hypothesis that ultra militias were responsible for the Salford attack just was proven correct by such a grouping.\n\nCalling themselves the \"British Anti-Maximist League\", the group distributed pamphlets throughout the night, and a letter was published in local media outlets, ostensibly by their leadership, in which the BAML claimed responsibility for the recent attack of Salford, even taking pride in what they describe as \"righteous vengeance against those who would dare raise a hand against the rightful Prime Minister.\" They also announced that they will not stop until \"the last Maximist is run into the sea\".\n\nEven if taking out the BPLA may make these radicals useful allies of convenience, we must keep in mind that having such acts tacked on to our Government's cause may play straight into the Socialists' hands."
krg_eng.88.a: "Damn it, you fanatic bastards!"

krg_eng.89.t: "Nationalist-Syndicalist tensions rise"
krg_eng.89.d: "Tensions between the Syndicalists and the Nationalists have been high at the best of times, but the recent BAML raids have inflamed them to new, worrying heights, just as we thought that they were starting to subside somewhat.\n\nThe police force is trying to maintain order across Britain, but it is a tough ordeal to handle, for wherever one attack is prevented, it seems another takes place elsewhere, and another is being planned away from our notice. For every base found, another seems to spring up. And manifestos and pamphlets from each side only continue to proliferate."
krg_eng.89.a: "Very Concerning."

krg_eng.90.t: "Maximist March planned in Manchester"
krg_eng.90.d: "Citing the Government's heavy-handed pursuit of syndicalists and apparent favouritism of Ultra groups when it comes to enforcing the Firearms and Paramilitaries act, a local affiliate of the BPLA, calling themselves the \"Manchester People's Guards\", have announced that they will hold a peaceful protest march in two weeks' time.\n\nWhile it could be easy to just arrest these agitators, it has been reported to us that public discontent over said enforcement of the Firearms and Paramilitaries Act is climbing, and invoking it against an ostensibly peaceful event may further damage our credibility. We have little choice but to let them spread their filth, it seems."
krg_eng.90.a: "Stopping the March would make us look even worse."

krg_eng.91.t: "The United Empire League plans a counter-march"
krg_eng.91.d: "Days after the MPG announced their protest march, a local UEL affiliate group, the \"Manchester Union of Loyalists\", have announced that they will hold a counter-march against their socialist counterparts, citing the need to \"prevent socialist barbarism from taking root in our beautiful Britain and our magnificent city ever again\".\n\nThe group claims that the event will be peaceful, and so far we lack proof that they plan anything else. Yet, tensions continue to rise in Manchester, and many Mancunians look upon the date the groups have chosen to march on with rising fear and trepidation."
krg_eng.91.a: "This could be combustible, keep an eye on it"

krg_eng.92.t: "The Manchester Marches"
krg_eng.92.d: "The dread day has arrived, and both the People's Guards and the Union of Loyalists have taken to the streets of Manchester.\n\nGuided by police along their respective routes, both militant groups seem peaceful so far, with their activity mostly limited to shouting slogans and waving signs.\n\nYet, the side shouting \"Now's the Day and Now's the Hour!\" \"Down with the Government!\" \"End the Unjust Persecutions!\" \"Labour Now, Labour Forever!\" and the one shouting \"For God, King and Country!\" \"Socialism Isn't Freedom!\" \"Monarchy, Not Maximism!\" seem to be approaching one another, with the policemen exchanging nervous glances as the other side's slogans become ever clearer.."
krg_eng.92.a: "Let's hope for a peaceful resolution."

krg_eng.93.t: "Standoff on Princess Street"
krg_eng.93.d: "The slogans became ever clearer. The distant dim of marching men became a louder tumult. And, finally, on Princess Street, in central Manchester, the two sides met.\n\nThe bobbies tried to defuse the situation by talking with the other side's overseers, but the marchers became ever harder to control, seeing each other's opposite so closely, and in such a stark contrast to boot. People began shouting, louder and louder. The police spokesmen tried to calm them down, but tensions rose, and soon enough, the cordons broke.\n\nThe two throngs of men charged each other, and scores were bruised in the ensuing clashes. Some were battered badly, enough to require hospitalisation. Reports are that some may be in critical condition. Control was reestablished after a forceful intervention, but the fallout of this event will be felt for a long time..."
krg_eng.93.a: "We should have stopped them earlier..."

krg_eng.94.t: "The Battle of Princess Street"
krg_eng.94.d: "A full on gun battle erupts in central Manchester. The two groups open fire on eachother, backed up by covert paramilitary units. The Police are quickly overwhelmed by the fighting, resulting in the Army and local non-political LDVGs to be called in. The fighting continues for 4 hours, before peace returned to Manchester. Over 100 were killed, and 400 injured. Its the bloodiest day since the end of the war..."

krg_eng.95.t: "Nationalists & Syndicalists fight across the country"
krg_eng.95.d: "Following the Battle of Princess Street, LDVGs aligned to the Maximists and UEL began fighting across the country. With our army stretched thin trying to elimintate syndicalist holdouts, they cannot adequately stop the violence."

krg_eng.101.t: "The Beveridge Report"
krg_eng.101.d: "After months of work, an inter-departmental committee headed up by known reformist William Beveridge has finally finished creating its report on social reconstruction in Britain. Offically titled "Social Insurance and Welfare Services", the report details "5 giants on the road to reconstruction: Squalor, Ignorance, Want, Idleness and Disease." It goes onto call for a "comprehensive policy of social progress", with Beveridge himself advocating for the formation of a welfare state combined with "a national minimum wage" to help improve living standards across Britain.\n\nReaction to the report has been extremely varied. The Ministry of Information has found the Report has been overwhelmingly popular with the public on all sides, however amongst the politicans feedback has been decidedly more mixed. Many of the ideas within the report are quite socialist-inclined, and some of them have been adapted straight from major plans within the pre-Maximist Union of Britain. Almost to be expected, the proposal has created furious debate within the government; many conservative-leaning polticians have gone as far as label Beveridge a syndicalist. The leftist MPs have backed the proposal however, even if they differ on how it should be implemented. At bare minimum, the Report seems to have bolstered support for the National Government, and the people of Britain are more than excited at the propects of this "Welfare State"."

krg_eng.103.d: "The occupation of the Southern Coast by Generalfeldmarschall Mackensen's army is proving to be a political drag on our re-established government, with small-scale incidents of looting amongst the German's men becoming more widespread. Today, a group of Heer soldiers reportedly raided key industrial estates across Kent and Sussex, under the pretense of rooting out syndicalist sympathisers. It appears they've arrested many more loyalists than Union holdouts, including a pair of newly-appointed civil servants. The Prime Minister is facing growing calls to end the German occupation, especially as we try to clean up the devastation left by Heimdallr."

krg_eng.104.t: "The Bristol Incident"
krg_eng.104.d: "Early this morning, a rather large protest formed in Bristol City Centre. Organised by members of the Revolutionary Syndicalist League, one of the many movements born out of the fallout of Mosley's chaotic capitulation, the protest was meant to be a peaceful one. Publicly, the leaders of the rally were simply opposing the continued German presence on the British Isles, especially with the smouldering wreckage of Portsmouth so clear in the citizen's memory. With a Heer company already garrisoning the city under Generalfeldmarschall Mackensen's orders, the streets of Bristol turned into a powderkeg.\n\nThe protest turned into a bloodbath, with German soldiers firing indiscriminately upon the civilians. It's unclear what triggered the quagmire, but the excessive force directly correlates with Mackensen's brutal occupation of the region. Needless to say, there is outrage amongst Parliament and the people alike. While Eden's reluctance to directly negotiate with the Germans up to this point has been understandable, with this most recent incident the nation has unified for once, if only behind Germanophobia. To this end, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister has announced that talks will be arranged with Berlin to end the illegitimate occupation."

It's unclear what triggered the quagmire, but the excessive force directly correlates with Mackensen's brutal occupation of the region. Britain's people have been set alight with Germanophobia following this international incident. We can't simply recall Mackensen's army from its position of power, especially as Britain hasn't paid for the damages they caused during the Second Weltkrieg. However, it looks like we won't have to act first, as the National Government is organising official talks between London and Berlin to deal with the crisis."

krg_eng.105.t: "Preparing the Oxford Conference"
krg_eng.105.d: "Immediately after the surrender of the Union of Britain, a large German contingent under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Eberhard von Mackensen was dispatched to the British Isles, ostensibly to help our overstretched army and government to keep order amongst the post-Maximist chaos.\n\nHowever, now that the nation is pulling itself together and is slowly becoming capable of policing itself without German \"aid\", and in the context of worsening relations with Berlin, we must figure out a way to get German forces out peacefully. To this end, we have invited a delegation of the Auswärtige Amt to Oxford, to properly talk this issue out.\n\nIt will not be easy. They will probably want concessions, and harsh ones at that. But whatever will come, we will be ready. We clawed our way back from disaster before, and we will get through this as well. In the meantime, we must focus on making Oxford itself presentable."
krg_eng.105.a: "May Britain prevail"

krg_eng.106.t: "The Conference Begins"
krg_eng.106.d: "The day has come. The German delegation, led by Foreign Minister von Neurath and Kronprinz Wilhelm, has arrived. The air buzzes with anticipation as flags flutter in the breeze, and the delegates are welcomed with proper pomp and ceremony – as much of it as we can muster in our state, at any rate. Amidst a grandeur countermanded by ruins, tension and fear understate the proceedings.\n\nAfter the requisite pomp and ceremony, and allowing the delegation to rest for the rest of the day at von Neurath's insistence, the talks are beginning in earnest. Our delegation, appropriately led by Prime Minister Eden himself, is laying forth our principal demands: the withdrawal of the German occupation forces from the South, as well as some commercial stimulants to sweeten the deal.\n\nAnd now, we wait for the Germans' response..."

krg_eng.107.t: "An Invite to the Oxford Conference"
krg_eng.107.d: "Over the past week, the British have hastily organised a diplomatic conference to finally deal with Mackensen's extra-legal occupation of Southern England. The reason Mackensen's army has remained on the isles is obvious to both parties; to secure reparations stemming from wartime damages done by the Union of Britain. As the Union imploded last year, the United Kingdom is now the successor government and thus we are at least entitled to negotiate a settlement with Eden's government. In addition, with our nuclear weapons backing our words, we may be able to go further than simple reparations; Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath's aim is to dismantle the British war economy to secure our position in Europe...\n\nWhatever happens, we've been given an official invite to attend the conference. Observers from Canada and France have also been invited, however the diplomatic discussions will be purely between us and London. Neurath will be joined in Oxford by Kronprinz Wilhelm, as the Kaiser wishes not to attend the conference for personal reasons. The pair will fly to Oxford tomorrow, flanked with a large delegation of diplomats. Ferdinand von Bredow is confident that the two will be able to negotiate a good settlement for Germany, either through diplomacy or more...threatening means."

The Brits so far don't demand too much, only that we withdraw the occupational force from their southern regions, and some minor commercial agreements to sweeten the deal.\n\nOf course, however, while we would want our boys to come home, we also know that it would nullify our sacrifices if we just let the Brits rearm in peace. To this end, we are preparing a vast checklist of concessions the Brits must make in return for our withdrawal: military restrictions, port demilitarisation,the recognition of the African colonial protectorates and a greater opening of the British economy to German goods. To them, it may seem harsh, but we did bleed much during the war. And now that we have guarded our place in the sun, we must make sure we remain there as long as possible; a strong Britain goes directly against that goal, given their historical opposition to continental hegemons..."

krg_eng.109.d: "With our demands having been laid out for the Germans' consideration, the moment has come for that which we dreaded most: their own set of demands.\n\nAnd, just as we dreaded, they are harsh. Citing the need to ensure continental security, von Neurath has laid forth his terms as follows: restrictions on the size of the British Army and on the Royal Navy's tonnage for capital ships, limitations on aeroplane production, demilitarisation of major ports such as Portsmouth, preferential access on commercial goods, war reparations, and a recognition of the status quo in our former African colonies -under German influence and control but with our old administration intact- among others.\n\nNaturally, most members of our delegation are outraged at these demands, and would like to fight for better terms, but some see the harsh reality that we are in no position to struggle, and would rather just see us take the poisoned pill now, and try to rebuild and renegotiate later. Others clamour to fight now and risk a better deal, albeit said deal can also be worse.. .\n\nThe choice is yours, Prime Minister Eden."

We could stay our course and try to get the Brits to see reason, or lessen the demands, just a little bit; albeit that option could hurt us more down the line..."

Our gamble has paid off, and the Germans have agreed to make their demands more lenient.\n\nWhile we still have to adhere to certain restrictions in army size and tonnage, they have been relaxed to a noticeable extent, allowing us to rebuild our armed forces to a greater numerical extent in the future. And while we still have to recognize German influence in what was once British Africa, give them preferential commercial access in some goods and demilitarise certain naval bases, we have wrested some sunset clauses for the demilitarisation in about 30 years, and a lessening in whatever reparations payments we have to pay on behalf of the Union government."

As a result, the terms of the treaty will be harshened with regular inspections to make sure we are keeping our end of the bargain, and the reparations hiked. And making matters worse, a squadron of the High Seas Fleet was sent out on patrol in the North Sea, as a show of power.\n\nThis clear threat has cowed some members of our delegation, but others claim that this act is unacceptable and that we should contact our allies in response to this obvious threat.

Where they differ is in terms of how implied should the state be: with the Democratic Labour Party proposing sweeping nationalisations and a strongly dirigist manner of achieving these goals, alongside a short-term maintenance of rationing, while the Liberal Alliance is more strongly focused on rebuilding foreign trade, public-private partnerships, as well as keeping the deficit under control.\n\nIn spite of their minute differences, it seems that both manifestos have been received positively owing to the public's desire for reform.

However, while the Party leadership agrees, in broad strokes, on certain aspects, a dispute has emerged within its ranks on the topic of social reform.\n\nOne grouping, fronted by Chancellor Rab Butler, is making a strong case that, in order to blunt the advance of the Liberals and Dem-Labourites, the Conservatives should embrace the welfare state model and a mixed economy. While not exactly conventional Conservative policy, Butler argues that conservatism should not mean sticking one's head in the sand; and that embracing such measured change will help the Party remain solvent, and that a fair and strong home front will allow the nation's forces to be focused on the German rivalry.\n\nThe hardliners however are aghast at what they see as soft syndicalization, and argue that watering down Conservatism just because it seems convenient will doom the party, and spit in the face of those who fell in the Liberation.

Though fairly niche around the country, the television market remains untapped of its political potential, which has been theorised as extremely powerful. Usually, political candidates have made election broadcasts on radio, in a bid to reach into constituents homes and directly appeal to them. However, today that all changed.\n\nLiberal Alliance leader Herbert Samuel made a 15 minute-long speech in conjunction with the BBC this evening. In his speech, he heavily criticised both the 'Tories' and the 'Socialists'; the former on their 'headstrong, resistant' thinking of Britain's new position in the world and the latter on their monetary policies. He finished his speech with a summary of the Liberals "Plan for the Future", one of 'meaningful social reform' and mending the 'sinister division between classes that is a great weakness to the country'.\n\nPolitical critics have quickly derided the speech, the Daily Mail going as far as to call it a 'stilted fiasco'. However, the common people who watched it live have come away more positively, swayed by Samuel's 'calm and grandfatherly demeanour'. The broadcast has been a clear success, enshrining the Liberal Alliance as the most forward thinking of the 3 parties. Herbert Samuel may be getting on in years, but he's on the pulse of technological change."

Partisan newspapers are no new thing, as the Union of Britain's state media was so effective in brainwashing the masses. In our case, this support is one of the few things that are actually going well.\n\nIt's no secret that the Daily Mail is strongly aligned with our government, as they were throughout the years in exile. Just last week, Prime Minister Eden had dinner with the Viscount Rothsmere, no doubt to ensure his paper will give us glowing praise over the next few weeks. Sure enough, this week the paper has been publishing a series of exposés on the leadership of Democratic Labour, which mostly means repeatedly calling them unreformed syndicalists until the public gets the hint. Next week will see more of the same, though focusing on the resurgent Liberal Alliance instead. It's a rather crude method of campaigning, but it can be undeniably effective when done right. It's unlikely to stop the socialist's momentum completely, but by informing the public of the correct point of view it should at least make an unwinnable election look increasingly positive for our party."

Even what seem to be traditionally Conservative demographics such as farmers or small business owners seem to agree that the time for change is at hand, and are abandoning us in droves.\n\nThere may be time still before the election starst in earnest, but, even as the Party higher-ups start bickering among themselves, everyone seems to agree: our chances are not looking good."

When the United Kingdom was restored back at the end of 1947, the elder statesmen were seen as the most 'loyal' to the crown and thus the arrangement remained. Our move into electoral campaigning has seen the status-quo be shifted substantially, and a new breed of Conservative has entered the ranks, ones who fought against the syndicalists in the battlefields across the sea, and in the resistance at home.\n\nThe 'Young Tories' are tending to be more accepting of Britains new, diminished place in the world, as well as more accepting of social reforms but are even more intensely nationalistic. The most prominent of them is the war veteran Enoch Powell, who is contesting Wolverhampton South West. Growing up in post-revolutionary Britain, Powell was able to escape to Germany, and later Canada at just 18 years old. He would join the Royal Army in 1939, enlisting as a Private and rising all the way to becoming the youngest Brigadier in the army in 1945. His charisma and intense anti-syndicalism has been highly popular amongst conservative-leaning voters, and members of the parliamentary party are calling for Eden to utilise him across the Black Country, in a bid to mobilise voters to oppose what's expected to be a Democratic-Labour stronghold.\n\nPowell, and others like him, are quickly becoming the new politicians to watch.

Speaking in front of Number 10 for the first time, Morrison's inaugural speech wasn't a bombastic denouncement of the rich and elites as many had feared, but a much more subdued and respectful monolouge.\n\nMorrison spoke about the failures of Syndicalism in a frank manner that surprised even some of his own MPs, claiming "At the time, the Revolution seemed legitimate, even necessary, but I look back on the events that transpired over 25 years ago with a great deal of sadness and regret, for those events ripped our nation apart, and broken it has remained ever since."\n\nFollowing his look at the last three decades that have defined Britain, Morrison turned to the future. An end to the Tories' De-Syndicalisation programmes within the year was guaranteed, and a new sweeping programme of social reform was on the precipice of beginning. Morrison took the time to celebrate the Accord, reassuring our allies abroad that Democratic-Labour was a party of integrity, and would oppose German Imperialism to the bitter end.\n\nAs Morrison re-entered Number 10, no doubt to start outlining his new Cabinet, the journalists of the nation were already picking apart every word Morrison had said, searching for any sign of duplicity or treason. Democratic-Labour were, understandably, under the microscope, and it'd take years for them to regain the trust of the post-war establishment."

krg_eng.163.d: "After their loss in the General Election, the various factions within Democratic-Labour have turned on eachother. Now, the Aneurin Bevan's socialist 'Bevanites', and Evan Durbin's centrist 'Durbinites' are in open warfare, and it's likely that Leader of the Opposition Herbert Morrison will be forced out of his position, if such internal issues arent solved."

krg_eng.165.t: "The [GetYear] Democratic-Labour Leadership Election"
krg_eng.165.d: "Following a period of campaigning, today the Democratic-Labour party is holding an internal vote to decide their next leader. During the last few weeks, three candidates have stood out enough to be put on the ballot. Aneurin 'Nye' Bevan, a former Syndicalist official largely responsible for the UHS (Union Health Service) that inspired the Beveridge Report, and who defected in the dying days of the Union, represents the socialist left of the party. His main challenger is Evan Durbin, a well respected economist and ideologue who controls the centrist right-wing of the party, along with his aide Hugh Gaitskell. Though the two men have a huge amount of power in the party through their factions, many moderate MPs are concerned that either of them winning would result in 'purges', or at worst a full-on party split. To this end, they've put forward Malcolm Macdonald, son of the infamous (and not for good reason) Ramsay Macdonald, and key Parliamentarian figure in the pre-Mosley TUC.\n\nWith the die cast, the three men head into the Democratic-Labour Headquarters in London, along with the vast majority of socialist MPs to decide the parties future. 7 hours later, the Interim Leader William Jowitt exited the building, annoucing the winner, and subsequently new Leader of the Opposition..."

krg_eng.166.d: "Over the last couple of months, new Democratic-Labour leader Aneurin Bevan has embarked on a national tour to establish himself. Though his syndicalist credentials have garnered stiff opposition and worry from Conservative voters, they've proven very popular with leftist voters who as yet havent renounced their Syndicalist ideals.

krg_eng.167.t: "Evan Durbin gains momentum"
krg_eng.167.d: "Over the last couple of months, new Democratic-Labour leader Evan Durbin has embarked on a national tour to establish himself.

It seems the new Democratic-Labour leader is proving rather popular..."
krg_eng.167.a: "Damn that Socialist!"

krg_eng.168.t: "The Legacy of Ramsay Macdonald"
krg_eng.168.d: "Ramsay Macdonald is generally seen as a traitor amongst socialist circles, for his actions during the Revolution. Rather than side with the workers, he chose to remain in London and worked to crack down on the uprising. Though his son, and new Democratic-Labour leader Malcolm Macdonald has repeatedly distanced himself from his father, he's now taken action to fix his late father's hated reputation. These actions, including news stories and other press releases detailing the reasons why Ramsay 'betrayed' the working class, have begun to slowly take hold. It's a slow start, but the new Democratic-Labour leader is dealing with any potential skeletons in his closet..."

krg_eng.180.t: "The Prime Minister falls ill"
krg_eng.180.d: "Ever since the assasination attempt in 1949, Eden has been dogged with ill health. Recently however, he's become increasingly jundicied and sickly looking, to the point where the newspapers are beginning to notice. Eden's personal physician, Horace Evans, has reccomended Eden undergoe a cholecystectomy to remove his gallbladder, which has likely either become cancerous or otherwise filled with gallstones. Eden has resolved to go to his friend, Dr. John Basil Hume, to have the operation carried out at St. Bartholomew's Hospital."

krg_eng.182.t: "The Prime Minister's condition seriously worsens"
krg_eng.182.d: "In the week since the botched operation, Eden's health has rapidally degraded. A loss of appitite and a lack of energy, potentially made worse by his increasing dependence on stimulants, have left him extremely ill. Despite this, Eden has refused to take a break from his role as Prime Minister. In a cabinet meeting today, MPs have urged Eden to resign from the Position of Prime Minister, and doctors have said continued leadership could put his life at risk."

krg_eng.187.d: "With Eden determined to remain at his post despite his increasingly grave condition, the Cabinet have become increasingly concerned.

krg_eng.195.d: "Conservative ministers have privately proposed the creation of a record detailing 'desyndicalised' induviduals to the Prime Minister. Such a record would be an extremely useful tool for the Government as it will allow us to ensure Syndicalists cannot come to positions of influence, outside of known socialist movements, as their past crimes will never be forgotten."

krg_eng.196.t: "Formation of the Anti-Syndicalist Committee"
krg_eng.196.d: "Recently, Desyndicalisation has proved a burden for the Government, so steps to form an autonomous 'National Anti-Syndicalist and Anti-Maximist Committee' have been taken. All de-syndicalisation affairs will be moved over to the Committee, which will be staffed by a mixture of civil-servants and Conservative Ministers.\n\nThere are two options on the table, a moderate committee, headed up by Hugh Lucas-Tooth, or a hardline comittee headed by the young anti-syndicalist Enoch Powell.

krg_eng.199.d: "With the commencement of the Anti-Syndicalist Committee, there has been targetted anger from the opposition benches.

Lucas-Tooth is a firm believer of the idea of mutual de-escalation; If one side stands down then the other will follow suit. As such, Lucas-Tooth's new plans revolve around trying to mercifully bring the remaining Syndicalists to a position of moderation, a more inclusive and moderate stance that Lucas-Tooth hopes will resolve De-Syndicalisation once and for all!"

krg_eng.210.t: "The End of Collective Guilt"
krg_eng.210.d: "Shortly after the Restoration, the idea of 'Collective Guilt' over the Mosley Regime was introduced. This idea stemmed from the rather radical perception that any British citizen that didnt actively oppose Syndicalism and Maximism was equally culpable in its actions, and thus everyone should be punished for their misdeeds. Under the idea of Collective Guilt, thousands of innocent men and women have been ostracised from normal society, with their already destabilised lives made more difficult.\n\nIts clear that this notion was a massively misguided one, with many of those affected having radicalised further as a result, severely hampering De-Syndicalisation efforts. The Lucas-Tooth Committee has announced not only the end to the idea, but a complete reversal of the actions it has caused over the past few years. Speaking in front of Parliament today, MP Hugh Lucas-Tooth has issued an official apology on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Government to those impacted. The social scars will take a long time to heal, but Lucas-Tooth and his Committee has ensured the healing can take place."

krg_eng.249.d: "The once-mighty Republican Navy, pride of the Union of Britain, has met its end. Divided among Germany, Canada, and the French Republic, the fate of its 57 ships was uncertain until now. Canadian and French officials announced that their allotments would be scrapped or recommissioned, leaving the Germans as the enigmatic recipients. In a recent broadcast, the final fate of the German-acquired ships was revealed. Taken to the Indian Ocean alongside vessels from Communard France, Socialist Italy, and German-made ships designated for scrapping, the eclectic fleet was anchored northwest of the Seychelles. An observation post, flanked by Germany's Indian Sector Fleet, stood miles away on a desolate coral and granite stretch. A lone radio operator counted down to zero, triggering an underwater atomic bomb named Njord. The resulting explosion sank most ships near the epicenter, including the French battleship Babeuf and the British cruiser Robert Catesby. Heavily damaged and irradiated, the remaining vessels floated, a poignant testament to Operation Bastion. Beyond a scientific test, it served as propaganda, asserting Germany's nuclear dominance and issuing a veiled warning to Ottawa: play along, or risk the whirlwind."

krg_eng.255.d: "The British People's Party is beginning to gain momentum. With Unity Mitford and other notable party members out campaigning in force, the party was able to win a by-election in the Isle of Thanet. With the recent defection of Canterbury MP John Baker White to the BPP over issues stemming from the lessening of desyndicalisation, they now have a foothold within Westminster. They've already capitalised on this, and are now strongly arguing for the Government to stop backing the Accord and withdraw from the 'reckless Cold War with Berlin'. It is clear their message, laced with conservative, anti-syndicalist rhetoric, is breaking through in the traditionally Conservative areas of the country."

The groom, Philip Mountbatten of Greece and Denmark came to the United Kingdom after the Greek Revolution, and moved further on to Canada following the 1925 British Revolution. Heavily attached to Admiral Louis Mountbatten, Philip served with distinction in the Royal Navy during the Second Weltkrieg.\n\nThe couple had planned on getting married earlier, but the end of the war and move home to Britain had gotten in the way. With reconstruction well underway, nothing like a royal wedding for the future queen to raise morale and increase public opinion towards the monarchy. Despite being married in London though, the couple plans on returning to their home in Canada where the Princess grew up and both have spent most of their time.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by foreign dignitaries from around the globe including Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], President of New England [NEE.GetLeader], President of the French Republic [NFA.GetLeader], German Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, and Austrian Archduke Otto I von Habsburg. With King Edward unlikely to have children, it is widely expected that the Princess Elizabeth will be queen one day, marking a new age in Britain."

krg_eng.301.d: "Almost 30 years ago, in 1925, Syndicalist revolutionaries took control of the Home Isles. The members of the ruling class who weren't caught and hanged quickly fled to Canada, the Empire's most loyal Dominion. The Lords from the House of Lords soon took root in the Canadian government, ensuring the empire remained alive across the Atlantic.\n\nToday, these Lords are back home.\n\nWith Britain liberated from the Syndicalist Menace, these men no longer need to reside in the government of Canada. The boats and planes bringing the Lords home are already arriving on our shores and airstrips, and with them returns the old order."

Funded by citizens of both nations, both governments see this as an opportunity to improve relations between the countries. The shared connections between the UK and New England are many and are vital to the stability of the Accord. This voyage only helps to underscore that."

krg_eng.303.t: "The Filling the Legal Gap"
krg_eng.303.d: "The last proper session of the Parliament was held in 1925. Since then, only a small handful of extraordinary sessions were held in exile. As a result, no real acts have been enacted, causing our legal system to remain stuck in 1925.\n\nWith the return to self-governing and a growing call for the end of marital law, a solution for outdated and unsatisfactory laws is needed. While there is a consensus, what to base the solution on is not widely agreed upon. The most supported idea is adopting modified versions of Canadian laws passed during our exile there. Another idea proposed by members of the radical CRGB is maintaining our current set and only changing what is needed based on examples from continental Europe."

krg_engdemlab.1.t: "Shuffling the Secretaries"
krg_engdemlab.1.d: "Over the last few weeks, the Prime Minister has been reviewing the various secretary positions within our ministry, and a few openings for fresh blood have been found. Appointing new backbenchers to these positions won't drastically transform the party, but they will allow us to nudge the overall government closer to our desired outlook. The only question now is which of these promising backbenchers will get the promotions, and which parliamentary faction will benefit as a result."

krg_engdemlab.2.a: "So much for things being simple."

krg_engdemlab.3.t: "Appointing the Cabinet"
krg_engdemlab.3.d: "For several days, Prime Minister Morrison has deliberated with his fellow ministers and advisors over the makeup of his cabinet. We should have predicted it'd be a contentious choice, but even so it has been a slow and drawn out process, however today is the deadline. Tomorrow, Morrison will meet with the King to officially discuss his cabinet's plans for continuing to rebuild Britain, and a fully fleshed out and established cabinet is vital. Morrison has faced two major problems drawing up the first Democratic-Labour cabinet. One is the overall inexperience of many of our MPs: unlike the Tories, many of whom continued operations in exile, or the Liberals who were greatly organised even in the face of Maximist oppression, Democratic-Labour has brought together a collection of primarily younger politicians, with the experienced ones choosing to remain out of post-restoration politics. In addition, the growing pains of factionalism have frustrated Morrison's original plans for the cabinet, with both sides of the party believing they deserve a larger share of the cabinet.\n\nTo that end, both Bevan and Durbin have submitted their own 'reccomendations' to the Prime Minister over their ideas for the cabinet's makeup. Both men were originally planned to be in the cabinet, with Bevan as Health Secretary and Durbin as Leader of the House of Commons, but both have also pushed for more representation of their allies, and quite controversially in Bevan's case the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is up to the Prime Minister to decide the course of action. Siding with one of the proposals will anger their opposing side, but pressing ahead with his original plans regardless of inter-party developments could cause more anger."
krg_engdemlab.3.a: "We will press ahead with Morrisons' original plans."
krg_engdemlab.3.b: "Take on board some of Bevan's reccomendations."
krg_engdemlab.3.c: "Durbin's reccomendations will be partially accepted."

krg_engdemlab.4.t: "The King and the Socialist"
krg_engdemlab.4.d: "Rumours swirl about the traditionally secretive meetings that Edward VIII and Herbert Morrison have had. Apparently, Morrison has pledged to uphold the current Westminster system for the stability of the nation, ruling out any inkling of republican-driven reform from members of his cabinet. All in all, the King seems reassured about the new government, though still understandably wary."
krg_engdemlab.4.a: "At least the King doesnt hate us. Well, openly anyway..."

krg_engdemlab.5.t: "The End of De-Syndicalisation"
krg_engdemlab.5.d: "De-Syndicalisation is over. The laws put in place are being repealed by Parliament, offices dedicated to the policy are being closed and court cases are being put to bed. It'll take a while to untangle the fallout from the policy, but it'll be done. The Tories have railed against this move as 'crypto-syndicalism', claiming we are protecting enemies of the crown, but for the meantime we seem to have public opinion on our side."
krg_engdemlab.5.a: "This black mark on our history will be erased."

krg_engdemlab.6.t: "Dealing with the 'Offenders'"
krg_engdemlab.6.d: "Though we've pledged to uphold the prision sentences for the most dedicated Maximist and Syndicalist revolutionaries, and commute all crimes that 'Offenders' had been convicted of, a gray area exists with the remaining convicted syndicalists. Though its obvious these people, primarily low-level Republican Army veterans and low-level Trade Union officials, did aid the Syndicalist revolution and subsequently the Maximist war machine, many of them have largely eschewed their radical pasts.\n\nThe Bevanites believe the 'Offenders' should have their crimes wholly commuted, which'll be controversial with the establishment but will garner us a great deal of popularity from the post-syndicalist populace which are largely on our side. The rest of the party opposes this, and believes we should simply halve any prision sentences any Offenders that were handed them still have. Of course, this will prove controversial with certain circles, but we'll be able to smooth out the controversy with relative ease."
krg_engdemlab.6.a: "They've suffered long enough. Commute the sentences."
krg_engdemlab.6.b: "Slash the sentences, but make sure we're still upholding the rule of law."

krg_engdemlab.7.t: "Pushing out the Last Militants"
krg_engdemlab.7.d: "Many thought the rapid end of Desyndicalisation was tantamount to endorsing the values of radicals, and instantly an uptick in Maximist political activity was observed by MI5. For a while, this activity seemingly validated the Tory fears that we were once again a vehicle for revolutionaries to take power, but that notion was put to bed today.\n\nPrime Minister Morrison approved a joint BLUE-Military operation to 'put down' the last holdouts of revolutionaries who had revealed themselves following the amnesty. The news of the events didn't reach the public nor the broad base of the party, however they did reach the King, who congratulated the Prime Minister on finally bringing peace to the Isles. It seems that our government is distrusted just a little less today, following our desicive end to the revolutionary remnants."

krg_engdemlab.10.t: "Pouring over the 1911 Parliament Act"
krg_engdemlab.10.d: "The House of Lords are the biggest thorns in our side when it comes to our reforms, and limiting their influence will go a long way in securing a strong base for our government. However, we cannot simply abolish the upper house of Parliament outright, it'd collapse the government in within days. Instead, the cabinet has poured over the 1911 Parliament Act, long due for an update, to figure out the best course to take in sidelining the House of Lords.\n\nTwo courses of action lay open to us. Currently they can be delayed by up to 3 parlimentary sessions over 2 years, which functionally means any legislation attempted in the final 2 years of a governments term can be stopped from ever seeing the light of day. The conservative approach would be to clear up this obstructionism by halving the Lords' ability to delay any public bills that pass through the House of Commons to one year. However, some Bevanites propose we should take this further, to just one Parliamentary session. Though this would be certainly effective, it could cause uproar within the Lords to see their power so starkly stripped away from them. Whatever happens, it is imperative that we amend the Parliament Act in some way to prevent the aristocrats from putting a premature end to our reformist mission."
krg_engdemlab.10.a: "The original proposal is good enough."

### Military Events ###
krg_engmil.1.t: "The Ministry of Defence"
krg_engmil.1.d: "With the completion of the Preliminary Stages of Reconstruction completed, the Ministry of Defense can once more open it's doors in order to protect the realm and manage the armed services in an effective and efficient manner.\n\nOf course, the state of the armed forces is somewhat tenuous at the current time, with the Oxford Treaty crippling a great deal of the potential Britain has, and those serving at the MoD will have to be careful not to break any requirements, lest we invoke once again the spectre of German intervention in Britain.\n\nStill, this is a first step. May there be many more!"
krg_engmil.1.a: "For the King!"

krg_engmil.2.t: "The New Chief of the General Staff"
krg_engmil.2.d: "With an established Ministry of Defense, the time has come to promote a new Chief of General Staff. We are spoilt for choice in the matter, having three candidates with the vision to lead the Army into the future.\n\nThe first is John Harding, who has served in the British Army since the first Weltkrieg, fighting in Palestine with the Somerset Light Infantry before being posted to India in 1921 and is a stalwart, career officer who has climbed up from the ranks. As time passed and he climbed his way through the ranks he gained a reputation from leading from the front, and taking a keen interest in the wellbeing of his troops.\n\nThe second is Charles Keightley. A cavalry officer who became fascinated by armored warfare. Having known and worked with Percy Hobart before the Syndicalist Revolt, he fled to Canada with the rest of the 5th/6th Dragoons, where he further looked into and explored the idea of 'mobile brigades' further, leading him to lead an armored corps in the Liberation of Britain.\n\nFinally there's Richard 'Windy' Gale, whose name apparently determined his fate. After initially seeking to become an officer in the Artillery Corps but failing due to a lack of qualifications, he served in the First Weltkrieg where his conspicuous gallantry got him promoted to Captain, then, like Harding, was posted to India where he entered the Quetta Staff College, graduating as an officer while British rule in India went through the first of it's final paroxysms. This did not stop him however, and he left to Canada in time to serve in the Second Weltkrieg. His bravery caught the attention of Alan Brooke who put him in charge of the 1st Parachute Division, whose war record would take far too long to go into here, but is shining one.\n\nUltimately all three would do a good job, but the army they would lead will be different compared to their colleagues vision. We will need to choose the vision that will suit Britain's needs."
krg_engmil.2.a: "Promote John Harding"
krg_engmil.2.b: "Promote Charles Keightley"
krg_engmil.2.c: "Promote Richard Gale"

krg_engmil.3.t: "The Question of Syndicalist Officers"
krg_engmil.3.d: "With the ongoing desyndicalisation of the country, there has been a lively debate in the Ministry of Defense about whether or not to allow the service of individuals whose personal history has either been explcitly cleared after an investigation by B.L.U.E agents, or who have been found to be in one of the lower schedules of Syndicalist Affiliation (such as Schedule C - 'In service to, but not ideologically committed to') by the material circumstances of their prior period of service.\n\nSome feel it to be a disastrous idea, that service for the Syndicalist armed forces is a black stain on their record that cannot be expunged, even by a background check and that it would be akin the Americans inviting their Confederate Generals back into the Union Army. \n\nTheir detractors argue that these people have either served their time, or been proven innocent and should be considered to be viable candidates. They also argue we're discarding a pool of talent that could prove valuable, just because of a political opinion they do not even hold any longer."
krg_engmil.3.a: "Allow all 'De-Syndicalised" Individuals to Rejoin the Royal Army"
krg_engmil.3.b: "Only Enlisted Men may Rejoin the Royal Army, not Officers."
krg_engmil.3.c: "We can't have Syndicalists in our ranks!"

krg_engmil.4.t: "General Wingate's Proposal"
krg_engmil.4.d: "General Orde Wingate, who was one of the special forces specialists during the Second Weltkrieg and has developed concepts of 'deep penetration' of enemy territory as well as the 'Gideon band' - a small group of troops able to take on a much larger army through their professionalism and elite spirit has today submitted a document to the Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe 'Commando' paper starts with a short summary of the effective and devastating use of small groups of well armed soldiers that roamed behind British lines during the Second Boer War, explaining the word Commando orignally came from the Boers. He then goes on to discuss counter insurgency efforts in the Sahara desert by the French Foreign Legion prior to and during the Second Weltkrieg in the French Republic, before finally concluding that Britain needs a hardened core of the most elite troops who are able and willing to take on risky manouvres such as infiltration, night operations, paradrop or glider insertion, operating behind enemy lines to disrupt their logistics and even  capture or assassinate high priority targets... essentially an organisation of 'Special Forces' soldiers, who are above and beyond the average trooper in terms of mental and physical conditioning."
krg_engmil.4.a: "Good Idea, make provisions for these 'Commandos' at once."
krg_engmil.4.b: "This sounds rather like the syndicalist 'SAS'..."

###English Diplomacy Events
krg_engdip.1.t: "The Pledge to Accordist Principles"
krg_engdip.1.d: "The Prime Minister today pledged that Britain would, as one of the members of the alliance, of course uphold and promulgate the Accordist Principles around the world.\n\nSome outside of parliament have muttered this is a kowtow to Canadian interests, but ultimately those principles of an open door to any who wish to join and the defensive alliance covered by the 5th Article of Declaration are the ones which managed to return the King to the Throne, and should be celebrated by his government."
krg_engdip.1.a: "Hurrah for the Accord!"

krg_engdip.2.t: "Backlash from Pacifist Groups"
krg_engdip.2.d: "Pacifist groups today staged a protest outside of Downing Street, with members of the crowd calling for Britain to pull out of the Accord and to reject militarism.\n\nThe protest was peaceful, and not particularly well attended but nonetheless it represents a remnant of the strong anti-war faction inside the former Union of Britain. Several members of parliament gave speeches in support of the protestors as well. Still, no overtly illegal material was on display or being distributed and the protestors departed amicably after spending the day cluttering up the arteries of power."
krg_engdip.2.a: "Bloody pinkos! No idea what real politics means!"

krg_engdip.3.t: "The End of \"Empire\""
krg_engdip.3.d: "The harsh reality of it all is that Britain as a global empire will no longer be a realistic proposition. With Germany holding nuclear weapons, and popular movements around the globe rising up to overthrow their colonial masters, only a blinkered idiot would believe that ruling the earth at the end of a barrel of a gun would ever be plausible again.\n\nWe will adapt to the new situation, lay the groundwork for a future where Britain can be the first again, but she will be first amongst equals, rather than an unopposed mistress of the world."
krg_engdip.3.a: "Our ambitions must be reachable."

krg_engdip.4.t: "Dropping our Claims"
krg_engdip.4.d: "With our new ambition to become a global power in the framework of mutual respect and alliance with those who are like minded, as opposed to by force and conquest, there are some matters of diplomatic claims that we have long held.\n\nIt is, to be frank quite simple. We will need to formally repudiate these claims, in the interests of mutual global peace and amity between nations, so that there will no longer be any bad blood. As the Entente Cordiale forged our alliance with France, so too will this open new avenues for Britain."
krg_engdip.4.a: "Better to be friends than enemies, chum!"

krg_engdip.5.t: "Normalise Relations with India?"
krg_engdip.5.d: "The Raj is unfortunately just a memory of many citizens of Britain these days. One that is growing increasingly distant and faded by the passing of time. Where once millions of Indians held up the British Empire, they now chart their own course, under the old foe - the Indian Congress Party.\n\nWe have had to ultimately Quit India, as Gandhi once demanded, but we do not necessarily need to normalise our relationship with our successors there. It is ultimately, our choice to spit in their eye, or shake their hand."
krg_engdip.5.a: "Never! Rule Britannia! Edward is India's Emperor still!"
krg_engdip.5.b: "We must acknowledge reality, normalise relations."

krg_engdip.6.t: "Signing the Anglo-Indian Pact"
krg_engdip.6.d: "With the normalisation of relations between our countries, our diplomats and theirs have completed the negotiations that officially recognise India, renounce all British claims to the territory and acknowledge the eternal friendship between our peoples.\n\nBehind closed doors, we had to fight hard to remove any sort of assertion that Britain had 'set India back' or done any negative things to the country, despite the facts. It is one thing to know it, another thing to actually acknowledge it in a treaty!\n\nNonetheless, we merely need to sign, and all this unpleasantness can be forgotten."
krg_engdip.6.a: "An Eternal War, ended with the Stroke of a Pen."

krg_engdip.7.t: "PM Plans Visit to India"
krg_engdip.7.d: "With our new mutual friendship secured, the Prime Minister has expressed a desire to visit India on a state visit to confer legitimacy on the Nehru government, as well as to shake hands and bury the hatchet as the Americans like to say, in front of the world's press.\n\nThe Indians have expressed interest in having the visit, and no doubt they will carefully choreograph the whole affair to show how far they have come without Britain, and we will have to play the role of pleased parent."
krg_engdip.7.a: "The price of friendship."

krg_engdip.8.t: "The Tour of India"
krg_engdip.8.d: "After two weeks in the sweltering heat of India the PM returned today with a smile on his face.\n\nThe tour of India was a grand success, with Nehru showing him around the Taj Mahal personally, as well as several new factories in Calcutta. There was a dicy moment where the Foreign Minister ate a curry that was too hot for him, but the tour generally went well. Ultimately the whole affair passed without any major embarrassments or one upmanship from the Indian side.\n\nIt appears they are willing to make an honest shake of things, and we should be happy with that."
krg_engdip.8.a: "More Mulligatawny soup at Downing Street then?"

krg_engdip.9.t: "A Flood of Diplomats and Ambassadors"
krg_engdip.9.d: "With the official relegitimisation of Diplomatic offices in Britain, King Edward has been flooded with foreign diplomats and ambassadors seeking to present their credentials to him.\n\nOf course our allies in Canada and France were promoted to the front of the queue. Some members of the Reichspakt sent diplomats as did the Danubian Federation.\n\nNotably absent were the Germans, though it's believed they're waiting for Britain to send someone to the Kaiser first before reciprocating. Such is the way things are done in the old world."
krg_engdip.9.a: "Britannia Returns to the World Stage!"

krg_engdip.10.t: "An Ambassador to Germany" #thanks Carmain
krg_engdip.10.d: "Given the Kaiser has not made the first move, it falls on Britain to extend the olive branch to the German Empire.\n\nAs such, the matter of who is becoming ambassador is somewhat important. We can send someone who will keep the Germans on their toes, such as Ivone Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick is one of the Prime Minister's closest confidantes, and was instrumental in wartime negotiations with the Germans in numerous conferences. Of course, he is highly disliked by the Germans because of that notoriety, but we can trust him to act in the national interest at all times.\n\nIf we seek to be less confrontational, perhaps Gladwyn Jebb would do nicely. Jebb is a trustworthy hand, known for his tact and careful nature. He'd be a fresh face to the Germans, but that means he lacks Kirkpatrick's extensive baggage. In addition by appointing Jebb, a prominent Liberal, we would help to shore up the broad nature of the National Government and ensure our coalition partners stay on board with our political and diplomatic endeavours.\n\nThen of course, we can just use the job in it's traditional sense, as a dumping ground for a civil servant who we are tired of putting out fires for and extracting his boot from his mouth, such as Gerard Wallop. A risky move perhaps, he has close connections with the German upper class, and is believed to be extremely sympathetic to them. Picking him could help reconcile the souring relationship between the two countries, but more than that it'd get his dissatisfactory antisemetic beliefs as far from Parliament as possible"
krg_engdip.10.a: "Ivone Kirkpatrick is just right!"
krg_engdip.10.b: "Gladwyn Jebb, he's a diplomatic man"
krg_engdip.10.c: "Gerard Wallop, as soon as possible!"

krg_engdip.11.t: "Britain Opens an Embassy in Berlin"
krg_engdip.11.d: "The British have recently acquired a property on Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin, and have sent there an ambassador who has presented his credentials to the Kaiser.\n\nIt would behoove us to send back our own ambassador, as it seems Britain is now moving out from under the shadow if her Canadian 'liberators'.\n\nThere of course remains the question of whether we can do business with the former Syndicalist power, but it does look as though the British government is secure in it's own right. For the time being..."
krg_engdip.11.a: "We'd better send someone to London..."

krg_engdip.12.t: "The Commonwealth of Nations Concept"
krg_engdip.12.d: "First proposed by Jan Smuts in 1917 and now more needed than ever after the abeyance of the former Imperial Conferences with the collapse of the British Empire after the traitorous revolution of 1921, the Commonwealth of Nations concept provides the legal and societal understanding necessary for the continuation of the affiliation of Britain and her successor states.\n\nThe concept states that essentially \"the United Kingdom and its dominions agree they are equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations\".\n\nWith this free association and alignment under the British Crown, of which the current holder is King Edward, the Commonwealth will allow Britain to once more connect to the other parts of what was once her Empire, from which she has been severed for so long. It also provides a method by which we can hopefully rebuild and project British influence around the world."
krg_engdip.12.a: "A great idea!"

krg_engdip.13.t: "Publicising the Commonwealth Plan"
krg_engdip.13.d: "With the Cabinet on board with the idea, the Government has decided to publicise the plan so that the public can be better informed on the matter. This publicisation will involve full page adverts being taken out in all national newspapers, and members of Parliament have been given the opportunity to question and query the plan so that it might be conveyed to the public with it's full associated benefits.\n\nThe short version, as it stands is that Britain has a great asset in the Crown and person of King Edward, and that by leaning on that association that we share with the Crown Dominions like Canada, South Africa and Australasia as well as others, we can rebuild and project national influence around the world once more as the First among Equals of this organisation."
krg_engdip.13.a: "Long live the King! And the Commonwealth!"

krg_engdip.14.t: "Planning the London Conference"
krg_engdip.14.d: "With the foundation of the Commonwealth Institute at the newly refurbished Marlborough House and the newly legitimised presence of foreign embassies and diplomatic offices in London, we are now exceedingly well positioned to hold a meeting of heads of government from those states that may wish to be part of the Commonwealth. We must first however ensure that suitable accommodations are prepared for their visit, that there is a suitable location for them to meet at (perhaps his Majesty may be willing to loan Windsor Castle for the occasion?), and to ensure that the King has time in his diary to make an appearance for this meeting in order to cement the deal.\n\nThe task will not be a small one, but a dedicated team of civil servants at Marlborough House are working around the clock to get everything ready."
krg_engdip.14.a: "His majesty's diary... oh dear..."

krg_engdip.15.t: "Inviting the Leaders"
krg_engdip.15.d: "The preparations have been finalised, the plans have been made. A suitable location has been secured and his Majesty the King has agreed to make time in his schedule of Pheasant Shooting to attend the inaugural conference of the New British Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or as the civil servants in Marlborough house have taken to referring to it, if rather unwieldily), 'CHOGM'.\n\nThere are plans for this to be the first of many such meetings, but that will only happen if it goes well, and if the invitations are dispatched."
krg_engdip.15.a: "Better send them First Class!"

krg_engdip.16.t: "Invited to the London Conference"
krg_engdip.16.d: "Diplomatic mail received today from Britain has extended an invitation to the Head of Government to attend the Commonwealth Institute's London Conference in two weeks time from receipt of this letter. The King himself will be making an appearance and as a British Crown Dominion, our leader has been invited in order to participate in this key meeting of allied states in order to reconnect, co-ordinate our efforts and crucially, plan our next moves for the coming years.\n\nAll in all it looks to be a memorable event, that nobody could contemplate missing out on."
krg_engdip.16.a: "Pack my bag! I'm going to London!"

krg_engdip.17.t: "The [GetYear] London Conference Begins"
krg_engdip.17.d: "With the arrival of all the leaders of the Crown Dominions, and them being settled in their accommodations, as well as having met with the King, we can now open the champagne and start the serious talk of what our mutual future will look like.\n\nAlready discussion floats around about diplomatic strategy, Commonwealth Citizenship as a replacement of 'British Subject' on passports and closer economic and social developments between our countries. Perhaps even a student exchange programme or two. \n\nThe mood is jovial as the [GetYear] London Conference gets underway."
krg_engdip.17.a: "Welcome Gentlemen."

krg_engdip.18.t: "Floating an IEDC Successor"
krg_engdip.18.d: "The IEDC was a great and useful arrangement throughout the 1930's and 1940's but with the Commonwealth Institute now set up, it perhaps will be needing a new name and a more flexible, collaborative approach. Especially since both Canada and Britain will be able to serve as poles for the organisation, rather than having it be a case of one handing out and the others taking from it.\n\nInstead a new IEDC successor organisation, some kind of... Commonwealth Industries Association perhaps, will provide mutual aid and support between our nations."
krg_engdip.18.a: "Sounds good to me..."

krg_engdip.19.t: "A Common Diplomatic Strategy"
krg_engdip.19.d: "In this world of the Kalterkrieg, it is more important than ever that we all pull together as a team.\n\nIf Britain is to succeed in the world, indeed if all the nations of the Commonwealth are, we are going to need to work together to overcome the obstacles and injustices that we find. It is more than reasonable to expect some compromise and co-operation on matters which affect all of us equally.\n\nTherefore it makes plain sense that a Common Diplomatic Strategy for the Commonwealth nations will allow us to make sure our voices are heard, both inside the Accord and outside of the alliance, globally."
krg_engdip.19.a: "Very fair idea."

krg_engdip.20.t: "Ratifying the Commonwealth"
krg_engdip.20.d: "With all the heads of government in one room, it is obvious that we can agree a working idea on the principles and concepts of the Commonwealth and how we wish to proceed in the future. The deal is all but done, but unlike the Imperial Hun we have a functional democracy at home waiting.\n\nThus we shall take this proposal and ratify it through a vote in the respective parliaments of our countries, with countries acceding to the organisation the moment the ratification has been completed."
krg_engdip.20.a: "Excellent."

krg_engdip.21.t: "The Commonwealth of Nations is Formed"
krg_engdip.21.d: "With the agreement in principle in place, the London Conference starts to draw to a close. For the waiting pressmen outside however, the Prime Minister has big news.\n\nHe is proud to announce the official formation of the Commonwealth of Nations, with an open door policy and economic clout to both make Britain great again, and to bring the Crown Dominions up with her. The Prime Minister was quoted as saying 'A rising tide lifts all ships'."
krg_engdip.21.a: "A rising tide indeed!"

krg_engdip.22.t: "The Commonwealth Industries Association"
krg_engdip.22.d: "With the announcement of the Commonwealth, those at the IEDC today learned they were now members instead of the Commonwealth Industries Association (or CIA).\n\nThis restructuring of the idea and it's new headquarters with the Commonwealth Institute in Marlborough House will allow for the members of the Commonwealth to meet and freely trade technologies, share information pertaining to trade and to co-ordinate economic strategy to remove wastefulness and increase efficiencies.\n\nThe CIA will also be able to levy Commonwealth countries leadership on matters such as customs and economic preference."
krg_engdip.22.a: "Things can only get better!"

krg_engdip.23.t: "Invitation to the Commonwealth"
krg_engdip.23.d: "The United Kingdom invites ut to the Commonwealth of Nations."
krg_engdip.23.a: "Back to London we go!"
krg_engdip.23.b: "No Thanks Mate"

krg_engdip.28.t: "The Isle of Man Question"
krg_engdip.28.d: "Having held sovereignty over the Isle of Man since the revolutionary fervor that gripped our English bretheren in 25', with the retaking of the home isles, and the crown now having taken its rightful place over Britannia, the English have come forward to us about one glaring issue over the island.\n\nWhat the English delegation put forward was that due to the islands under the settlement act of 1765, the English monarch was enshrined with the title \"Lord of Man\", and given that revolutionary tensions in the isles have subsided, it is peramount to the nation's pride and territorial security to have these islands returned.\n\nWhether or not we accept the terms they put forward is up to us to decide, however, we must keep in mind that the islanders have taken a liking to Canadian virtues and adopted even the national anthem, with many manx having intermingled with Canadian troops during the prolonged use of it as a naval base."
krg_engdip.28.a: "We can negotiate about this."
krg_engdip.28.b: "Man is too important to us."

krg_engdip.29.t: "Isle of Man Negotiations Fail"
krg_engdip.29.d: "Expecting the Canadians to respond to our sound demands for the return of the isles, it appears our lay expectations where ill put, with them rudely refuting our terms, implying that the crown had no right to aggressively in their eyes, revoke their control over it.\n\n With this, it is clear that negotiations have broken down, and that we must bide our time for the time being till we can reclaim the isle from the rebellious Canadians."
krg_engdip.29.a: "Darn!"

krg_engdip.30.t: "Canada Agrees to Manx Negotiations"
krg_engdip.30.d: "After patiently waiting for a response from the Canadians, the commonwealth delegates reported that the Canadian government is willing to negotiate terms for placing the Isle back in the hands of the crown, though noting that many Manx on the isle have grown accustomed to Canadian presence, stating that Canadian interests are intertwined with the Manx's wishes of national pride.\n\nClearly the Canadians expect to be on equal terms in the negotiations, which reportedly has elicited a sour response from the head monarch, though it is up to the heads of government whether or not we shall play hardball or not with our Canadian allies."
krg_engdip.30.a: "We should ask for full control."
krg_engdip.30.b: "We should try and compromise."

krg_engdip.31.t: "Britain wants Full control over Man"
krg_engdip.31.d: "Having anticipated reasonable terms by the crown over the issue of the settlement of the isles, [CAN.GetLeader] was astonished to hear what the diplomatic envoy from the English had to say, rudely issuing an edict that implied all Canadian troops and envoys on the island were to be removed, with the choice of said troops either falling under English command, or to be evacuated to the dominion, stating that the island was unequivocally the crown's territory, and that the civil strife that had gripped the islands, having now subsided, means that Canadian presence in the area is unnecessary.\n\n Having almost initiated a brawl with the delegate that had bequeathed such nasty terms to our leader, reality started to settle in: though we rightfully have defended the isles and deserve to administer it in some capacity, to fight over a rock at the expense of the crown, potentially lead to irreparable harm to our relations within the commonwealth, so our response should be very carefully worded..."
krg_engdip.31.a: "We have no need for it anymore."
krg_engdip.31.b: "We must retain control."

krg_engdip.32.t: "Canada Agrees to Manx Handover"
krg_engdip.32.d: "Though negotiations started off on a rocky footing after the Canadians were initially taken aback at our request for full control of the island, an agreement has been reached between us and the Canadian government regarding control over the Isle of Man.\n\nThis agreement gives us full control over the island, with the withdrawal of Canadian troops and envoys back to mainland Canada set to begin next week. While reaction to our diplomatic victory has been largely muted across the Isle of Man itself, in London, both the government and Edward VIII are jubilant at the return of yet another piece of rightful British territory."
krg_engdip.32.a: "Hurrah!"

krg_engdip.33.t: "Establish a Manx Prison Camp?"
krg_engdip.33.d: "Following the return of the Isle of Man to British control, a debate within the government about the future of the island has become prevalent.\n\nMore anti-syndicalist members of the government have voiced a desire to see a prison camp built on the island to house the remaining imprisoned syndicalists and other dangerous criminals. They argue that the island's distance from England itself will mitigate the chances that any escaped convicts will be able to make it back to England proper. They also assert that the camp will create opportunities for employment among the local population, whether those jobs be prison guard positions or other supporting jobs.\n\nOther members of government, however, contend that building a prison camp full of dangerous criminals will only make keeping those inmates incarcerated more difficult, as violence among the criminals themselves will be frequent. Additionally, they argue, placing a prison camp in such a large and rural area will allow escaped inmates to better evade recapture and potentially leave the island and make it back to England proper."
krg_engdip.33.a: "It is the perfect place!"
krg_engdip.33.b: "There is no need."

krg_engdip.34.t: "Britain Offers Man Compromise"
krg_engdip.34.d: "With the return of the English envoy from London, bearing both gifts, and, more importantly, sound terms, the negotiations started to take place in the head of state's office.\n\nThe proposed terms put forth by the crown stated in short that the crown recognized the valiant efforts of Canadian liaisons and personnel to safe guard the isles from radicals that had tainted the crown, and that the crown would accept both Canadian and English flags to be hoisted on equal horizons, that both Canadian and British troops would be stationed on the island under a \"Manx operational unit\", and that a referendum on the national anthem of the isles would be conducted at a later date for the Manxians to vote on.\n\nWith such agreeable terms being put forth by the crown, our enraptured diplomats were clear on the message to the crown."
krg_engdip.34.a: "This is perfectly reasonable."

krg_engdip.35.t: "Canada Agrees to Manx Compromise"
krg_engdip.35.d: "Realizing that we would be willing to negotiate on an equal footing with our Canadian bretheren, the diplomats from both sides have come to an agreement to have not only control of the island put in the crown's hands, but to guarantee Manx and Canadian interests, and to promise a referendum on the national anthem in due time.\n\nWith such a resounding success, we have concluded agreeable terms for both our government and our Canadians initially reluctant to cede control, now blissfully in agreement."
krg_engdip.35.a: "Hurrah!"

krg_engdip.50.t: "Examining the Oxford Treaty"
krg_engdip.50.d: "The Oxford Treaty represents the German boot on the neck of Britain. We will never, ever be able rebuild our strength or regain our glory if we are forced to suffer under this injustice, this indemnity, this outrage of a document that was signed under duress, looking down the barrel of atomic annihilation.\n\nBritain must be free once more. Britons must not be enslaved in this way... Britain will be free. As any lawyer will tell you, any document has loopholes. It's all about the language used and the terms and conditions. Today, the Prime Minister officially authorised an intense study of the treaty in both the original German and English version in order to find any discrepencies, loopholes, typographical errors or other exploitable means to legally abrogate the treaty without leaving us open to German interference.\n\nThe team working on the project have been sworn to Secrecy and only the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are even aware of their work. To anyone else, the 'Avalon' team are a group of auditors in Whitehall, which gives them exactly the access they need, without raising any suspicions."
krg_engdip.50.a: "Commence Government Operation 'Avalon'"

krg_engdip.51.t: "The Avalon Paper"
krg_engdip.51.d: "The document is a crisp sheaf of paper wrapped in a blue file folder that can't be more than fifty pages thick that was sitting on the Cabinet meeting room table in Downing Street. Inside is a rather dry text laying out the methodology, material studied and the conclusions of the authors. Such is the secrecy around this document that all copies were typed by the author and bound using treasury tags rather than allow the civil service typing pool to see the details within. The conclusions section of the contents has been circled in red ink and the key sheet of paper has it's corner folded over for quick access.\n\nThe page itself reads. \"Under Provision 3B of the Oxford Treaty, we the authors have found a loophole whereby if a 'serious threat to national security' were to arise or occur within the demilitarised ports (such as Southampton, Portsmouth, etcetera), then Britain would be within her rights to a) Completely Withdraw from the Oxford Treaty and b) Remilitarise those ports in order to combat the threat therein. It is very likely that the Germans would be very unhappy about this, but it is a spirit of the letter way out of the 'agreement'.\"\n\nThis information is literally explosive, and the Cabinet have been looking between one another ever since they had each read it, agitation and excitement on their faces. But all eyes are on the Prime Minister when he enters the room. It's obvious he's already aware."
krg_engdip.51.a: "Well gentlemen... What to do..."

krg_engdip.52.t: "The Rumblings of a Plot"
krg_engdip.52.d: "With the decision taken to launch a false flag, it did not take long for MI5 agents to actually discover a legitimate terror threat against a manufacturer of plimsolls in the demilitarised port town of Southampton.\n\nThe syndicalist terrorists are poorly organised however, and our agents are going to spend as much time debating the fine intricacies of Syndicalist political theory as they are on how to make fertiliser bombs. Fortunately we have a way in to their operation, and we can prepare an agent to infiltrate them as well as set up some handlers and our own intelligence infrastructure in the area. Hopefully they don't get picked up by the local police force in the meantime..."
krg_engdip.52.a: "Keep tabs on their operations, Director."

krg_engdip.53.t: "Britain's 'Avalon' Paper"
krg_engdip.53.d: "The British government have forwarded the Avalon Paper, a secret government-written plan to cause an event that would allow the British government to legally circumvent and withdraw from the punitive Oxford Treaty. Whilst there are many amongst our government who are pleased at the idea of Britain getting out of the Oxford Treaty, the loophole described will involve some serious legwork on the part of their internal intelligence services.\n\nThe bottom line is : If the British government is preparing a belligerent move against the Germans, then we need to be ready to support them."
krg_engdip.53.a: "Fingers crossed chaps."

krg_engdip.54.t: "The Infiltration Order is Given"
krg_engdip.54.d: "With the discovery of the Southampton terror cell, the Director of MI5 has informed the Prime Minister of the situation there. It did not take him long to sanction the activity of MI5 operatives to infiltrate the syndicalist terror plot.\n\nOnce our agents are in place, they will be able to shift the nature of the plot towards our own goals, but these things take time. Fortunately the terrorists, who have been under observation for some time, seem not to be going forwards particularly quickly. They do however have some external connection with a loose organisation of red terror cells from further up the country, so we will be able to place our infiltrator as a 'friend from up North'."
krg_engdip.54.a: "Awreet pet?"

krg_engdip.55.t: "Infiltration Successful"
krg_engdip.55.d: "MI5 have successfully got their man on the inside of the Southampton Terror Cell and he has already nudged them toward taking more concrete steps to commence their attack on the government installations in Southampton port. With this sort of progress ongoing on a regular basis, we can expect them to strike soon, so we will need to begin making the threat of such terror cells an ongoing political conversation, to lay the ground for the news to come."
krg_engdip.55.a: "Ring the Home Secretary..."

krg_engdip.56.t: "Stoking the Flames"
krg_engdip.56.d: "The Home Secretary has been making a series of increasingly aggressive and urgent statements in the press, and the House of Commons pertaining to the existence of radical syndicalist terrorists within the country operating under the banner of \"Mann's Army\", and alluded to our present inability to fight them properly due to the onerous terms placed upon our government by the Oxford Treaty.\n\nCurrently however the Prime Minister has made no official response to the controversial statements, they've gained traction among parts of the public, as the press cover the topic with increasing detail. The German Ambassador is reportedly furious.\n\nMeanwhile our 'friend' in Southampton reports the terrorists are growing both emboldened and impatient by the chatter in the newspapers, and that we should expect 'enemy action' soon."
krg_engdip.56.a: "The people are a powerful weapon."

krg_engdip.57.t: "Minimising Collateral"
krg_engdip.57.d: "With our 'friend' on the inside of the terror cell guiding their timing and where they are targetting, we've organised a civil service excursion day for the Southampton office to the beach at Brighton on the planned day of the attack, in order to minimise collatoral.\n\nThe official reason is that it is a team-building exercise, and they're part of a pilot scheme to see if these kinds of things are actually value for money, or if they're just an excuse for the employees to go to the pub.\n\nWhat they don't know is that a team of special MI5 'janitors' has been there the past few nights already, packing the base of the building with 'emergency supplies' of diesel for the recently installed 'backup' generator there, so that when the bombs go off, it will trigger a truly huge explosion."
krg_engdip.57.a: "They're going to think they're so lucky."

krg_engdip.58.t: "The Day"
krg_engdip.58.d: "The city of Southampton was today rocked by a massive fertiliser bomb explosion that levelled a government installation and broke windows in a three mile radius.\n\nThere were few casualties as the workers in the building attacked were on a team-building exercise in Brighton at the time. Several people did die in the explosion, and tens of people have been injured by falling glass and other shrapnel. The number of dead however including one of the terrorists, a Southampton local with a history of syndicalist activity named John Lewis, who was found near to where a shard of glass had plunged into his neck and he had subsequently bled to death.\n\nThe BBC have already got a reporter there and national radio and televisual news coverage on the situation has already begun. The Prime Minister is due to make a short statement on the matter from 10 Downing Street this evening."
krg_engdip.58.a: "On this dark day..."

krg_engdip.59.t: "Bombings in Southampton"
krg_engdip.59.d: "A series of extemely large explosions have gone off in the Demilitarized Zone in the British port town of Southampton.\n\nNeedless to say, this isn't good for British national security and it raises concerns about other attacks in the country in the near future by the Syndicalist organisation their Interior Minister has been talking about a lot recently.\n\nClearly, their government is struggling under the weight of extremism!"
krg_engdip.59.a: "Get our diplomat to send his sincerist apologies."

krg_engdip.60.t: "Carrying Out The Contingency"
krg_engdip.60.d: "The Prime Minister today greeted the House of Commons in order to give a speech on the state of national security in the light of the Southampton bombing.\n\nThe House of Commons was unusually quiet for once and as the speech went on the Prime Minister's tone turned increasingly fiery, first discussing the shock and dismay he had that terrorists were able to operate so brazenly and with such success in Britain and then he began to talk about the role of the security services, and the rearmament of Britain as her only hope of national security. As he went on, the House of Commons roared their approval of each statement, until finally, he pounded the lecturn and said 'I move that Britain formally withdraw from the Treaty of Oxford under Provision 3B, National Security and I ask my right honourable colleagues to vote on the matter immediately'.\n\nThe entire house got to their feet, and when the vote came back from the lobbies, it was nearly unanimous."
krg_engdip.60.a: "Your move, Germany."

krg_engdip.61.t: "Britain Withdraws from Oxford"
krg_engdip.61.d: "We have just received news that the British government have, on the utterly spurious grounds of some bomb going off in a port town, withdrawn from the Oxford Treaty under the national security provision! That would be all well and good but it appears their Accord allies are supporting them in this endeavour!\n\nThe Kaiser is, understandably, furious, and wants to know what our course of action will be with regard to this blatant act of disregard for international law, and the might of the German Empire!"
krg_engdip.61.a: "Britain is still a weak nation. Let them have it."
krg_engdip.61.b: "Mobilise the Kaiserliche Marine! Nobody crosses us!"

krg_engdip.62.t: "Germany abandons the Oxford Treaty"
krg_engdip.62.d: "The German Empire has made no move aside from a diplomatic complaint by their ambassador in London about the abrogation of the Oxford Treaty!\n\nIt appears they are uninterested in pursuing the matter further, and the gamble by the British government has proven to be a successful one. Britain is no longer chained to Oxford!"
krg_engdip.62.a: "What a joyous day!"

krg_engdip.63.t: "The Oxford Treaty is No More"
krg_engdip.63.d: "The German Empire has made no move aside from a diplomatic complaint by their ambassador in London about the abrogation of the Oxford Treaty!\n\nIt appears they are uninterested in pursuing the matter further, and the gamble by the British government has proven to be a successful one. Britain is no longer chained to Oxford! The Brits are Free!"
krg_engdip.63.a: "Hip hip hooray!"

krg_engdip.64.t: "Approval Ratings Skyrocket"
krg_engdip.64.d: "The government's approval rating has come back from the dead. With the cancellation of the Oxford Treaty, most people polled in a recent Manchester Guardian poll responded favourably to the government, with several explicitly stating that their successful rolling back of the unjust Oxford Treaty was the reason that they had changed their mind in support of the government.\n\nWhat the future holds is still unclear, but is seems right now, a lot of people are very happy with those in charge, and the Prime Minister would be well justified a snifter of brandy."
krg_engdip.64.a: "We saved Britain!"

krg_engdip.65.t: "The Kaiserliche Marine Mobilises"
krg_engdip.65.d: "We're receiving reports that the German Imperial Fleet has been seen leaving port at full steam toward the English Channel.\n\nOur troops, such as they are, are going on high alert as the country edges towards high tension. The Prime Minister is currently meeting with the cabinet to determine the next steps, as all of Britain hold their breath."
krg_engdip.65.a: "Our bluff has been called, we must negotiate..."
krg_engdip.65.b: "We will not back down!"

krg_engdip.66.t: "A Familiar Negotiation"
krg_engdip.66.d: "Once again, we are back at the table with the Germans, negotiating over the terms of Oxford once again. Should we ask the Germans for favorable terms or agree to respect the treaty as it stands?\n\nThis seems like an opportunity to, at least try and wriggle out of the more onerous terms, and one that we should take. But we must be mindful of the German battleships offshore..."
krg_engdip.66.a: "Ask for Favourable Terms"
krg_engdip.66.b: "Agree to Respect Oxford"

krg_engdip.67.t: "Britain Agrees to Respect Oxford"
krg_engdip.67.d: "The British Government's position was one of weakness, and they recognised that in the negotiation by sparing us all another endless back and forth, and promising to respect the terms of the Oxford Treaty, as they were written.\n\nThere is no more need for our posture of strength here, it has worked."
krg_engdip.67.a: "Gott mit uns!"

krg_engdip.68.t: "A Hard Bargain"
krg_engdip.68.d: "Once again, we are back at the table with the perfidious British, negotiating over the terms of Oxford once again... We should not be, but they made a point of breaking their way out last time. And now they have the nerve to ask for easier terms.\n\nAre we going to be magnanimous with dealbreakers? Or should we remind them that our fleet is poised to fire on the South Coast and they should take the deal as it stood last time."
krg_engdip.68.a: "We can afford to be generous..."
krg_engdip.68.b: "No, time to eat humble pie!"

krg_engdip.69.t: "Germany Agrees to Favourable Terms"
krg_engdip.69.d: "Even the mighty German Empire can recognise when it has perhaps bitten off more than it can chew. They seem willing to allow Britain to have lighter terms, in the hope that having some terms still is better than having none at all.\n\nIt seems like we have managed to pull of a bit of a trick, though not as great as the one we would have liked."
krg_engdip.69.a: "A great diplomatic coup nonetheless!"

krg_engdip.70.t: "Crisis in the Channel"
krg_engdip.70.d: "The Brits renounced the Oxford Treaty and now the German Navy are steaming toward the English Channel. It all depends on our decision next. If we back the British, we could start another world war. If we don't back the British, we'll be leaving our allies out to hang.\n\nWhat should we do?"
krg_engdip.70.a: "We are brothers in arms. Send the navy!"
krg_engdip.70.b: "We cannot support them..."

krg_engdip.71.t: "Left Out in the Cold"
krg_engdip.71.d: "Our generous 'brothers in arms' the 'liberating' Canadians have left us out to hang. They will not commit Accord Naval elements to the English Channel and now we face the Germans alone. We don't stand a chance, and we're going to have to agree to the Treaty again once more.\n\nThis really is a bitter pill to swallow, and represents the dashing of hopes for millions of British people, as well as showing the world what a weak and hollow alliance the Accord really is, when it comes down to the wire."
krg_engdip.71.a: "Worse than useless..."

krg_engdip.72.t: "The Accord Mobilises"
krg_engdip.72.d: "We have received reports of Canadian and other Accord ships entering the English Channel. It appears their alliance is more than a paper tiger as they are moving to intercede in our movement towards Britain.\n\nObviously we have naval superiority for the time being, so we have no doubt as to the next step, but it seemed appropriate to inform you of the situation's progression."
krg_engdip.72.a: "Stand Firm!"

krg_engdip.73.t: "The Germans Stand Firm"
krg_engdip.73.d: "Perhaps unsurprisingly the Kaiserliche Marine has not deviated from it's positions in the English Channel. We have a decision to make.\n\nDo we continue this game of chicken, with the stakes growing ever higher, and tensions rising on both sides? \nOr do we blink, and leave the British to suffer under the punitive Oxford Treaty again?"
krg_engdip.73.a: "We must back down!"
krg_engdip.73.b: "Stand Firm!"

krg_engdip.74.t: "The Accord Retreats"
krg_engdip.74.d: "Just as we suspected. The Accord navy are withdrawing from the English Channel, a paper flotilla of little boats unable to stand up to a real navy. \n\nThe might of the Kaiserliche Marine goes unquestioned still, and Britain will once again be made to bend the knee and accept the price of the Oxford Treaty."
krg_engdip.74.a: "Gott mit uns!"

krg_engdip.75.t: "The Accord Retreats"
krg_engdip.75.d: "The Accord Navy barely got into the channel before the Canadian Admiral in command got cold feet and called a general retreat.\n\nWe've been hung out to dry by our allies and now we will have to take back the Oxford Treaty."
krg_engdip.75.a: "Damn them! Damn the Germans and the Canadians!"

krg_engdip.76.t: "Standoff in the Channel"
krg_engdip.76.d: "The Accord are either crazy or convinced they can win, because their navy has now moved to directly oppose our naval forces in the English Channel.\n\nWhile our Admirals are confident in our men and our ships, there is a rising concern that if we're not careful, we could start something bigger here, just for the sake of keeping the British down. \n\nIs that a price worth war?"
krg_engdip.76.a: "We do not start wars, we end them. Leave."
krg_engdip.76.b: "They'll blink. Stand firm."

krg_engdip.77.t: "The Germans Back Down"
krg_engdip.77.d: "After a moment that will go down in the history books, Britain can let out her breath. The Kaiserliche Marine signalled to the Accord forces in the English Channel that they were departing and began an orderly withdrawal.\n\nDespite it all, we've won! And we're free of that bloody treaty!"
krg_engdip.77.a: "Vive L'Accord!"

krg_engdip.78.t: "The Germans Back Down"
krg_engdip.78.d: "After a moment that will go down in the history books, Britain can let out her breath. The Kaiserliche Marine signalled to the Accord forces in the English Channel that they were departing and began an orderly withdrawal.\n\nDespite it all, we've won! And the Brits are free of that damn treaty!"
krg_engdip.78.a: "What a joyous day!"

krg_engdip.79.t: "Shots Fired in the Channel!"
krg_engdip.79.d: "The Germans have fired shots at our ships!\n\nWhat do we do? Quickly now, sir! We need an order!"
krg_engdip.79.a: "Retreat!"
krg_engdip.79.b: "Return Fire!"

krg_engdip.80.t: "Shots Fired in the Channel!"
krg_engdip.80.d: "The Accord have fired shots at our ships!\n\nWhat do we do? Quickly now, sir! We need an order!"

### Other Dip/Rearmament Tree Events ###

krg_engdip.100.t: "A Conversation about 'Victory'"
krg_engdip.100.d: "A new organisation has been created in order to promote the ideas of our rearmament as a nation among others, to have an army, a navy and an airforce worthy of the names.\n\nCalled the Defence Action Group, it brings together experts from across the political, diplomatic and industrial spheres to promote and map out defensive rearmament in the face of recurrent German belligerence and additionally to deal with the threat of both domestic and international Syndicalist Terror.\n\nIt will take time for these ideas to take root in the public consciousness, but our spin doctors will try their damndest to see this is successful."
krg_engdip.100.a: "The Best Defence..."

krg_engdip.101.t: "The Banning of German Media"
krg_engdip.101.d: "With the passage of the British Mental Protection act, the Government has now officially put a ban on films, books and other media produced by the German Empire. Now, this is largely a ceremonial ban in reality: the Union of Britain had similar bans ever since its formation in 1925, and very few citizens have begun to consume German-originated media given the language barrier and difficulty of obtaining such things.\n\nNonetheless, we will ensure that the minds of the British People remain unsullied and uncorrupted by the Kaiser's lies."
krg_engdip.101.a: "Now, about that deal with CBC..."

krg_engdip.102.t: "Vilifying the Hun"
krg_engdip.102.d: "The new media regulation laws have been implemented. In books and films, the Germans are being portrayed as the ultimate evil, a force of oppression who look to stamp out individual liberty. Additionally the German can only ever appear as the villain, and the portrayal of symapthetic 'good Germans' has been entirely forbidden.\n\nBritons must understand the existential threat to their rights that the German poses, in all ways."
krg_engdip.102.a: "Defend our Liberty. Defeat the Hun!"

krg_engdip.103.t: "Further Pacifist Parliamentary Reprisals"
krg_engdip.103.d: "It appears that we're going too far, too quickly for some people.\n\nPacifists within Parliament have strongly backlashed against our rearmament policies, proving to be a thorn in our side on upcoming bills and resisting the whip, whilst outside of Parliament there are several regular protestors by the House of Commons, some of whom have been observed staying there continuously for days at a time."
krg_engdip.103.a: "We can work around this..."

krg_engdip.200.t: "Dissolution of the Oxford Treaty"
krg_engdip.200.d: "With the outbreak of the Third Weltkrieg we are now at war with the German Empire. The Oxford Treaty which has limited our army, navy, and airforce can no longer be enforced by Germany. Mainly because the only retaliation they would have is war, and we are at war with them."
krg_engdip.200.a: "Just in time"

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_EDWARD_VIII_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 23rd, 1894\nRichmond, Surrey, United Kingdom\n§W--------------§!\nIt was on a solemn winter's day in 1936 when a younger King Edward VIII commented he was \"A King without a Kingdom.\" Dedicated to reclaiming his birthright from his coronation, Edward presided over a rapid strengthening of the exiled Entente, before spearheading their intervention into the Second Weltkrieg. The war took its toll on everyone, Edward included, but it was victorious. With the Syndicalist menace vanquished, the King is at ease, his legacy as a \"Liberator\" cemented.\n\nNever an orthodox royal, Edward has been no stranger to controversy over every facet of his reign, though he's been able to brush aside his critics at every turn. His famously scandalous marriage was eventually accepted by the people, and now he rides a wave of personal popularity. Once feared to have authoritarian leanings, Edward has proved his commitment to liberal democracy throughout his reign, though his history of political interventions has proved controversial. The King also has a strong personal dislike of the Kaiser, and it is almost certain that Anglo-German relations will continue to plummet with Edward at the helm.\n\nOutside of political squabbling, some of Edward's advisors are concerned his secretive infertility will prove costly to the Monarchy's long-term stability. With his kingdom a verifiable powder keg, at best aloof to his rule, and at worst openly hostile, the King will need to have a light touch if he's to help re-stabilise the United Kingdom."
