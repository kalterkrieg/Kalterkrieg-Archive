POLITICS_MANUEL_DOMECQ_GARCIA_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\n1859\nTobatí, Paraguay\n§W--------------§!\nWhile Admiral Manuel Domecq García claims to have been born in 1862, in Buenos Aires, but the real circumstances of his birth - and the odyssey of the intervening three years - are an open secret. The Paraguayan Manuel Domecq, having lost his parents in the early battles of the War of the Triple alliance, almost became a casualty himself, while serving as a child soldier during the battle of Acosta Ñu, aged six. After being raised as a part of his Argentine uncle's family, Domecq García opted for a career in the nascent Argentine navy, the highlight of which was playing an circumstantial role in the Russo-Japanese war trough supervising the construction of two armored cruisers that eventually played an important role in the battle of Tsushima.\n\nShortly after retiring in 1915, however, Domecq García became embroiled in politics when he founded the Liga Patriotica Argentina as a paramilitary force to counter increasing social discontent. After overseeing the League's participation in the Tragic Week of 1919 and the opening stages of Patagonian unrest, García handed over the leadership to Radical politician Manuel Carlés. The 1935 Christmas coup resulted in his return to public life as Carlés' minister of the navy, and following the fraudulent elections of 1944, his Vice-President.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone, Carlés died before the aging admiral, who became president at the age of 86. This exposed the gerontocratic nature of the League, whose exclusionary character and membership had scarcely changed since its founding. Moreover, Carlés' death deprived the government of the support provided by the conservative sections of the Radical Party, on whose behalf the former president had ruled. In view of García's own fading faculties and the ever-restless state of the army, these developments have led most to conclude that the tyranny of "the Paraguayan seaman" is bound to be put out of its misery, sooner than later."

POLITICS_ARTURO_RAWSON_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 4th, 1885\nTobatí, Paraguay\n§W--------------§!\nThe United States was far from the largest source of immigrants to Argentina, but the few sons of Columbia who made their way to the Plate produced a distinguished lineage. Such was the case of Massachusetts doctor Haman Rawson. Ranking between a Patagonian town and the odd cabinet minister in terms of importance, Dr. Haman could claim the military governorship of Paraguay as evidence of his offspring's success. For Arturo Rawson, however, life will not get much better than this.\n\nPolitically marginalized by the Patriotic League's takeover, Colonel Rawson could look forward to the ignominy of sulking at his underfunded border command for the duration of the Patagonian War. Miraculously, however, an unexpected Paraguayan declaration of war put Rawson in charge of an entire front. With the total domination of the rivers by gunboats of the Parana flotilla, Paraguayan offensives were made virtually impossible, giving Rawson ample time to receive reinforcements and launch his own invasion of Paraguay.\n\nA string of easy victories over the underequipped and exhausted Guarani army made Rawson an instant war hero, as did his triumphal entry into Asuncion only six months after the surprise attack. Nevertheless, continued resistance through the subsequent years made the Second Paraguayan War by far the bloodiest conflict of the Cone Wars, and resistance in the most remote areas of the countryside continued well into the 1940s, by which time a second demographic catastrophe had befallen Paraguay. Rawson, conqueror of Paraguay, was awarded the military governorship of the country, neutralizing the politically-ambitious war hero in a golden cage, which his proximity to retirement age made all but certain would be his last posting.\n\nWhile he attempted to circumvent his de facto exile by creating a collaborationist government - thus abolishing his own office - the ravaged state of the country made it impossible for it to exert any authority. Therefore, the Argentine 8th Cavalry Division -with Rawson at its head - is stuck with the task of administering Paraguay. Consequently, the 8th Division, and Rawson himself, have had little chance to influence the conspiracies brewing in the rest of the military." ###may be used at some point###


### Ideas ###
ARG_master_of_south_america: "The Master of the Cone"
ARG_master_of_south_america_desc: "The Southern Cone Wars of 1938-42 were a major victory for the Argentine people. Having triumphed against all enemies, the Queen of the South, Buenos Aires, now stands as the capital to which millions respond, whether they like it or not."
ARG_economic_boom: "Economic Boom"
ARG_economic_boom_desc: "Our now monopolistic control over agricultural exports in the Southern Cone, the great demand generated by European reconstruction, the ruination of American agriculture during the civil war, and our trading arrangements with the Reichspakt have created a major economic bonanza, even as our political situation deteriorates further. It seems like the country has finally recovered from the economic crisis caused by the first Weltkrieg."
ARG_mask_off: "The Mask's Off"
ARG_mask_off_desc: "Manuel Carlés was an expert liar, a brilliant manipulator, who managed to convince the army that he represented the future of nationalism, economic independence, and autarky. The truth was, however, that the Liga Patriotica would never accede to any of those programmes, and that its entire rule has been characterized by favoring the traditional rural upper classes. While this is obvious to everyone, personal trust in Carlés' seemingly convinced everyone that one day, he would really follow through on his promises.\n\nWith Carlés' passing, the thin veneer of nationalist respectability under which the League had covered itself has disappeared. It has become apparent to all that the LP, far from being the guiding light of Argentine destiny, is a closed off elite cabal, an oligarchic and paternalistic decision making body which is entirely detached from the feelings of the country and population at large, which cares more for the interest of foreing capital than its own people. With many nationalist army officers radicalized by years of Carlés' rhetoric, this realization is likely to have severe consequences."
ARG_aimless_regime: "Aimless Regime"
ARG_aimless_regime_desc: "The Liga Patriotica's rejection of politicking and parties meant that it was never going to be a mass movement. With its leadership basically unchanged since its founding by the time Carlés died, the median age for a member of the cabinet has only gone up.\n\nThe LP has been reduced to a parody of its own government, with the increasingly geriatric Admiral Domec García leading a council composed of political fossils from the late 1910s and early 1920s, with little support from the Army, increasing indifference from the navy, and contempt from provincial governors. Popular support is virtually nonexistent, and most agree the LP continues to rule out of a sense of inertia, to which the tired old men at its head are enslaved to. The question is not if it will be toppled, but when, and by whom..."
