OMA_Slavery: "Legalized Slavery"
OMA_Slavery_desc: "Across the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman the barbaric practice of slavery is legalized, and normalized amongst society... according to the Sultan at least. Despite international condemnation of slavery across the globe, the Sultanate along with the other South Arabian states have slipt by unnoticed. Although a very small amount of the population are still enslaved due to the collapse of the pearl diving industry, many still remain in chains, including thousands of personal slaves who serve the Sultan. This along with many other horrendous practices have led to the creation of a liberal resistance among the population, and have led to many foreigners thinking twice before supporting Britain's greatest ally on the Arabian peninsula."
OMA_Omani_Separatism: "Omani Separatism"
OMA_Omani_Separatism_desc: "The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman despite how it looks on a map is in fact two separate nations, the Sultanate of Muscat along the coast and the Imamate of Oman in the interior. However not all are happy with this arrangement, notably the Omani's. Led by the Imam, the Omani people resistance to the Sultan's rule has been growing, and calls for complete Omani separation have been heard. Along with the distinct identities, separatism is only expected to increase with the arrival of British oil surveyers who've been invited to Oman by the Sultan, without informing the Imam. It seems obvious at this point that with anger growing both in the Sultanate and Imamate it seems certain that tensions will boil over, and a civil war is inevitable."
OMA_Arab_Nationalism: "Pan-Arab Nationalism"
OMA_Arab_Nationalism_desc: "The Arab world shares one language, one religion, and one culture, and for many the division of the Arab world is simply unacceptable. The Pan-Arab ideology is not united one, but its goals all the same, a united world under one flag. In the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman this ideology has taken the form of the Arab Nationalist Movement, a student led pan-Arab and Arab socialist revolutionary organization. The ANM calls for complete revolution against the sultanate under the banner of a socialist vanguard party. This ideology that has been born by the ANM in Muscat has been refered to as Arab Totalism, being a combination of the Totalist ideologies of Europe and the pan-Arab ideologies of the Middle East. Although now their dream of a united Arab world seems like a far-fetched dream, across the Middle East pan-Arabs are organizing, and soon the fires of revolution may engulf the monarchies of old."
OMA_Dhofar_Rebellion: "Dhofar Rebellion"
OMA_Dhofar_Rebellion_desc: "In the Dhofar province of Muscat the Dhofar Liberation Front, a united revolutionary front made up of the Bait Kathir tribe, the Dhofar Soldiers Organization, the Dhofar Benevolent Society, and the Arab Nationalist Movement has been waging a guerilla war against the Sultanate. The Liberation Front is a broad tent coalition of revolutionary groups under the leadership of the National Liberation Council and consists of everything from Dhofari nationalists from the Bait Kathir to pan-Arab nationalists in the Arab Nationalist Movement. Although the DLF only has around 1,000 fighters it has been waging a guerilla war against military targets in Dhofar, and slowly taking over towns in the backcountry. Although now they lack power to make meaningful change at present, their power is growing, and it is only a matter of time before the small rebellion breaks out into full scale revolution."
