krg_dnf.0.t: "A Radical Reconfiguration"
krg_dnf.0.d: "Looking back, the time between 1937 and 1947 somehow seems much more than a decade.\n\nThe Bethlen government in Hungary fell in the shadow of Black Monday. With it, the obstructionist elements against the idea of federalisation, those that sought unsustainable privilege for some and penury for others simply over their nationality, were gone. Truly starting with the Ausgleich re-negotiations, Kaiser Karl led nearly three years of rapid debate, compromise and reform to selflessly modernise his empire.\n\nThe 'Rotes-Österreich' government began the Balaton Congress of 1937-1938, with all major regional governments invited to help redraw the empire. After nearly 6 weeks of continuous work, the ultimate compromise was met. Seven nations in a single state, or the \"Nationen innerhalb eines Staates Prinzip\", became the order of the day, as the ambitious Personal Principle proposal of the Renner government failed to gain a quorum. The Common Army (Gemeinsame Armee) became the singular Army of the Federation, aside from the national 'Landsturm' that would stand to protect each nation's own 'Staatsrechts' (states-rights) only when called upon. These became known as the Balaton Principles.\n\nAfter the Congress was done, the new Federal Constitution was written and later ratified in each regional diet. Day by day, progress was made towards creating a society that could, overlook or at least work past, the boundaries of nation and language, that would slowly transcend ethnic division and squabbling. And in the end on December 31st 1939, as the multitudes of Austria-Hungary toasted the New Year, they entered the new decade as Citizen-Subjects of the Danubian Federation.\n\nBut while the new Federation was forged through the power of peace and diplomacy, the storm cloud of war was gathering over Europe. The people of the Federation would not stand for their blood to be pointlessly spilt on the Kaiserreich's behalf once again, but as the Third Internationale and Russian State began to threaten the borders of the nations of Danubia, this idealistic stance of pacifism and neutrality quickly fell by the wayside..."
krg_dnf.0.a: "Indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter."
krg_dnf.0.b: "I played before, skip the film reel!"

krg_dnf.1.t: "The Fires of War"
krg_dnf.1.d: "January 4th, 1942. As the Syndicalists barrelled across the Rhine, and Russian armies marched into Ukraine, Kaiser Karl sent an ultimatum to both belligerent powers. He'd hoped that the war could be resolved peacefully, but this was an ultimatum backed by the new Federal Army. Paris's response was apoplectic, Moscow's one of pure ignorance. After one month, Kaiser Karl formally offered his armies to the beleaguered Kaiser Wilhelm III in an ironic twist on the events of 1914, and Danubia joined the Second Weltkrieg.\n\nThe Danubian war could be considered in three separate fronts:\n- The West, where the volunteer 'Donau Legionen' were joined by a proper expeditionary force, allowing Germany to stabilise a quickly collapsing frontline in the Rhineland, and slowly turn the tide of the Syndicalist onslaught.\n-The East, where Danubian troops broke the Siege of Odesa and advanced into the Ukraine, liberating much of the rump state that exists now and playing a huge part in forcing Savinkov to seek the humiliating ceasefire on the Dnieper-Daugava line.\n- Italy, where Danubia skirmished fiercely and led a number of grand offensives in the Po Valley in support of the Italian Republic against the Socialist Republic of Italy. Their successes here were sadly tarnished by a tremendously botched combined arms landing at Rimini which ultimately extended the war in Italy by several long and bloody months.\n\nHowever after five bloody years, laurels were to be heaped at Danubia's feet. The nation had intervened, blunted and reversed the Internationale and Russian advances as well as collapsed the Socialist Republic of Italy completely, saving the German Kaiser from almost certain doom. While blood and treasure had been spent abroad, it meant that not a single enemy soldier had entered the Danubian domain."
krg_dnf.1.a: "Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze!"

krg_dnf.2.t: "A Federation at Peace"
krg_dnf.2.d: "A nation under arms, a common cause united. We find ourselves in an enviable position. Whereas the other nations of Europe have been brutalised by bombing raids and nuclear weapons, Danubia has only been strengthened by it.\n\nThe triangle of the Sudetenland, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia as well as western Galicia host industrial combines like Skoda that are the envy of our war-ravaged German competitors in the Saarland. The great shipyards of Illyria stand ready to switch from military to commercial production. The military itself is relatively modern, though the inventory remains diverse, and the future holds opportunities to dictate how Danubia will fight the next war.\n\nOn the political stage, the veteran Wilhelm Miklas and his Grand Coalition have worked tremendously in upholding and disseminating our Federal values, though upcoming national elections this year could serve as an unwelcome roadblock to the Federal government if certain trends continue, especially in Illyria.\n\nNot all is well however. Kaiser Karl's famously fragile health got the better of him two years ago, with occasional scares and close runs culminating in his death wheezing and gasping in his bed as fluid filled his lungs and he succumbed to pneumonia. His heir, and the current Kaiser is the young and either idealistic, or naïve Otto, who dreams of European peace, community and understanding. A dream that may put him at odds with reality on the ground.\n\nThe Russians are still a restless threat to the east, and the uneasy subject of Germany's continued authoritarian, domineering bent, combined with their monopoly on atomic bombs, have made many politicians rather uneasy over the prospects of the new post-war world. The Danubian atomic program however, appears to be close to breaking the German monopoly, at least."
krg_dnf.2.a: "There is work to be done, Herr Miklas."

krg_dnf.3.t: "Changing of the Guard at the Federal Ministries"
krg_dnf.3.d: "The consideration of Minister-President Tildy is that we need a more visibly diverse cabinet. He can't expect the SDAPD to change their members on his whim (and anyway, they are both Hungarian and not a problem), so he has had conversations with Finance Minister Raab and Foreign Minister Figl.\n\nNeither was exactly thrilled to take a step back from the top line of politics but ultimately the Minister President's star is on the rise, and theirs can hang a little lower in the grand scheme of things for awhile. No doubt this will be the last we hear of either of them. No doubt Lois Weinberger will do well at the Finanzamt and Lujo Tončić-Sorinj will be able execute Foreign Policy. "
krg_dnf.3.a: "Danubia must forge boldly forward."

krg_dnf.4.t: "An Examination of National Obligations"
krg_dnf.4.d: "The report from the Finanzamt is in. The suspicions of the Minister President and what can be seen with ones eyes are confirmed. The question is now how to organise the redistribution of wealth across the territories of Danubia in such a way that the Federal government doesn't provoke an ouster and ignorance of central policy by the National Diets in future.\n\nTwo options present themselves. The first is that Wien simply girds its loins and goes to battle with the National Diets. There are leaders in every crownland who know we are stronger together, appealing to their sense of loyalty and fairness will have to suffice.\n The second is that we increase the Federal tax overhead across the board for every crownland, and return the funds into regional development funds. The second can leave us open to claims of playing favourites, but it is less likely to prompt open questioning at the national electoral level."
krg_dnf.4.a: "Appeal to their loyalties to Danubia."
krg_dnf.4.b: "Fund the regional development projects from a new tax."

krg_dnf.5.t: "Reaching Across the Aisle"
krg_dnf.5.d: "While there are groupings in the Federal Diet who exist purely as obstructionist elements, there are also legitimate political parties that have by electoral logic been left out of the agreement forming the government. \n\nUltimately there are reasons for them not to be involved in the government, but it doesn't hurt to both present yourself as a reasonable opponent, and perhaps steal any good policy ideas they may have.\n\nIt also allows us to show that the obstructionists are just that, and even being out of government doesn't mean that your voice as a voter is unheard."
krg_dnf.5.a: "A stroke of brilliance on our part"

krg_dnf.6.t: "Courting the FBLP"
krg_dnf.6.d: "The Grand Coalition is good, it works for us, but there are differences of opinion that cannot really be smoothed over. There are a great number of compromises that must be made to bridge the left and the right.\n\nThe Föderation der Bürgerlichen und Liberalen Parteien (Federation of Civic and Liberal Parties) (FBLP) are more than reasonable and often vote in favour of ideas brought forward by the government when the Balaton Bloc is bringing them to the table. While these do not represent an expansion of the Grand Coalition, or even plans to break the existing arrangement, it is not necessarily a bad thing to keep on friendly terms. Their differences are mostly with the SDAPD anyway."
krg_dnf.6.a: "Never hurts to have more friends"

krg_dnf.7.t: "Keeping Diplomatic Channels Open"
krg_dnf.7.d: "As the educated men of the Austrian School of Economics are wont to opine, the market determines the price of goods. Demand determines the availability of supply.\n\nDanubia is in the position to supply and fulfill demands all over the world. The Danubian Krone is convertable to gold, the Reichsmark, and through certain banks, the Accord fiat currencies.\n\nLet us not let a bit of diplomatic bluster between the Kaiser and Canada over the atomic bomb stand in the way of making some money. We can reassure the Accord that our intentions are not tightly bound to those of Germany, and that Danubia follows her own course.\n\nTo that end we are sending Ludwig Kleinwächter to Canada as a new ambassador."
krg_dnf.7.a: "The ship of state goes where it pleases. Good luck Herr Kleinwächter."

krg_dnf.8.t: "A new Danubian Ambassador"
krg_dnf.8.d: "Today the new Danubian Ambassador, Ludwig Kleinwächter presented his credentials to the Governor General.\n Normally not particularly of great consequence, he also passed a letter of accreditation that gave clear and explicit statements that while Germany and Danubia have been allied in the past, that the alliance was primarily defensive in nature. Additionally the Danubian Ambassador has the full trust of Minister-President Tildy and Kaiser Otto should any situation arise where peace may be threatened and require a channel of communication."
krg_dnf.8.a: "Interesting."

krg_dnf.9.t: "Bringing the Right together"
krg_dnf.9.d: "The three main currents in federal politics are as everyone knows, the Social Democrats, the Agrarian current and the Christian Social movement. Of all of these the only one to have reacted to the scope and scale of federal politics to it's truest full extent is the Social Democrats with the SDAPD.\nBy forming a federal party that has regional groups as opposed to regional groups forming a federal bloc they have a distinct advantage in co-ordinating their policy programme from a single point and then adapting it to local conditions.\nShamefully the Balaton Bloc is still working on the old model, of squabbling regional programmes that are then compromised into a grand program for the federal election. Often times this leads to accusations against individual leaders of going back on their promises or making unneeded concessions.\n\nThe answer is clear, and for the purpose of survival it must begin. The Right must Unite, or we will be buried by the Social Democrats, no matter what we do."
krg_dnf.9.a: "Proclaim unity in public, and begin talks behind closed doors."

krg_dnf.10.t: "Tentative steps towards a federal party"
krg_dnf.10.d: "After several long months and discreet meetings between the various regional leaders, their trusted lieutenants and the cabinets of the regional diets represented by the banner 'Balaton Bloc' we have a broad initial agreement to, at some point in the future at a public meeting, declare the intent to form a Federal level 'Donauvolkspartei'.\nThe specific details of the exact nature of how this party will work still require some further hammering out between the various interests and groups represented in big tent of the Balaton Bloc, but the agreement in principle is an important first step on the road to progress and ensures that we are taking the correct steps to ensure that we remain competitive against the SDAPD monolith."
krg_dnf.10.a: "A great start, to be sure."

krg_dnf.11.t: "Federalisation Proclamation Issued"
krg_dnf.11.d: "To those on the political inside track this is not a shock, acquisition of a suitable property in Wien to serve as a headquarters for the party alone has prompted much speculation. But today the official press release was made to quell media interest.\nThe 'Balaton Bloc' announced its dissolution and replacement, with all present ministers retaining their posts, as an officially constituted party at the Federal level under the name 'Donauvolkspartei' (DVP). The Party Chairman stated that 'Danubia requires united leadership that only a federal party can provide. No longer will faction divide the Balaton Bloc.'"
krg_dnf.11.a: "A bold new era for the right!"

krg_dnf.12.t: "Invite the Partidul National Român into the DVP"
krg_dnf.12.d: "Since the death of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and the new leadership of the PNR by Nicolae Penescu, relations between the Federal Government and the PNR have been much better. It seems like the time might be right to demonstrate that despite the historical tendency of the PNR toward seeking further self-determination, the present leadership of the PNR is in concorde with that of the federal DVP.\n\nThere is no better way to do this than by inviting the PNR into the DVP, however some are concerned that their movement has some irreconcilable differences with mainstream Danubian politics and there is no place for them in the DVP."
krg_dnf.12.a: "The differences are not as great as our commonalities. Invite them."
krg_dnf.12.b: "The differences between our programs are not bridgable. Forget it."

krg_dnf.13.t: "The Partidul National Român join the DVP"
krg_dnf.13.d: "Having received the invitation from our party to join them, the PNR have discussed and reviewed the idea. Ultimately PNR chairman Penescu agreed with our assessment that our programs will be more likely to be fulfilled if we work together as a federal organisation across the whole of Danubia, rather than squabbling on a regional scale.\n\nThe original PNR is no more, rather it is the fraction of the DVP in Transylvania."
krg_dnf.13.a: "Excellent"

krg_dnf.14.t: "The Partidul National Român reject the DVP"
krg_dnf.14.d: "Having received the invitation from our party to join them, the PNR have discussed and reviewed the idea. Ultimately PNR chairman Penescu disagreed with our assessment that our programs will be more likely to be fulfilled if we work together as a federal organisation across the whole of Danubia, rather than squabbling on a regional scale.\n\nCiting concerns about voters and party recognition, the cause of the Vlachs in Transylvania being somehow special compared to that of other minorities within the empire and protecting his flank from accusations by the Hossu faction within the PNR of being a puppet of Wien.\nUltimately it just goes to show, we cannot trust Penescu, despite our assistance to him."
krg_dnf.14.a: "Such ingratitude, does he forget who put him there?"

krg_dnf.15.t: "Strengthening the Coalition"
krg_dnf.15.d: "We have been in government with the SDAPD for years now. They were the first ones to form a federal organisation in Danubia. Their continuing success, well developed program and ability to both provide complex viewpoints and simple talking points provide us with significant competition during the election season.\n\nHowever, it is in their interest to stay in coalition with us, as we provide them a veneer of legitimacy in more rural, reactionary parts of the country. They might wish for once to be the senior partner in the coalition, but if they ask, it is thought they would not be above sharing some war stories about forming their own organisation at the Federal level, and perhaps even sharing some of the takeaway points."
krg_dnf.15.a: "There is nothing impious about a touch of humility. Ask."
krg_dnf.15.b: "Do we no longer have eyes? We can do this on our own merit."

krg_dnf.16.t: "The lessons of the SDAPD"
krg_dnf.16.d: "Unsurprisingly several key SDAPD members were, when discretely pressed, happy to share warstories from their party formation times to their colleagues and opposite numbers in various ministries. Collation of those stories brings two interesting strategies we may wish to emulate rather than going around the houses to every crownland's Conservative party and beg their assistance.\n\nWhile we know that the real significant ethnic groups are still the Austrians and Hungarians from the simple amassed wealth and the number of them among the nobility, one SDAPD tactic we could consider is to get those two parties into a direct consensus and then use that as the basis of any platform.\n The second tactic to target the smaller, less populous and wealthy crownlands to make strategic concessions for the greater whole. Obviously this will require some wrangling, but by dealing with them en bloc instead of individually, we could save some time."
krg_dnf.16.a: "Well, we can consider playing politics if it becomes expedient."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.1.t: "Upcoming Elections in Austria"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.1.d: "It is Election Season in the Archduchy of Austria. Since the 1920s, the nation's politics have been highly polarised, sliding into a defacto two-party system between the Socialists and the Christian Democrats. The ruling party in Austria has routinely switched throughout the years, and elections are always highly competitive and contentious. \n\nNow, both sides have activated their vast political machines, hoping to convince the swathes of swing voters to back them once more in the National Diet."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.1.a: "We will help support the Reither's campaign for the National Diet."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.1.b: "There are more pressing issues to attend to, Reither will have to make do."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.2.t: "The SDAPD holds onto Austria"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.2.d: "Austria remains red as the SDAPD wins the national diet with [?DNF_austria_socialist_pop]% of the vote. Theodor Körner will remain in charge of the National Diet for the next four years, and with the war over he promises a new wave of social and economic reforms."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.2.a: "The Age of Red Austria continues."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.3.t: "The [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] Wins in Austria"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.3.d: "Austria goes black as the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] wins the national diet with [?DNF_austria_conservative_pop]% of the vote. Josef Reither will now lead the National Diet for the next four years, promising to bring order and prosperity to the upstanding citizens of our Nation."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.3.a: "Lets hope old man Reither doesn't let us down."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.4.t: "Karl Renner Speaks in Wien"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.4.d: "Vice-Minister-President Karl Renner speaks in support of Körner's administration, and the elder statesman's words swayed a lot of minds. His elegant oration has proven once again to foil the plans of the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] in Austria."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.4.a: "Damn that old man, we'll have to try harder."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.5.t: "De Gasperi Campaigns in Tyrol"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.5.d: "Speaker of the Federal Parliament Alcide de Gasperi has concluded a series of speeches across his native Tyrol. Speaking in both Italian and German, de Gasperi has helped us consolidate our voting base in the region, as he called out lackluster investment by the national government."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.5.a: "Good to see we have the Italian vote covered!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.6.t: "Austrian Smear Campaigns Go Further"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.6.d: "The [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] used Anti-Semitism in its campaign material in order to remind the fine burghers of Austria to be wary of those cosmopolitan drifters who coalesce in their great cities. It is an old and increasingly controversial tactic, but it is still somewhat effective. For how long however, nobody knows. It might be wise to stop sooner rather than later with this particular tactic, if only to avoid being associated with increasingly crackpot organisations on the right-wing fringe."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.6.a: "A most unsavoury campaigning tactic indeed..."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.7.t: "Socialist Campaigns Succeed"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.7.d: "SDAPD/Ö campaigners have been out in force, and successfully appealed to the hearts and minds of people across Austria.\n\nThe policies enacted in Vienna, their care taken toward workers and farmers, and their vision for the future apparently appealed more than ours."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.7.a: "Darn, we should have challenged them more!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.8.t: "Archduke Robert Weighs In"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.8.d: "Archduke Robert of Austria-Este speaks to the people of Austria! ... And fails miserably. In fact he has successfully turned people away from the CSP to the other conservative parties, splintering our voting base in disillusionment. The SDAPD/Ö is surely going to benefit from this blunder."

His loss will be keenly felt among the stalwarts of the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] for whom he had provided leadership for many years. He has been replaced as leader of the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] by his deputy Heinrich Gleissner."

Theodor Körner's SDAPD/Ö will face a fresh contender in the form of Heinrich Gleissner. The CSP however are ready to proceed with their old tricks, even if the game has changed slightly. Tensions rise as political discourse start to increase in dominance in venues in a range diverse from Tyrolese chalets to the ever busy coffeehouses of proud Wien.\n\n The old Black vs Red checker game looks set to be played out once more."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.11.d: "Theodor Körner proves that his age does not impair his leadership, nor the adeptness with which he plays the political machine that is the SDAPD/Ö. \n\nA veteran of more elections than he cares to count, Körner has once more eked out the votes that allow many of the SDAPD/Ö to return to their seats in the Austrian Diet. On this specific occasion he has also claimed a few more new seats and allowed them to form the new national government to lead Austria further into this atomic age."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.12.d: "Herr Gleissner can now burnish his credentials, having won his first contested election and against such an opponent as the venerable Theodor Körner to boot.\n\nWhile things looked close at times, the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] managed to eke out a margin and then build on their successes from there. As new [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty] members of the Austrian Diet take up their seats in the parliament, they will be joined by colleagues with more experience. \n\nAcross the aisle from them, Herr Körner will be keeping them on their toes, should they slip up."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.15.d: "The [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty]'s previous lack of interest in the Tyrolese region has come back to hurt us. Whilst we mobilised many people to go out and vote, they appear to be promising their affiliations to the SDAPD/Ö.\n\nKörner and his confederates must be rubbing their hands together with glee at our failure to bring the vote home, given that they have barely invested energy in the region during this electoral cycle!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_austria.15.a: "A crushing blow to the [DNF_AustrianBalatonParty]'s prospects"

Without this alliance, the Socialists would be running Bohemia. It would be in our interests to prop up the Coalition, there's a good chance that the Socialists might win this year."

The stages in Prague, Brno, Ostrava and elsewhere are being thrown together and the cities are being festooned with color for the election season. Unlike the tense showdown in Austria earlier this year, the occasion is not expected to be particularly tempestuous. The faces of the party leaders are familiar, the policies known and while the anti-democratic and anti-Imperial fringe have made their usual statements about attempting a boycott of the polls, there is no true concern a majority of people will listen to the call.\n\nLife is good for the majority of people in Bohemia, with matters mostly calm in the humming industrial heartland of the Federation. The election period looks set to reflect that."

They have seized several lecture theatres but the administrative offices have not been disturbed.\n\nThe timing could be better, but often these manifestations coincide with the regional elections in order to draw Federal involvement in internal matters.\n\nGiven the status of Bohemia within the Federation, and Czechs within Bohemia, as well as their comparative wealth their demands have rang a little hollow to say the least, both within and outside of Prague."

Josip Broz has taken charge of the National Diet for the next four years, and he has promised a new and expansive wave of reforms for the region. Broz's career thus far has made some waves in the SDAPD at the federal level, and it seems that his continued ascent to the highest halls of power will not be stopped here."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.2.d: "Illyria has since the last national election been held in a coalition between the Croatian Peoples' Peasant Party (HPSS), with the Croatian Christian Democratic Party (HKSS). A fractuous coalition, both parties seek to push out their partners, whilst also excluding the Socialists from government. They have an uphill struggle however, as both organisations have limited appeal in an increasingly broad electorate. Without our direct involvement, there is no chance that they'll stop the Socialists from sweeping to power in the Crownland. If we do get involved, it may be the start of a Sisphyean struggle to keep their electoral prospects alive. "

A counter protest at the rally by a group of youths from the Savez Socijalističke Omladine Ilirija (SSOI), the Socialist Youth League of Illyria, was set upon by those who had attended the rally.\n\nIllyria is unfortunately beset by widespread unemployment, which means that there are many people who are sympathetic to the Socialists program, and HKSS partisans roughing up protestors doesn't help matters either."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.5.d: "In hindsight, the only surprise about the victory won by Josip Broz in 1948 was the scale of the margin he achieved. The veteran of many political battles in the region was able to take advantage of the dissent between the coalition parties and took the SDAPD/I to such a degree of success that many wonder how he will achieve a repeat. \n\nBut the man's personal popularity, 'Tito' as he is commonly known and referred to in Illyria, comes from keeping his promises and extending a hand to everyone in the region.The nickname comes from his time working for the SDAPD/I and his long service in the party since the 1922 Zagreb Waiter's Strike after his return from Russia after the first Weltkrieg. \n\nIn the last four years since his electoral victory, he's wasted no time in turning Illyria into a bastion of SDAPD power, with construction of infrastructure, ports and factories funded in part by the Federal Treasury and his public disdain for the Von Mises Commission's stringent requirements is well known.\nSome in Wien even whisper he might be doing too much, too quickly in his transformation of the region."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.8.t: "Operation Rug-Pull"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.8.d: "While we are all one party here in the SDAPD, the way the Josip Broz conducts himself in Illyria is sometimes akin to the Habsburgs back in the old days, making a point to attend the birth of the ninth offspring in peasant families, for example.\n\nThere is some concern that Broz thinks that he is the future of the party and that his brand of Social Democracy is the natural progression of our policy. While he may be correct in the former, there are those who disagree with the speed at which he's pushing to make that change, and dislike the cavalier attitude he runs Illyria with."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.8.a: "We should take him down a peg."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.9.d: "The Broz government has overseen not just a push towards employment and development in the region but also provided a great deal of social support that was previously missing. Now the election is afoot, it might be helpful if the Federal government could co-opt this social drive by providing models for alternative organisations.\n\nThe issue is not that Broz has necessarily come up with the best solution to the problems in Illyria, but rather he's thrown the weight of the government behind them. If we want a friendly government in Zagreb, we will need to provide evidence that the opposition will also work to solve the problems before them, with more alacrity than previously."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.9.a: "Let's demonstrate our resolve."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.9.b: "The damage is already done."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.10.t: "Importing the Landbunds"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.10.d: "A great deal of the Illyrian crownland is still rural and the implementation of the policy by Broz's government has bracketed the peasant off to the side as a producer who works only on their own labour and either sells their goods or time. Essentially they treat the peasant's personal goals as generally in alignment with the working class.\n\nWe propose that by exporting the Landbund concept from Austria and creating associations of peasants and farmers we can deepen the combined means of these groups and allow them to actualise their own political agendas (which we believe will align more closely with our own than those of urbanites). By strengthening the peasant class we can also develop the region's agricultural capacities as the Federal population continues to expand."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.10.a: "A solid plan. Do it."

The dockyards and ports of Illyria will grow in importance as time goes by and the industrial output of the empire continues to grow, supporting the communities there by forming associations for the workers with state backing is a matter of Federal importance.\n\nThe foundation of a Longshoremen's Association will allow the state to both maintain good relations with these key workers. Additionally, it will ensure that the state does not get outflanked by Syndicalist agitators, provide funds to care for those who might be left behind by workplace accidents, and improve working conditions without impacting efficiency."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_illyria.12.d: "The railworkers of Danubia are from all over the country, however the spirit of decentralisation might behoove their headquarters to be based elsewhere than Wien. There is also the small fact that a great number of young Illyrian men, until recently, fled the endemic unemployment of the crownland by becoming railworkers. By sponsoring the construction of a office for the official representatives of the Federal Railworkers in Zagreb, we send a clear message that we respect their efforts and that once again Danubia is more than just a coterie of politicians in Wien.\n\nThe imposing edifice will stand over downtown Zagreb, allowing the railwaymen a great view of the city, as well as being situated near to the Glavni kolodvor on Trg Kralja Tomislav, named after the historical first king of Croatia. All they need a bit of assistance to get the plans off paper and into reality."

And on the first occasion since Broz's previous electoral success, it seems we may have upset him by being so transparent in our distrust that he has achieved those numbers fairly.\n\nFrom what the observers reported, the elections are passing without incident and the enthusiasm given by the voters appears to be legitimate. The votes don't lie... and neither has Tito. In response he's sworn that Minister President Schärf will be out of office before he co-operates with Vienna on top level issues again."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.1.t: "Upcoming Elections in Galicia"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.1.d: "Galicia is somewhat unique amongst the crownlands - the SDAPD has really struggled to gain a foothold here.\n\nThe main parties here all caucus at a federal level. They are the Liberal Caucus - who work closely with the oil industry and do well in the cities of Lwow (Lemburg) and Stanislawow consequently, the BDP Caucus who are rather prominent in the west, having headquarters in Krakow and the CSP Caucus which has broad support in the countryside amongst those who bother to vote. Smouldering Polish and Ukrainian nationalism means the area also has a significantly lower than average voter turnout in general, as people still hove to national organisations and dismiss the actual politics happening around them.\n\nThis has the side effect of making the race in the Crownland reasonably close most years, with the Liberal Caucus having only held office since 1945 after breaking their coalition with the BDP Caucus to go into government alone. This means that pretty much every party is looking to try and claim an outright majority. With our support, the CSP Caucus could mobilise voters across the crownland and bring the Galician Diet into agreement with the federal government."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.1.a: "Let's win it for the CSP Caucus"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.1.b: "We can't expend our efforts on this backwater."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.2.t: "The Liberal Caucus win."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.2.d: "After a close fought battle, the inertia of the Liberal Caucus was too high for the efforts of our colleagues in the CSP Caucus to overcome despite our best efforts. The Liberal Caucus have returned to power for the next four years in Galicia and we do not predict much significant change to come in the crownland due to their policy of letting the market (read, their sponsors in big oil) determine conditions in the crownland.\n\nPolakiewicz is claiming this is a vindication of his politics and attributes his economic policy to the ideas of the Austrian School Economists, in spite of some Federal interventions in the region over the years. Unfortunately his success will likely lead him to continue his policy of claiming the success of Federal initiatives as his own, and blaming the failure of his own policies on Wien."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.2.a: "A shame, let's hope Polakiewicz might be more agreeable in future."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.3.t: "The BDP Caucus win"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.3.d: "Despite our best efforts the Social Liberals from Krakow managed to appeal to a broad enough base in the cities that they managed to turn the heads of the normally stolidly uninterested Polish człowiek. At least enough to vote this time. The fluid nature of politics in the region is predicated on the lack of change, and while they are committed on paper to more socially liberal concensus and policy than their predecessors, there is a strong likelihood that Chądzyński's movement will not gather much steam once they start treading on the toes of the socially conservative parts of society.\n\nThe good news is that Chądzyński will at least be open to negotiation on Federal intervention, and might be persuaded to vote with the Federal government at the national level."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.3.a: "Could have been better, but perhaps we're going to be fine."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.4.t: "Victory for the CSP Caucus in Galicia!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.4.d: "With a bold policy offering and a hard-fought election, the CSP with help from it's federal backers has managed to propel itself into the government of the Galician crownland. Party chief Adam Romer has taken on the mantle of Minister-President for the crownland and we will be able to co-ordinate with the Galician government in affairs in the region without any undue issue or concern.\n\nThe Galician crownland is one of the more socially conservative parts of the country, aside from the cities, and it will do them good to have a government which reflects the average voter's life. With our support, the CSP caucus will be able to tackle the ongoing poverty in the region, and help develop it to a higher standard while not offending the sensibilities of the average citizen."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.4.a: "Great success!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.5.t: "Mobilise the Countryside."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.5.d: "The Christian Social Party caucus has its roots in the agrarian life of the Galician hinterland that has in some ways not changed in centuries. Whilst modernity is inevitable, the people here are strongly attached to their culture. Showing sensitivity toward their cultural heritage, and painting one of the other caucuses, with their city support bases, as a cosmopolitan threat is simple. \n\nThe only question is, who should we finger as the cause of all their woes?"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.16.d: "The dust has settled, the streets have been swept and cleared of hooligans and looters. The city centre lies damaged, the renaissance era Cloth Hall with a shattered facade and masonry still litters the smaller streets. The Federation is shocked by the violence on display by the rioters and the suppression by the police as they deployed rubber bullets, water cannons and mounted charges to disperse the crowd, along with mass arrests.\n\nThe damage done to Krakow, and the scope of this riot speaks to the dogged antipathy that the nationalists hold towards Danubia. Now however, the streets are no longer theirs. Kaiser Otto himself came to visit the city and review the damage, and Minister-President [DNF_Federal_MP_Surname] was also in attendence at the official memorial service, after the procession and a brief mass administered by the parish priest of St. Florian, Karol Wojtyła. He was forced to step in as the Apostolic Administrator of Krakow and Archbishop of Lwow, Eugeniusz Baziak, was gravely injured during the riots protecting the Wawel Cathedral.\n\nAfter the mass, Kaiser Otto delivered a speech emphasising the many faceted strands of the Federation and how together the peoples were stronger than they were separate..."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_galicia.17.d: "Recently in Galicia, Polish Nationalist Rioters stormed the city of Krakow, fighting in the streets and requiring suppression by riot police armed with water cannon, mounted charges and rubber bullets. After the dust cleared, the Kaiser himself, along with Minister President [DNF_Federal_MP_Surname] attended the city, and took part in a memorial there for those who had lost their lives in the unrest.\n\nGalicians, Rusyns, Illyrians, Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Magyars, practically all members of the Danubian Federation heard the subsequent Speech, either on TV or on Radio. If they didn't hear it, they certainly read about it in the newspapers.\n\nOnce again Kaiser Otto has underlined his dedication to peace for the many peoples of Danubia, for those of Europe, and of the world. The response, not of repression or anger but of a measured appeal to something greater than any individual or ethnicity seems to have struck a chord - even internationally.\n\nSomething extraordinary is happening in Eastern Europe along the mighty Danube."

## Slovakian Elections 49 ###

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.1.t: "Upcoming Elections in Slovakia"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.1.d: "Slovakia, a mountainous land, where the soil is poor for agriculture and what little good farmland there is, is concentrated in the valleys. The poor agricultural prospects are rewarded by an astounding array of natural minerals and raw materials including coal, bauxite and chromium in decent quantities.\n\nThe vote is split pretty much three ways at the national level, aside from a few minority and nationalist movements which usually abstain from voting. There is the Slovenská Kresťanská Strana (SKS) who are in alignment with the CSP-OKgFP at a federal level. Their leader, Štefan Tiso has a cousin who is an important priest, and their politics are more toward the Dollfuß wing of the CSP-OKgFP than the Federalist wing. The SKS has been in government since the mid thirties and has actually toned down it's politics since the autonomy for Slovakia within the Staatsrechts framework came about. They are strongest in the Trenčín and Banská Bystrica area to the west and north of the country.\n\nOpposing them are the SDAPD/S - who have sprung up in the busy mines and industrial towns of the mountains though they also do well in the working class slums of Bratislava. They mobilise their usual urban, working-class slice of the voting pie. Then there is the interesting group - the Slovenská Národne Rolnícka Strana (SNRS) who are led by Jozef Lettrich. The party claim to represent Slovak national opinion and while being open to working at the federal level, state they will put Slovak interests first."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.1.a: "The SKS will have our support."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.1.b: "The SKS has it under control."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.2.t: "The SKS win in Slovakia!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.2.d: "Having weathered the storm of the miners' strike and made a good campaign in spite of the worker's action sucking a lot of oxygen out of the news reportage of the campaign, the SKS has been returned to government with [?DNF_slovakia_soccon_pop] of the vote. Party leader Štefan Tiso returned to the Hrad in Bratislava with a cortege of his supporters and announced he would begin naming ministers to their positions immediately."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.2.a: "Excellent, good to keep them with us."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.3.t: "The SNRS win in Slovakia!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.3.d: "Having made great political gains from the miners' strike and made a good campaign due to the worker's action sucking a lot of oxygen out of the news reportage of the campaign, the SNRS has entered into to government with [?DNF_slovakia_soclib_pop] of the vote. Party leader Jozef Lettrich led a large group of celebrating intellectuals to the Hrad in Bratislava where he took a platform and announced he would begin work on making Slovakia a Great Nation within Danubia, with promises of jobs and appeals for Federal aid in making this possible."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.3.a: "We will see, if he remains agreeable when Slovak interests might be on the line."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.4.d: "Having made great political gains from the miners' strike and made a good campaign due to the worker's action sucking a lot of oxygen out of the news reportage of the campaign, the SDAPD/S has entered into to government with [?DNF_slovakia_socdem_pop] of the vote. Party leader Ivan Dérer led a large group of celebrating workers to the Hrad in Bratislava where he took a platform and announced he would begin work on bringing Slovakia's wealth to comparable levels to that of other Danubian crownlands, with further industrialisation projects and promises of jobs for all."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.5.t: "Smearing the SDAPD/S"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.5.d: "It is very easy to smear the SDAPD as a bunch of rootless cosmopolitans who do not have any true affiliation to Slovakia but are rather the lackeys of their federal leadership in Wien. Their support base is predominantly in Bratislava amongst the working classes there, and is sufficient that the city has elected several SDAPD mayors over the years, however the rest of the country have quite the dismissive attitude to the capital. Aside from the usual city vs country rivalry, the accent of the Bratislavans is also regarded as 'sing-songy' and 'weird', so the smear campaign can play on that by having exaggerated words that are immediately picked up on as 'Bratislavan' by others, and this can be used as a short-hand for dangerous socialist.\nThe only downside is that the SNRS also benefits from such propaganda."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.5.a: "Lackeys!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.6.t: "Coal Miners go on strike!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.6.d: "The Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza AG, reports that the miners at their Handlová mine have refused to go to work and are on strike. Their strike appears to be somewhat politically motivated given the timing of the downing of tools coincides with the election season. Handlová is a small town in the Trenčín district in the north-west of the country, and it is slightly embarrassing for the SKS that this is going on in their backyard. However there are two options in dealing with the strike as there always are.\nOne opportunity is to support the strikers and their demands, and try and guide the company management to a compromise. \nThe second is to dismiss the strikers and their demands, then send in the police if they do not return to work peacefully."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.6.a: "Support the strike. Their demands are valid."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.6.b: "Crush the strike. Their demands are nonsense."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.7.t: "The Strike grows in strength."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.7.d: "The Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza AG, reports that the miners at their Handlová mine have continued to refuse to go to work and are on strike. Worse yet, their other facilities have also gone on strike and the strikers are now also active in Banska Stiavnica and Banska Bystrica. The entirety of Western Slovakia is threatening to down tools. Fortunately the government is supporting the mine company in this negotiation phase and they are making good progress. There is a decent chance the strike will be resolved with a bit of state assistance.\n\nThe SNRS came out in opposition to the strike early on and it is hurting them somewhat that they are now seen as less conciliatory than the government and the SDAPD."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.7.a: "We will just have to cross our fingers."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.8.t: "The Strike is crushed!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.8.d: "After bringing in extra policemen from Bratislava and Presov, the miners lines at the Handlová mine were stormed by horseback mounted police followed by the main body of policemen on foot in several baton charges. Some of the miners had rifles and fired back, which caused the police to open fire with their service pistols in return. At the end of it, the strikers dispersed from the mine and though several were wounded, fortunately nobody died in the disturbance. The other strikers have returned to work after this, and word is that planned strikes in Banska Bystrica and Banska Stiavnica in support have been cancelled. \n\nThe government is being praised for a strong response in certain circles."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.8.a: "Perhaps they will learn."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.9.t: "The Strike Negotiations Succeed!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.9.d: "The team from the government managed to co-ordinate with the mining company in order to make a great deal of progress in the negotiations. The matter of back-pay and working conditions were the primary driver for the strike, and changing these was not outside the remit of the agenda given to the negotiation team. The strike leaders said they were aware of Federal assistance in the election, and wanted to make sure the SKS was put in the spotlight by their action.\n\nUltimately concerns that this strike represented a nationalist or syndicalist current in the Slovak mines were unfounded and the issue was resolved peacefully. The workers at mines across Western Slovakia have returned to work."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.9.a: "Cunning!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.10.t: "The SDAPD/S rally in support of the wounded miners"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.10.d: "The SDAPD/S have been using the events of the crushing of the strike to great effect in mobilising votes against the SKS and SNRS as anti-slovak, anti-worker political parties that do not represent the interests of the common Slovak person. It's blatant propaganda but it has an unfortunate note of truth due to the heavyhanded dealing with the strike."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.10.a: "Gah, they're making political capital out of this."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.11.t: "The Slovak Election of 1953"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.11.d: "From the Danube in the west to the mountains that run along the length of the crownland, the time has come again for Slovakia to prepare for elections. All parties are acutely aware of a tide of dissatisfaction that seems to be sweeping the country, about their relative place between the other crownlands and the blood spilt by Slovaks during the war. The memory of the Slovak miners' strike that fell on the 1949 election is still fresh in political memory too.\n\n While spirits are high, things are tense. Developments across the federation are sure to make this election a crucial one. "
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.11.a: "It's important we show up for this one."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.11.b: "The affairs of the crownland are just that. Their own."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.12.d: "The votes are in, the ballots counted. The Veteran's movement storm has been weathered and the [DNF_Slovak_Balaton_Party] have emerged with the mandate to lead the crownland.\n\nŠtefan Tiso has proven his political chops once again."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.12.a: "Whew, these elections are getting intense."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.13.t: "SNRS triumph at the polls in Slovakia" 
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.13.d: "The votes are in, the ballots counted. The Veteran's movement storm has been weathered and the SNRS have emerged with the mandate to lead the crownland.\n\nNo doubt Jozef Lettrich will go to great lengths to take that mandate as far as he can, in the interest of the Slovak people."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.13.a: "Interesting times in Slovakia"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.14.t: "The SDAPD/S triumph at the polls in Slovakia"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.14.d: "The votes are in, the ballots counted. The Veteran's movement storm has been weathered and the SDAPD/S have emerged with the mandate to lead the crownland.\n\nThe venerable Ivan Dérer has lead his party to success once more, and gave a strong speech to celebrate his victory, reminding all that the Austro-Marxist imperative of the SDAPD must be fulfilled and that social democracy will improve the lives of all Slovaks."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.14.a: "What a firebrand!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.15.t: "Veteran's Uprising in Slovakia!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.15.d: "Seeing the miners strike last election and witnessing the tensions in Galicia during the earlier round of elections, Slovak Veterans of the First and Second Weltkrieg's as well as some former members of the Czechoslovak Legions have assembled en masse in Bratislava to demonstrate for better pensions and health benefits.\n\nThey state that they helped fight for this nation and yet they recieve less in veteran's pay than their compatriots in other crownlands. Particularly they point to the pay discrepencies between Slovakia and the funds veterans recieve in Austria and Bohemia.\n\nTheir demands seem mostly reasonable, though some Legionnaires are brandishing arms and trying to remind the veterans that they fought for a country who did not care for them all that much, and it would be in their interests to make a real uprising of it.\n\nThey are being mostly told to keep their mouths shut, for now."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.15.a: "No doubt we will be receiving a communique from Bratislava soon."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.16.t: "How to handle the Veterans?"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.16.d: "The government in Bratislava officially requested the aid of the Federal Government, stating that Crownland coffers afforded a generous pension to all veterans who required it, as related to the standard of living inside the Crownland.\n\nSeveral members of the Federal government have stated that it would provide an opportunity to centralise the loyalty of former members of the armed forces. Others have stated that the matter should be handled by Federal coffers in principle because the army is now a Federal service.\n\nUltimately the response of the crownland government is a perfectly legitimate one, but to ignore this opportunity to resolve the question and remove some intra-national differences seems foolish."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.16.a: "Arrange a meeting, invite the leaders to Vienna."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.16.b: "Suppress the Veterans, this is just ungrateful."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.17.t: "Veterans arrive in Vienna"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.17.d: "The Veterans managed to put together something resemble a leadership, with several high ranking soldiers from the Gemeinsame Armee and other branches of the service represented. They did however also send a former Czechoslovak Legionnaire as well.\n\nThe idea of a Federal Veteran's Affairs Office went down well, and the idea that the federal government would level pay across the crownlands was also welcomed.\n\nThe only sticking point was if the former turn-coats of the Legion deserved any part of this."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.17.a: "Danubia looks after her own. Only her own."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.17.b: "Those turncoats still have a vote!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.18.t: "Blood on the Streets of Bratislava!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_slovakia.18.d: "When the cordite cleared it was obvious that the mass rally hadn't really been prepared to be stormed. They perhaps believed the propaganda the federal government has spread about their commitment to Veterans.\n\nThe regional police, who are developing a bit of a reputation now, broke the rally with horse charges, kettling, shots fired into the air and tear gas. Several baton charges finally pushed a rump of former Legionnaires out of their positions.\n\nEven after all that, it seems that the status quo in Slovakia will now again be tinged with an undercurrent of seething resentment. While the elections will be able to be completed without issue, the question of 'Are we better off out than in?' is back on the people's lips. The genie is once more out of the bottle."

## Transylvanian Elections 50 ##

krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.1.t: "The death of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.1.d: "Transylvania, a mountainous and forested land, which has our restless Vlach minority as well as a vocal German and Hungarian minority within it's borders. The Vlachs have had the population plurality for some time and generally they all vote for the Partidul National Român (PNR) of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, which is rendered Transylvanian politics in essence a one party state at the national level. Indeed the events of the election are expected to be a PNR victory despite the loss of their leader, since they are due to take place next month.\n\nHowever the death of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod leaves us with an opportunity to try and arrange who replaces him. There seem to be three candidates in the running.\n - Ion Nistor, who has taken the interim chairmanship. He would continue Vaida-Voevod's policy of obstructionism when it suits him, but he would not represent a radical change in course.\n - The next candidate, who seems ideal for our purposes as an ally, is Nicolae Penescu. Any intervention we make would naturally be in support of him and his leadership of the PNR would allow for a closer political relationship at the Federal level.\n - Finally we have our worst nightmare - Iuliu Hossu. The politically active bishop of Cluj, he has spoken publically about reunifying Transylvania into a 'Greater Romania' and his chairmanship of the PNR would raise nationalist tensions in the crownland as well as invite further interference by Romania in the region's politics. We would be well served not to let him anywhere near the reins of power."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.1.a: "We better make sure Hossu doesn't get the chance."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.2.t: "Penescu wins the PNR leadership"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.2.d: "Through a combination of skilled manipulation, honest appeals and a dose of skullduggery, Nicolae Penescu has been able to leverage his involvement with the federal government into a victory in Transylvania, first in the PNR chairmanship elections and then in the regional elections. We can rest easy that the PNR will work with the Federal government going forward, rather than against it."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.2.a: "Great news."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.3.t: "Hossu wins the PNR leadership!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.3.d: "Whether it was the incompetence of his opponents or the strength of his message, Iuliu Hossu has managed to prevail in the PNR leadership election. This represents a setback for the federal government in the region, as the PNR swept to victory with renewed vigour after Hossu campaigned in the region behind the PNR. No doubt we will have to keep an eye on Carol of Romania as he will see this as an opportunity to twist our arm."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.3.a: "Drat and damn!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.4.t: "Nistor wins the PNR leadership!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.4.d: "Ultimately for all our finagling and all of Hossu's hot air, Ion Nistor was able to quietly convince those within the PNR that neither man was suited for the reins of power and that he would be best to continue his chairmanship in a non-interim capacity. This represents business as usual for the government with the PNR in Transylvania, and we will have to provide an array of suitable sticks and carrots when we need Nistor's PNR to give us votes at the federal level."

The factionalism in the region means we maybe forced to pay greater attention to Transylvanian politics in future, as the monolithic Vlach voting bloc has broken. The press have started referring to the party as the PNR-H - to signify Hossu's leadership of the fraction."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_transylvania.7.d: "Nobody is sure why Penescu got it into his head to speak politically at the funeral when it was his chance to talk. Perhaps it was meant to be a reminscence of his time as a colleague of Vaida-Voevod after he left Romania and was welcomed into the PNR by Vaida-Voevod, perhaps he thought he was layering his obvious positioning of himself as the rightful heir in enough metaphors that nobody would notice. Either way, he probably hurt his chances somewhat. These things are taken very seriously and it was considered rather distasteful by those in attendance. Worse yet, after the funeral had concluded, they communicated that distaste to their colleagues in other parts of Transylvania.\n\nThis may hurt Penescu's chances fatally."

Given his politics and the opposed position to that of the Federal government, this has had the desired effect of sowing discord amongst his partisans and dissuading some who were thinking to lend their ballots to his cause rather than another one."

This is a blow to the program of the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty], that once again we cannot win one of the most populous crownlands and worse that we have lost it again to a regionalist party. We are fortunate that they are at least pro-Federalist in general policy, even if they often find themselves at odds on specifics of legislation.\n\nThe hot summer definitely contributed to their victory, as it led to the yellow press spinning phrases out of context and blowing up the chances of the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty]."

The crownland is sweltering, tempers are rising and there is only so much cold beer to go around. And after awhile, cold beer doesn't cool tempers, it provokes them. Already several politically motivated brawls have broken out in Budapest between [HungarianOppositionParty] activists and NMP voters.\n\nThe NMP government is just as paralyzed by the heat as the rest of the country, and even the loyal stalwarts of the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] are reporting difficulty in remaining motivated when canvassing in such sticky, uncomfortable heat. The temperature looks set to remain steady for at least a few more days, and there is some debate amongst the regional party as to the next steps. \n\nDo they wait until the heatwave breaks and risk the other parties stealing a march on them?

Dramatic collapses of otherwise healthy young people, suffering from sunstroke whilst campaigning for a political party has drawn the attention of the yellow press.\n\nAlready the political pages are littered with cartoons and there are editorials about the situation. Whilst the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] has not been accused of outright cruelty, there are questions being asked about the way the party is using those who are willing to volunteer their time to it's cause. There must be some reaction. We can either continue with business as usual, or we can take special care until this heat wave breaks."

The question is not that we campaign, obviously, but rather the intensity of our campaign. We have the choice to throw all our energies into it to try and make up lost ground, or we can hope our opponents are exhausted from their travails in the heat and will want time to rest."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.7.a: "Hit the campaign trail with a vengeance."

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.8.t: "The Yellow Press Sabotage Us!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.8.d: "The lack of empathy shown for our own political agents has led the [HungarianOppositionParty] to make a great deal of political capital from our callousness. Their crummy little presses and various newspapers are slandering the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty]'s 'merciless thirst for victory' in the election and painting the [HungarianOppositionParty] (whose agents have not been exactly idle) as the sort of party that would never countenance such a thing.\n\nThe fact it was being sold on every street corner in this heat until the storm broke the heatwave yesterday and apparently been washed that fact out of everyone's minds\n\nThis is not necessarily the end of the campaign, but we've hurt ourselves here by being so zealous."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.8.a: "They just don't understand how important this is!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.9.t: "The Yellow Press Sympathise With Us!"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.9.d: "The empathy shown for our political agents hurt our political opponents. We have struck the right balance between being careful and generous to our own people, whilst also showing resolve to fight in this heat. Instead the yellow press have turned on the NMP, whose political agents have been scarcely seen despite there being an election on, Rassay's people either afraid of the heat or simply unwilling to work in it. The [HungarianOppositionParty] has made a decent slander of it and various newspapers are using their phrase, branding the NMP as the 'National Party of Shirk' rather than their official title of 'National Party of Work'.\n\nThis is not necessarily the end of the campaign, but we've managed to capture the media attention in our favour."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.9.a: "Excellent!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.10.t: "The [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] Seizes the Initiative"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.10.d: "Our hard work on the campaign trail with our fresh faced and well motivated activists has repaid dividends. We barely saw the other parties canvassing, and our strategy of waiting for the storm to break the heatwave appears to have given us the edge we needed to seize the initiative in this election. The conversation on the doorstep is reportedly around the talking points that the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] has brought up, and we've managed to make sure our program is widely known across the country.\n\nThe other parties will be smarting, as the events of our campaign are now taking up the newspapers, with generally positive editorial coverage, even grudgingly in the case of some opposition publications.\n\nThis is not necessarily the end of the campaign, but we've managed to capture the media attention in our favour."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.10.a: "Excellent!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.11.t: "The [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] Loses the Initiative"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.11.d: "Our lack of work on the campaign trail has embarrassed us as a party. How can we talk about the need for men to work as their duty when we show such a poor work ethic of our own?\n\nThe [HungarianOppositionParty] and NMP have both made strong political gains on us due to our inactivity, since they campaigned in the heat and then had a lull before getting back to it. Most people we speak to already have ideas from one of the other two party programs in mind and we're on the back foot having to repudiate their positions instead of pushing our own.\n\nSome wag in the yellow press has even dubbed the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] the 'National Party of Shirk' as a counterpoint to the NMP's 'National Party of Work' name.\n\nThis is not necessarily the end of the campaign, but we've hurt ourselves here by being so careful."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.11.a: "Damn fools!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.12.t: "The Radio Campaign Concludes"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.12.d: "Our political adverts have filled the airwaves for over a month now. Given the number of radios owned in Hungary, we've estimated that over ninety five percent of the population heard at least one political advertisment for the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty]. \n\nBy communicating our program in neat, bitesized chunks we've managed to steer the political conversation in the direction we want it to go, with the other parties scrambling to the airwaves later than us in order to try and present counter-arguments. We've broken political ground here, there's no doubt about it, and it shows the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] up as a technologically forward thinking party too."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.12.a: "A stroke of genius!"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.13.t: "The Kaiser visits Budapest"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.13.d: "Whilst the Imperial office is above such things as political endorsements, Kaiser Otto was happy to accept an invitation to Budapest at the behest of the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty]. The Kaiser reviewed a parade of the Hungarian Landsturm at Buda Castle, visited the Széchenyi Thermal Baths to take the waters there with his family, and then had a dinner with [DNF_HungarianElectionPartyLeader] and his associates at the nearby legendary Restaurant Gundel.\n\nRubbing shoulders with the Kaiser, and with the yellow press photographers in attendance, there are several photographs of the Kaiser having a good time with  [DNF_HungarianElectionPartyLeader] in shot, and even several of them shaking hands at the end of the meal. The publication of these images in the press provides the idea that the Kaiser has implicitly supported  [DNF_HungarianElectionPartyLeader], even if nothing is alleged or claimed by either party."
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.13.a: "We can use this"

krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.14.t: "Mobilising the Donauschwaben"
krg_dnf_regional_elections_hungary.14.d: "The Donauschwaben or Danube Swabians have lived in the lands of the great Hungarian plain since the 17th and 18th centuries, Despite differing origins, the new immigrants were all referred to as Swabians by their neighbor Serbs, Hungarians, and Romanians. The Bačka settlers called themselves Schwoweh, the plural of Schwobe in the polyglot language that evolved there. The majority of them boarded boats in Ulm, Swabia, and traveled to their new destinations down the Danube River in boats called Ulmer Schachteln. The Habsburg Empire had given them funds to build their boats for transport. The Napoleonic Wars ended the large-scale movement of Germans to the Hungarian lands, although the colonial population increased steadily and was self-sustaining through natural increase. Small daughter-colonies developed in Slavonia and Bosnia.\n\nAfter the formation of Austria-Hungary they were subject to the Magyarisation policy though with the Staatsrecht and the formation of Danubia this has fallen into the background. These people mostly take a role of living in their communities and not bothering much with politics in the higher realm, but that is something that the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] seeks to change this election.\n\nHaving sent special teams of Austrian and Hungarian activists through the Danube valley, they've increased the turnout of the region significantly, and more worthwhile, these people are mostly inclined to vote for the [DNF_HungarianElectionParty] due to a common alignment in principles, and the fact the party has made an active interest of them."

Under the eyes of the statues of many notable leaders including several Habsburg imperials, she rallied a crowd and gathered press attention to state that 'After years of being strong armed and forced into new political arrangements dictated from Vienna, the Hungarian nobility have had enough of seeing the old traditions stomped upon!'.\n\nThis appears to be some kind of political stunt, however the Apponyi woman has indeed sought to create a gathering of Hungarian nobles in Budapest during the election period in some kind of opposition to the national diet.

It appears whatever plan she intended has backfired on her, for it's riled up the workers and lower-classes against the nobility as opposed to any meaningful change in the structure of the Federation!"

krg_dnf.17.t: "Rusyns March to Protest Lack of Language Autonomy"
krg_dnf.17.d: "Mobilised by native intellectuals such as Stepan Klochurak and angry at feeling like strangers in their own land, a large number of people from the Rusyn minority in Karpatalija marched on the regional capital of Munkacs today. Police were surprised by the numbers of Rusyns who had traveled from the countryside, some coming from as far afield as Bukovina. Their protest was mostly peaceful, with a few isolated scuffles with some locals quickly broken up by the police.\n\nThe main demand of the protest was the inability of the Rusyn minority to perform functions of government in their own language in the region, whilst those in Galicia-Lodomeria a few miles away are able to do so due to the similiarity between their language and Polish."
krg_dnf.17.a: "There are limits to the Staatsrecht Principle, unfortunately."
krg_dnf.17.b: "Perhaps opening a language institute and legal recognition will placate them?"

krg_dnf.18.t: "Rusyn Language Academy opens its doors in Munkacs"
krg_dnf.18.d: "After several months of co-ordination and some wrangling with the central government in Budapest, the Karpatalija region has passed language autonomy legislation in the last few days to allow for the Rusyn language to be used in government. The federally funded Rusyn Language Academy in Munkacs opened its doors today, with a small celebration. Tensions seem to be lower in Karpatalija now, though the Hungarian National Diet are presently upset by this intervention there will no doubt be some other crisis or scandal that will change their willingness to cooperate with the Federal government in the future."
krg_dnf.18.a: "Ah, this is excellent news!"

krg_dnf.20.d: "Nine years ago the Danubian Federation was officially declared, and as has become tradition Kaiser Karl has given a speech commemorating this momentous day and discussing the future of our nation. In this case however he did not just talk about the need for unity, and for overcoming adversity as has been the theme of previous years. He disclosed his health had worsened, that he wished for an orderly succession in the House of Habsburg in the event of his early demise. Thus Kaiser Karl announced his intention to abdicate the Imperial throne of Danubia, allowing the Krone Prinz Otto to take over the reigns. Whilst tears were shed among the masses who had gathered to hear the speech, Hofburg insiders revealed that the Krone Prinz had been taking an increasingly involved stance in affairs of state for some time prior to this announcement, and is fully prepared for the monumental undertaking ahead of him."

krg_dnf.21.t: "Minister-President Elections"
krg_dnf.21.d: "After Minister-President Miklas has retired, someone must take up the task of being the perhaps the most powerful man in Danubia. The CSP-OKgFP go into closed conference and the party members establish they are quorate and then take a vote, with the requirement that the new chairman (and by extension, new Minister President) get at least 80% of the vote. After an indecisive first round, they adjourn from the salon at Hotel Sacher Wien and go to their haunts around the federal capital. There is much horse-trading in the closed backrooms of many smoky Viennese cafes, plans muttered over Helles in bars and after a hectic twenty four hours, the party members reconvene. This time, someone has cornered the vote. Let us congratulate the new ..."

The mass marches turned to violent protests after regional police forces engaged demonstrators with baton charges."

After a playoff round in two groups of 14, the top four teams go to the quarter-finals and play knockout style until only one remains.\n\nThis year the matches were held at the Wiener Heumarkt arena over a period of several days. The final match was between HC Slavia Praha and Innsbrucker EV. The two teams were resplendant in their uniforms and a good contingent from Bohemia had come to watch them via train in Slavia's distinctive red and white strip. Both sides had their top players all available, aside from team Slavia Praha's Jan Novak who was unable to play due to a calf-injury. \n\nUltimately the side from Slavia Praha bested their opponents Innsbrucker EV in a stunning 6-5 game, with the last goal being scored in the final minute of the third period by Jaromír Jágr for Slavia."

The final match was between HC Slavia Praha and Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet (BKE). The two teams were resplendant in their uniforms and a good contingent from Hungary had come to watch them via train. Both sides had their top players all available and in top form. \n\nUltimately the side from Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet bested their opponents in a decisive 8-3 game, with the last goal being scored too late by Jan Novak for Slavia."

The final match was between Innsbrucker EV and Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet (BKE). A massive contingent from Austria had come to watch them via train in Innsbrucker's strip. BKE suffered the loss of their lead goalscorer of the season, Ambrus Akos who had broken his leg falling into the Danube whilst drunk.\n\nUltimately the side from Innsbrucker EV struggled to achieve a victory despite Ambrus' absence in a close 4-3 game."

The final match was between HC Slavia Praha and Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet (BKE). The grudge match saw both sides fighting for the title after BKE took it from Slavia in 1949. The teams played hard and close, having made sure their teams were at peak physical fitness. BKE brought Ambrus Akos but kept him on the bench for most of the game, as his leg still didn't recover fully since last year. \n\nUltimately the side from Slavia managed to overcome BKE in one of the best games of Ice Hockey played in years.

The final match was between Ferencvárosi TC Jégkorong of Hungary and SK Ilirija of Ljubljana. A fierce battle occurred between both teams, neither of which had not been expected to make it past the playoff phase, with surprising and fast-paced play dominating a tight game.\n\nWith five minutes left in the third period however, Ferencvárosi managed to get a double-penalty due to roughing and checking by some of their younger players. This allowed SK Ilirija to score two times and finish the game 3-5 (F - I), with the last goal being scored by Oldřich Sedlák, a recent purchase from SK Zbrojovka Zidenice."

The final match was between HK Bratislava Slovan and Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet (BKE). Slovan fielded a strong team, with a number of young-bloods who brought a real tempo to the game, whilst the aging BKE team put up a good fight with their veteran's knowledge, lead by stalwart Ambrus Akos who had made his way to Captain.\n\nHowever age did not triumph over beauty, and Slovan took home the Danubian Cup for the first time, after a 5-2 match, to much adulation from their supporter's contingent!"

The final match was between HC Slavia Praha and HK Bratislava Slovan. Slavia Praha have regularly come out at the best of this, but the recent retirement of their coach has left some disorganisation in their ranks.\n\nThat was disorganisation that Slovan took advantage of without remorse. Their play was like watching a well oiled machine that slowly took apart the famed Slavia team. Ultimately the match went 7-4 in Slovan's favour."

Both teams had previously played in the knockout stage against one another, but this year they were able to filter to the top of the pile.\n\nThe steelworkers from Ostrava managed to hand Slovan a tight game that went back and forth, with high stakes throughout with the final five minutes seeing three goals and leaving the final score at 6-7 for Vítkovice after they sent their goalkeeper off to get a sixth man on the ice. Thus the Danubian Cup went to Moravia."

##Federalising the CSP decisions##

krg_dnf.88.t: "The Deal with the Országos Kisgazda- és Földmüves Párt Concludes"
krg_dnf.88.d: "Jokingly referred to as 'the new Ausgleich' by the hardworking organisers of the Party Organisation Board, they have managed to organise a deal with the Országos Kisgazda- és Földmüves Párt (OKgFP), with Zoltán Tildy providing a number of helpful interventions to smooth over personality clashes and unwork apparently intractable issues.\n\nLinguistic rights and the use of Hungarian as language of business will continue in the new party, as they had in the Balaton Bloc, but the Organisation board managed to keep the definitive legal text in case of deviation via translation to be with the German language text of any multilingual documents. Additionally it was stated that all documents would be at minimum in German and Hungarian in order to maintain understanding and communication within the party, to reduce ambiguity and to promote communication."
krg_dnf.88.a: "Excellent, thank goodness for Tildy's help."

krg_dnf.89.t: "Convincing the Christlichsoziale Partei"
krg_dnf.89.d: "While the Federalist wing of the Christlichsoziale Partei has no issues with the work of the Party Organisation Board, the Hardliners (or Falkengruppe as they refer to themselves) are another kettle of fish entirely. Engelbert Dollfuß, whilst discredited amongst the group made an attempt at returning to relevance by opposing this, though Leopold Figl ended up being their chief negotiator, and he was looking for a compromise rather than risk being left behind by progress.\n\nUltimately it boiled down to assurances that their voices would still be heard in the new re-organised party, as the CSP has been defacto 'First Among Equals' in the Balaton Bloc. The answer was that their voices would be heard, as loud as they were, no matter how the party was organised. This well-timed quip apparently sealed the deal, as the Hardliners have a certain appreciation for wit and swagger, it being their own primary stock in trade."
krg_dnf.89.a: "Thank goodness."

krg_dnf.90.t: "Strong-arming the HKSS"
krg_dnf.90.d: "The Croatian Christian Democratic Party is an old insitution in the Illyrian Crownland, but frankly it's not representative and has been struggling to oppose the SDAPD program in the region, especially due to the bullying tactics of their leader, Josip Broz. Simply put Ivo Perović's party hasn't been able to keep up with their opponents. A disbursal from the Federal Aid budget and a promise of a decent sinecure for Perovic (and of course full support if he should miraculously win the campaign in Illyria one of these years) will convince him to bring the region into the federal party.\nBut he wouldn't take us seriously if we didn't lean on him, it's simply how they do politics in Illyria."
krg_dnf.90.a: "Perović will do as he's told no doubt."

krg_dnf.91.t: "Persuading the Bohemians"
krg_dnf.91.d: "The Christlichsoziale Partei of Bohemia is mostly a Sudeten German institution, one that has struggled politically for some time within the larger organisation of the crownland. Their politics are more toward those of the Hardliners in the Austrian party, as they have a sense of being stuck as the junior partner in coalition when the civilisation of the land around them was once theirs to command. Their leader, Oskar Schindler is a prominent local industrialist and mostly is involved as politics as a tool to lobby for better business tax rates.\nHe would be willing to move the party into the Federal organisation, with the right assistance, but he is concerned the more hardline element of his party would try and have him out on his heels. He's provided a list to the Party Organisation Board who are taking care of it, contacting them individually and convincing them of the necessity of a federal party to protect the rights of the Sudetenlanders in Bohemia."
krg_dnf.91.a: "Thank god for Schindler's List."

krg_dnf.92.t: "Bribing the Galicians"
krg_dnf.92.d: "The Galicians are already caucusing as part of the Balaton Bloc, for them the danger is more that they will be forgotten. Sending a package that promised a comprehensive development aid for the crownland from the Federal budget provided plenty of incentive for party chief Adam Romer to make sure that his people were willing to take the next step.\nLifting regions like Galicia to a higher standard should be part of any Federal programme in general, it cannot hurt to get ahead of the curve by starting at the party level."
krg_dnf.92.a: "We'll send them more fertiliser than they know what to do with."

krg_dnf.93.t: "Educating the Slovakians"
krg_dnf.93.d: "Having suffered under Magyarisation policies for decades, a lot of political energy even today at the regional level is still focussed on the idea of Autonomy. Guarenteeing their rights and their voice in the federal party, as well as the understanding that regional politics will not be excessively meddled with is key to educating the Slovanska Krestanska Strana on our aspirations for them as part of the the DVP.\nThe party organisation board made sure that the right people have been given the relevant insights and motivations to make our case."
krg_dnf.93.a: "Their voice won't be drowned out amongst the hubbub."

krg_dnf.94.t: "Build Consensus Between the Main Players"
krg_dnf.94.d: "If we have two or three parties on side, we can present the majority of their platform as a fait accompli to the remainder. It is not perhaps as representative as the other method of gathering support would be, but it saves us on time and effort, and we can still work around the dealbreakers of the rest while also working past them much more quickly because we can treat them as a distinct bloc to negotiate with, rather than having six or seven seperate rounds of discussions.."
krg_dnf.94.a: "It is efficient!"

krg_dnf.95.t: "Strategic Concessions from the Less Populous Regions"
krg_dnf.95.d: "The smaller crownlands have to understand that while their rights are important to us, they must accept they have less pull, simply due to the arithmetic.\nSince they have fewer people, when it comes to making concessions to the final political program and manifesto of the new party, they have to be the ones to consider moving first. They might not like this, and it may smack of some Wien-diktat of old, but it is simply just part of the work of being in a Federal party."
krg_dnf.95.a: "Unfortunately it's just how it is."

krg_dnf.96.t: "Working with the Nations"
krg_dnf.96.d: "We should lay the ground for co-operation across the Danubian Federation by providing incentives to each crownland from the federal budget, should certain conditions be fulfilled. Whilst we are not going to state it explicitly that conditional is based on their willingness to work with the Federal government. Working with the Nations has to involve some carrot before we can bring in any stick.\nThe first round of disbursements will go to those regions that are led by regional governments allied to the Federal government. Those who miss out, will perhaps sit up and take notice and either change their stance to garner some investment.\n\nIf they do not, perhaps their electorates will."
krg_dnf.96.a: "There must be give, and take. For now we'll give."

krg_dnf.97.t: "The Cantonisation Plan"
krg_dnf.97.d: "Ongoing tensions between minorities and their regional governments keep causing headaches for us here in Wien.\n\nThese ongoing issues have been going on that the question of devolution has been very seriously considered by the federal government. Such that we have reviewed the original Popovici proposal from 1906 to see if there was something overlooked at Balaton when the Staatsrecht principle was drawn up. There is the interesting idea that we add autonomous regions based on ethnic lines where minority groupings have dominance locally, splitting the various staatsrecht territories into a mix of urban, minority and majority cantons.\n\nIt cannot be understated how controversial these proposals are and it would represent a significant alteration of internal crownland borders as well as a set of significant amendments to the originally agreed Balaton Principles."
krg_dnf.97.a: "Finalise the plans, we can proceed after we have an electoral mandate."

krg_dnf.98.t: "The Findings of the Kindl Commission"
krg_dnf.98.d: "After the review of the Federal organisational structure the Kindl commission, headed by notable Social Democrat Karel Kindl from the Bohemian crownland has found a disproportionate amount of personnel who originate from Austria. Whilst there are many mid and low level functionaries that can be replaced without much fuss, as well as many who are seeking the opportunity to get ahead in the competitive world of the Federal Civil service, there is also the question of the composition of the cabinet.\n\nDiscussion with the SDAPD has stated that they would be interested in replacing Raab in the FinanzAmt, and this is something they've desired for quite some time. In return they're willing to give the Justice Ministry to the Balaton Bloc, which given the Minister-President's current agenda might be a useful move. We can also fill the position with another individual from a minority, demonstrating that the commitment to equality reaches from top to bottom."
krg_dnf.98.a: "Make the trade, the Justice Ministry is more important right now."
krg_dnf.98.b: "We need Raab in the Finanzamt, regardless the optics."

krg_dnf.99.t: "Revising the Nationalities Act"
krg_dnf.99.d: "Ongoing tensions between minorities and their regional governments keep causing headaches for us here in Wien.\n\nThe primary root of these issues is that the Staatsrecht principle, whilst devolving autonomy to the crownlands does not provide opportunities for groups like the Italian minority in Welschtyrol and Istria, the Rusyns in Eastern Galicia and Karpatalija, the Donauschwaben in Hungary and Illyria, the Szeklers and Siebensburgen Sachsens in Transylvania. In fact in some cases the groups listed enjoyed authority previously and are now having to suffer the democratic tyranny of the majority, whilst others have been a minority since their inception, aside from in their local areas.\n\nThe proposal is that the Federal government would write an amendment to the Nationalities act that would revise it, elevating language autonomy for these groups within their respective crownlands as well as increasing it at the federal level.\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy about some of these - the re-elevation of German and Magyar in some regions would be viewed as backsliding on the commitments to language rights by the majority groupings in some crownlands. There would also be the question of whether minorities should receive some kind of preference for federal hiring decisions. It cannot be understated how controversial some of these proposals would be and it would represent a set of significant amendments to the originally agreed Balaton Principles and lead to several legal challenges against the validity of the amendment."
krg_dnf.99.a: "Finalise the plans, we can proceed after we have an electoral mandate."

krg_dnf.24.t: "Raab Outlines his Budget"
krg_dnf.24.d: "Julius Raab today presented his budget to the Federal Diet. After consultation with several business leaders of the larger corporations, the Federal Finanzamt as well as the heads of the national governments.\n\nThe document is... to put it lightly, dry. But it represents a concrete plan for the future of Danubia and has been calculated down to the last Krone. No doubt with the spending laid out in this plan, the continuation of Danubian economic development will proceed apace, and the profits of that development have been fairly divided between the regions that generate them and the Federal ministries that bring them together and oversee them."
krg_dnf.24.a: "Fascinating. He has obviously thought this through."

krg_dnf.25.t: "Meeting with the Austrian School"
krg_dnf.25.d: "The Austrian School, lead on this occasion by the noted economist Friedrich August von Hayek came to the Federal Finanzamt with a bold proposal for the stimulation of private investment in public markets and the deregulation of certain aspects of the economy in order to stimulate competition between business entities.. \n\nHayek's proposal is based closely in some respects on the details of his recently published book 'The Road to Serfdom', and has an obvious eye on the Black Monday crash of recent memory and the global reaction to these events. In the book and the proposal, Hayek condemns government intervention in the sense of central planning and mobilisation of economic means by the state as an infringement of personal liberties, and by extension democracy. He points to both Germany and the Commune of France as bad examples from differing ends of the political spectrum. His solution is to allow the market to allow 'our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority.' "
krg_dnf.25.a: "Hayek has some good ideas. We should adopt his proposal."

krg_dnf.26.t: "Reassuring the Minister-Presidents"
krg_dnf.26.d: "Federal Minister-President Wilhelm Miklas today met with the National Minister-Presidents of the Crownlands. He made the case that the presence of the Federal Economic Council was a boon to the nations of the state of Danubia by the fact its presence has proven a strong magnet for standardisation and interoperability. This allowed businesses in Transylvania to buy equipment from Bohemia without concern that the equipment may not work with existing parts purchased from other nations or within Transylvania. \n\nThe fact that electrical sockets were all modelled on the same mold, that the railways had the same gauge and that a rifle round made by Steyr-Mannlicher could be used with a Skoda-Zbrojovka gun without fear of the weapon being damaged or the bullet exploding in the barrel were pointed to as successes of the Federal Economic Council. \n\nThe Minister-Presidents seemed reassured that the role of the Council would be to advise and provide a basis for ongoing co-operation rather than dictating how the nations would be expected to perform their economic affairs."
krg_dnf.26.a: "Minister-President Miklas made the case for the Federal Economic Council very eloquently."

krg_dnf.27.t: "Dealing with Dollfuß"
krg_dnf.27.d: "Federal Minister-President Wilhelm Miklas today met with the leader of the Hardliner  wing of the CSP-OKgFP, Engelbert Dollfuß, to hear his demands with regards to the strengthening of the Staatsrecht Principle and the enlargment of regional economic autonomies. \n\nDollfuß expressed his dismay and disappointment, stating his belief that the basis of Danubia's continued strength was it's ongoing unity under the Kaiser and that the Staatsrecht could only go so far before the nation would be forced into a crisis by centrifugal forces that would rapidly spin out of control, if the centre was weakened. \n\nMinister-President Miklas retorted that trying to control and clamp down on these forces would just provoke violent unrest and cause those forces that Dollfuß was so concerned about to grow in strength and number. He reminded Mr. Dollfuß that those governed should be allowed to prove their own worth on the economic playing field and that government is by consent of the governed in Danubia."
krg_dnf.27.a: "Dollfuß stormed out under a cloud. No doubt he has his own agenda."

krg_dnf.28.t: "Tensions with the Vice-Minister-President"
krg_dnf.28.d: "Federal Minister-President Wilhelm Miklas was seen leaving his office after a conversation about the Federal Military Provisions for the Gemeinsame Armee with Vice-Minister-President Karl Renner of the SDAPD devolved into a shouting match. Unfortunately it has become obvious that tensions between the two men over this aspect of the Federal Budget are quite insoluble.\n\nWhile this does not spell the end of the Grand Coalition by any means, any further political maneuvres may find unexpected opposition at crucial moments, unless some way to reconcile around this argument can be found."
krg_dnf.28.a: "Oh dear. This isn't a good thing!"

krg_dnf.45.t: "The New World, and our place within it"
krg_dnf.45.d: "The world is taking a well deserved breath. The lightning maneuvre of the war has worked thin the nerves of many fine men, and whilst there are still stormclouds on the metaphorical horizon, the world can at least have a moment for itself to breathe.\n\nWhile we're catching our breath however, we must assess our position in the world. The shadow cast by Heimdallr is long and there are questions that we must ask of ourselves and of our allies the Germans. The most pressing concerns presently are the conflicts that have been frozen by the bomb's spectacular debut. The Pale Horseman remains an ever present irrational, dangerous threat in the east, and the situation in Italy is less than optimal.\n\nBeyond those immediate concerns, Danubia has a strong economic base, a good reputation in diplomatic circles and no burdensome colonial possessions that require constant attention. Domestic matters will likely determine our long-term foreign policy, but the current situation is good."
krg_dnf.45.a: "The war is over, but the peace must still be won."

krg_dnf.46.t: "Restoration of relations with the Kingdom of Italy"
krg_dnf.46.d: "Historically our involvement in Italy has led to tensions and bad blood. Our own Italian minority in Trieste and Sud Tyrol are still sometimes more trouble than we might wish to admit. However, through patient application of hard work and the ability to be magnanimous in victory, as well as our commitment to the cause of liberating Italy from the Syndicalist menace, we have managed to make a breakthrough.\n\nToday a formal memorandum of co-operation and fraternity between the governments of the Danubian Federation and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by their respective foreign ministers."

krg_dnf.29.d: "It was such an innocuous thing, a small and handwritten note in the Kaiser's handwriting. But it has the potential to reshape geopolitical reality. He suggested that, given the obvious love between his brother, the Archduke Robert and Margherita of Savoy-Aosta, that they should have a royal wedding in Vienna. Of course, with international observers to celebrate the happy couple.\n\nHe also added that, regardless of the ultimate marriage plans of the pair, it might be worthy that the two major players on the Adriatic Sea work in concorde and harmony as well, in reflection of the adoration held by the young lovers for one another.\n\nThe note was obviously formally typewritten and dispatched via diplomatic courier to Rome, with the signature and seal of the Kaiser at the bottom. Perhaps this represents a chance for peace to strengthen her hold on Europe after such a prolonged and violent decade."
krg_dnf.29.a: "We can only hope this will be the beginning of something good."

krg_dnf.161.t: "A Marriage Offer from Vienna" # REVIEW
krg_dnf.161.d: "A formal note has been sent to us from Vienna, by Kaiser Otto of the Danubian Federation. In it, he suggests that, given the obvious love between his brother, the Archduke Robert and Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta, that they should have a royal wedding in Vienna. Of course, with international observers to celebrate the happy couple.\n\nHe also added that, regardless of the ultimate marriage plans of the pair, it might be worthy that the two major players on the Adriatic Sea work in concorde and harmony as well, in reflection of the adoration held by the young lovers for one another, specifically guaranteeing passage across the Otranto Strait.\n\nPerhaps this represents a chance for peace to strengthen her hold on Europe after such a prolonged and violent decade? Or perhaps he is just trying to put a ridiculous bride price on his brother's love."
krg_dnf.161.a: "Yes, to both!"
krg_dnf.161.b: "Love is one thing, treaties another."
krg_dnf.161.c: "Margherita should find a new partner."

krg_dnf.162.t: "Yes - to all things!" # REVIEW
krg_dnf.162.d: "The marriage between Robert Archduke of Austria d'Este and Princess Margherita of Savoy, along with the treaty between the Italian Kingdom and the Danubian Federation, marks a significant political and diplomatic achievement.\n\nThe union between these noble families not only solidifies alliances but also brings political stability and cooperation between the two nations. It is a joyous occasion celebrated by both the nobility and the citizens, as it paves the way for stronger relationships and shared prosperity."
krg_dnf.162.a: "Excellent!"

krg_dnf_news.3.t: "Marriage between Danubian and Italian Royalty!" # REVIEW
krg_dnf_news.3.d: "In a heartwarming celebration of love and unity, Robert Archduke of Austria d'Este and Princess Margherita of Savoy tied the knot, transcending the divisive geopolitical landscape of the Kalterkrieg era. The grand ceremony, held in the historic city of Vienna, served as a reminder that amidst the cooling global relations and escalating tensions, love knows no boundaries.\n\nThe union between the noble families symbolizes a ray of hope in a polarized world. As the newlyweds exchanged vows, it was evident that their love story not only touched the hearts of the attendees but also captured the imagination of people worldwide. In a time where divisions seem insurmountable, the marriage between Robert and Margherita serves as a beacon of optimism and a testament to the enduring power of love.\n\nAs the world watches this love story unfold, it serves as a reminder that even in turbulent times, love can bridge divides and inspire a collective hope for a brighter future."

krg_dnf.30.t: "Keeping Russia Down"
krg_dnf.30.d: "The ceasefire in the Ukraine might mean the end of our tanks rolling over the steppe, but the border there is not one we wish to stay like that forever. We can keep the Russians destabilised and hurting through a few key choices, as well as supporting the partisans on the other side of the Dnieper. Savinkov is an irrational and dangerous foe, one who must not be allowed a moment's grace to regain his equilibrium. The Russians are a warlike people, with a scorned pride and a burning need for revanche for their lost lands. But that revanche also diverts them from the fact they surrendered those lands, and it diverts them from turning the bounty of their homeland into prosperity. By supporting the Ukrainians on the wrong side of the border, we are also diverting their attention further.\n\nAnd after all, if we do not keep their attention diverted, we may just end up being the sole focus of it."
krg_dnf.30.a: "Let us keep sticks beneath their feet so they do not look up."

krg_dnf.31.t: "Savinkov's Dirty Secret"
krg_dnf.31.d: "The Russian government has recently began a policy of 'Russification' in the Ukraine. From what we have gathered from our sources amongst the partisans, this amounts to an attempt to completely eradicate Ukrainian culture in 'New Russia'. There are roundups, and reprisals even against villages that have had no involvement in partisan operations as well as collective punishment for failures to speak Russian amongst groups that have historically never spoken it. It appears Savinkov is pursuing this policy as an end-goal to partisan resistance against his invasion, and as a purge to water the rich black soil of Ukraine with blood.\n\nIt is nothing but a policy of genocide, if the rumours are true."
krg_dnf.31.a: "We must denounce Savinkov and let the world know of this!"
krg_dnf.31.b: "Bury the report, we cannot trade in rumours."

krg_dnf.32.t: "Partisan Training Camp Opens in Wschodnija Galicia"
krg_dnf.32.d: "Far behind our lines in Ukraine, the best and brightest of the Partisans have been smuggled into the country in small groups in order to receive training. How to use their weapons, how to act as officers, squad tactics and some improvements to their already well honed tricks. There is also some return trading, as they remind our soldiers how to operate on more limited logistical means.\n\nThe secret facility is in the remote countryside, and only a few members of the Galician government are presently aware of it. Others will be informed if the need arises, but that seems doubtful."
krg_dnf.32.a: "Best keep things on a need to know basis."

krg_dnf.33.t: "Sending 'Special Advisors' to Ukraine"
krg_dnf.33.d: "With the stiffening involvement of our Alpenjagers and Marines, the Partisans should be able to move their insurgency to a higher tempo that will knock the Russians back on their heels. The Partisans are adept at what they do, but infiltrating our own men into the country will allow us to move to bolder operations, ranging further afield and spreading the partisan cry against the Russian oppressor further. \n\nBy sending these man into the battlezone, we're moving toward a greater intensity of unrest in the Ukraine for the Russians."
krg_dnf.33.a: "The Russians won't know what hit them."

krg_dnf.34.t: "Intensify the Insurgency"
krg_dnf.34.d: "We have the soldiers, and the partisans. We have the weapons. We have the plans in place. The question is now, whether we wish to continue with this. It is one thing to put sticks under the feet of the bear to make him clumsy. It is another to poke him in the eye with those same sticks. \n\nWe are now moving towards an intensity of operations that will provoke the Russians to greater punishments and reprisals, and possibly even attacks on our line of control across the Dniepr. This is the tipping point. Do we proceed with more aggressive operations, or do we scale back our involvement, and leave the Ukrainians to their war?"
krg_dnf.34.a: "To hell with caution, we need to keep Russia distracted."
krg_dnf.34.b: "We should play it safe. Provoking a war would be unwise."

krg_dnf.35.t: "Partisans Shell Russian Garrisons"
krg_dnf.35.d: "Using mortars provided by the Ganz-MAVÁG Werke and radio co-ordination via our special advisors who reconnoitred the area beforehand and found advantageous positions for observation, several Russian garrisons were hit by mortar strikes fired by partisan operatives. \n\nAt least a hundred Russian soldiers were injured in the attacks that took place across the occupied Ukraine. \n\nPartisans were able to retreat in good order and evade pursuit."
krg_dnf.35.a: "An outstanding operation."

krg_dnf.36.t: "Assassination of Regional Leaders"
krg_dnf.36.d: "In three separate attacks in the border region, leaders of the collaborationist government and Russian forces were killed. One partisan cell sent a man who threw a grenade into an open car that was passing, killing the driver and the officer in the backseat. A second cell targeted a government building with a truck bomb, detonating and destroying half the building in the force of the ammonium-nitrate explosion. The third attack was an ambush followed by a co-ordinated mortar strike that happened to kill a Russian major who was travelling as part of the military convoy.\n\nThe Ukrainians are obviously able to carry out their campaign without our further intervention, aside from a continued supply of arms."
krg_dnf.36.a: "Let the weapons flow, and the Russians bleed."

krg_dnf.37.t: "Partisans seize Zaporozhie"
krg_dnf.37.d: "The scope and extent of Partisan activity in Zaporozhie and Kherson has been enough that with the assistance of our special advisors, they have been able to completely force out Russian State forces from the region. The local garrison was overwhelmed after Partisan forces surrounded their barracks, and strung their patrols up outside before torching the buildings with petrol bombs. The uprising was so swift and effective that the defection of these two states to the Ukraine is a fait accompli \n\nIt is unknown however, how the Vozhd will react. "
krg_dnf.37.a: "He'll just take it, if he knows what's good for him."

krg_dnf.38.t: "Propaganda Leaflets into the Ukraine"
krg_dnf.38.d: "Firing propaganda leaflets packed into artillery shells has allowed us to incite some rebellion on the Russian side of the border. This is the beginning of our operation to move past the ceasefire of 1947 and to undermine the madman Savinkov.\n\nUkrainians must be reminded that they can be a free people, and that there are those willing to help them on their path to become free, out from under the Russian yoke."
krg_dnf.38.a: "The war is not yet over."

krg_dnf.39.t: "Smuggling weapons into the Ukraine."
krg_dnf.39.d: "Firing propaganda leaflets is one thing. But one cannot make a revolution on hope and paper alone. At key points along the Dnieper, the Russians have weaknesses in their line. Small boats can cross the river there, after dark, undetected. There is also the Sea of Azov and the route through Odesa. The borders of Russia are not as inviolable as claimed.\n\nSmuggling weapons does carry some small risk, if nothing else the fact they are of Danubian manufacture. But it can be justified as long as they are not caught directly importing it, Danubian weapons, even of reasonably modern manufacture are already in parts of the country. Increasing that small number to a flood will not be hard work."

## Arms Commission Events ##

krg_dnf.40.t: "Arms Commission Reviews Stockpiles"
krg_dnf.40.d: "The scope and extent of Danubian stockpiles of weapons after the Second Weltkrieg is immense. The Arms Commission has therefore being formed with an eye to assessing the medium and long term requirements surrounding the continued clearing of battlefields, and handling of excess to requirement weaponry. \n\nSeveral generals as well as functionaries from the Federal Diet and the Finanzamt are now meeting in the Hofburg in order to evaluate the information provided by the Gemeinsame Armee Munitionsbüro. They'll come to their conclusions over the next month or so, and set in motion the organisational processes to deal with this outstanding issue, as holding these weapons without a clear plan is a financial drain on the state."
krg_dnf.40.a: "Excellent, we will look forward to their recommendations."

krg_dnf.41.t: "Integrate Captured Equipment?"
krg_dnf.41.d: "After the end of the war there are still vast battlegrounds within the Ukraine strewn with destroyed and damaged tanks, artillery pieces, self-propelled guns as well as literal stacks of Russian weapons. Likewise we have access to large caches of supplies from the SRI in Italy.\n\nA decent amount of these weapons may be in a condition that we can make some technological development from them but most of them, whilst servicable, are obsolete. If we do integrate these weapons, we may have to spend energy reverse-engineering compatible ammunition in some cases. Ingesting these weapons into service would likely be more trouble than it's worth, especially given the strength of our own domestic arms industry. The Arms Commission therefore has to determine whether this is worthwhile."
krg_dnf.41.a: "We can extract anything of technological use without stooping to using booty. Sell or scrap the rest."
krg_dnf.41.b: "Give it to the Landsturm, they'll find a use for it."

krg_dnf.42.t: "Disposing of Obsolete Equipment."
krg_dnf.42.d: "Aside from the captured equipment of our enemies, we also have large numbers of weapons that were manufactured before and during the early years of the Second Weltkrieg, which are obsolete, if servicable. Even supplying the Landsturm, there is still a large amount of excess which are filling warehouse space in our arsenals. \n\nThe Arms Commission has come to the conclusion that we should look into disposing of these weapons, but the question is how to do this. We believe that we can use obsolete weapons for political gain and to supply our proxies directly, via a front-corporation 'Holtzberg Waffenhersteller'.\n\nThe question is do we also sell weapons to independent arms-dealers? The advantage here is that we will be able to move them more quickly and make some money at the same time. The danger is that they may end up being used against us, or our proxies."
krg_dnf.42.a: "Set up Holtzberg Waffenhersteller for exclusive export."
krg_dnf.42.b: "Sell directly! Holtzberg can have the remainder."

## Infra Tree Events ##

krg_dnf.43.t: "Formation of the Von Mises Commission"
krg_dnf.43.d: "The economists of the Austrian School have had some success in academic circles, and have written several documents on the subject of deregulating and liberalising the markets both globally and within the Danubian Federation.\n\nTheir ideas as well as the current economic success of the country mean that there is an opportunity for them to provide guidance and insight on the disbursement of the financial surplus in the Federal Budget."
krg_dnf.43.a: "Let's see if we can reinvest our profits."

krg_dnf.44.t: "The Revival of Zipernowsky's Ideas"
krg_dnf.44.d: "Karoly Zipernowsky, one of the inventors of the transformer, proposed the creation of high-voltage lines as a means to power electrified railways.\n\nHis designs have been studied and his ideas were always of interest, the electrification of the railways is now within our grasp. It is truly a great shame that he died at the age of 90 without seeing the Danubian Federation enacting his concepts. However, along with high-speed transportation, building a highspeed rail circuit would reduce time wasted in transit and allow for rapid movement of goods, troops and materials. Now we have an economy strong enough to make it a reality, and the political will to make it happen.\n\nThe construction of the electrified high speed rail loop through Danubia will facilitate the strengthening of our continued future."
krg_dnf.44.a: "A fitting memorial to a great mind."

## Nuke News Event ##

krg_dnf_news.4.t: "Danubia has the A-Bomb!"
krg_dnf_news.4.d: "With Germany continuing development of atomic weapons, there is no doubt that the Canadian government is also pursuing atomic weapons. The Danubians today joined the nuclear club as well.\n\nThe detonation of a Danubian designed and manufactured device at the Heimat testing grounds in Windhuk, German South West Africa has confirmed the Federation's great power status, with General Lothar Rendulić for the military and several notable Danubian scientists including Leó Szilárd, Ede Teller and Erzsébet Rona in attendance alongside their colleagues from German Nuclear Command.\n\nBy all accounts however, this fission device is only the first step in Danubia's nuclear ambitions, with hushed talk of an 'H-Gerät' being pursued. In a joint announcement to the press with Minister President Wilhelm Miklas, Kaiser Otto said that 'Danubia would seek the means by which to keep the hard won peace.'"
krg_dnf_news.4.a: "What are they going to do next?"

## Dollfuß Focus Tree ##
krg_dnf.58.t: "Prepare the Agricultural Renaissance"
krg_dnf.58.d: "A renaissance of agriculture can happen, given the right conditions. It is said that if properly managed, the Carpathian Basin and its rich loamy loess soil could feed all of Europe. The proper management is now in place.\n\nThe Minister President and his allies in the cabinet have close ties to the large agricultural business conglomerates in Austria and Hungary, that feed the nation and export food beyond our borders. The subsidies from the federal budget have been earmarked for the purchase of pesticides and fertilisers. For too long we have taken the wealth of the soil for granted, but with a fair deal of prodding and poking, Danubian ingenuity can make it provide food security for all within a generation.\n\nAfter all, this is the nation that brought Gregor Mendel and his peas into the world."
krg_dnf.58.a: "Let a thousand paprika flowers bloom."

krg_dnf.59.t: "Mobilizing The Landbund"
krg_dnf.59.d: "The Landbund represents the interests of both agriculture and heimat. The Danubian identity is one that is essentially agrarian, no matter what those pie in the sky socialists will sell you. When was the last time one of them actually got his hands dirty doing some honest fieldwork anyway?\n\nBy mobilizing these organisations, we can increase political support in rural areas, as well as increase agricultural productivity and enjoy the natural bounties that Danubia holds. The Landbund organisations also provide a useful, extra-governmental framework for advancing our social programmes through indirect means. It is sometimes better to convince someone they are wrong by having them see everyone around them come to that conclusion first."
krg_dnf.59.a: "The Landbunds will no doubt be useful."

krg_dnf.60.t: "Undermine The Grand Coalition"
krg_dnf.60.d: "The Socialists constantly nay-say, obstruct or 'compromise' motions proposed by the CSP-OKgFP down to insubstantial whimperings, far distant from their original meanings. We cannot achieve the vision that Minister-President Dollfuß has for Danubia with them in the government. So little birds must fly, and spiders must whisper in their webs. The days of the Grand Coalition are numbered. The CSP-OKgFP can do it alone.\n\nA smear campaign in Vienna and a second in Budapest will weaken support for them in the halls of power that matter the most, and some duplicity with regards to our words and actions in relation to our intentions with regard to the Socialists will put their hackles up, and pull the mainstream of the party away from the idea of continuing this devil's alliance with them."
krg_dnf.60.a: "Let's keep them on their toes."

krg_dnf.61.t: "Assess the Balaton Principles"
krg_dnf.61.d: "The Balaton Principles were worked out between various political groupings from the Crownlands of our Federation over a decade ago now.\n\nNo document is perfect, and it would be perhaps wise to reassess them in sight of our current leadership.\n\nThis is a controversial move but ultimately it will allow the government to actually govern the many peoples of this land, and streamline the passing of laws. With greater efficiency at the Federal level, and without having to drag our heels waiting for the regional leaders to come back for simple answers, Danubia might actually be capable of achieving something without being in Germany's shade."
krg_dnf.61.a: "Let them yammer, it is time for leadership."

krg_dnf.62.t: "The End of the Grand Coalition"
krg_dnf.62.d: "It can be hidden no longer, the cracks are past papering over. The socialists are practically frothing at the mouths themselves, unable to find a compromise they can bend our iron will to. The only thing stopping them from breaking this is that they do not wish to be the ones to move first.\n\nNo fear. We are quite capable of making the first move ourselves. Minister-President Dollfuß today sent a formal letter to the office of the SDAPD and another to the Vice-President in the Hofburg palace, informing them they are to vacate their offices in the government. The Grand Coalition is ended, and the CSP-OKgFP will attempt to form a minority government, for the time being. Given time there will be the opportunity to perhaps form a coalition with the liberals."
krg_dnf.62.a: "Excellent."

krg_dnf.63.t: "Dollfuß' 21 days and the No Confidence Vote"
krg_dnf.63.d: "After the initial break with the Democratic Socialists, the CSP-OKgFP initially seemed to be doing well. However the initial momentum they had was not to last. The Hardliner wing of the CSP-OKgFP managed to alienate enough members of the Federalist wing with their proud attitude and public mudflinging that dragged their own party name down, that when Karl Renner as the leader of the SDAPD - now on the opposition benches, called a vote of no confidence, the chamber found the two thirds necessary to overturn his Minister-Presidentship.\n\nWith the result of the vote in hand, Renner went to the Kaiser and received the right to form a new government. Now he has a choice. \nCan things with the CSP-OKgFP be rescued?\n Or should some of the junior parties be given a seat at the table?"
krg_dnf.63.dd: "After the initial break with the Democratic Socialists, the CSP-OKgFP initially seemed to be doing well. However the initial momentum they had was not to last.

krg_dnf.63.a: "Let's go back to how things were, with an SDAPD leadership..."

krg_dnf.64.t: "Karl Renner has died!"
krg_dnf.64.d: "The giant of the Social Democrat movement, the tireless Karl Renner has sadly left Danubia on this new year's eve. While he advanced in years, he never slowed in motion, a seemingly endless dynamo keeping him going consistently until all too quickly, it stopped. \n\nFamed for his concept of the 'Personal Principle' in the autonomy debate, as well as the essay of 'State and Nation', given the chance in politics to be a figure of note he did not shy away from trying his best to improve the lot of every Danubian every day that he worked. Notably he was a vehement anti-Semite, even when such attitudes were unpopular and it was a risk to his own wellbeing to vocally be such.\n\nKarl Renner died at the age of 80, leaving behind his wife Luise, his daughter Poldi, grandsons Hans and Karl, and granddaughter Frances.\n\nHis leadership of the SDAPD is succeeded by Adolf Schärf, who had been regarded as his heir apparent for some time."
krg_dnf.64.a: "A great man. A mighty intellect. He will be sorely missed."

## Now entering the Flavour Zone ##

krg_dnf.65.t: "The Federal and Royal Anthems"
krg_dnf.65.d: "Since 1788 the various incarnations of Austria and later Danubia have stood and sung allegiance to the National and Royal Anthem of 'Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser'. There are no plans to change the Royal Anthem to be played when the Habsburgs attend events.\n\nHowever, given the new form of Danubia and the fact it has been approximately a decade since the signing of the Balaton Agreement, Kaiser Otto suggested that it might be worthwhile to make a break from the past in order to cement the fact that Danubia is not meant to be the direct continuation of Empire under a softer face. Rather it is a truly new federation of nations on the world stage that replaces Austria-Hungary.\n\nThere are three proposed options: \n1) No change - whilst the Kaiser's idea is interesting, continuity is better.\n2) A version that uses the Haydn song, but adapts a poem by Ottokar Kernstock \n3) There is another proposal by a woman named Paula von Preradović, set to a Mozart piece.\n\nAll of them would be suitable, the matter is simply if we take the suggestion, and if we do, which." 
krg_dnf.65.a: "There's nothing wrong with 'Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser'."
krg_dnf.65.b: "We can keep the tune. But new words... 'Sei gesegnet ohne Ende' will do nicely!"
krg_dnf.65.c: "Danubia is a new place, and deserves something new. 'Land der Berge, Land am Strome.'"

krg_dnf.66.t: "Sarajevo Sokol Helps Unemployed Youth"
krg_dnf.66.d: "Members of the pan-slav gymnastics association in Illyria have recently been noted to be helping young men who have been suffering from the endemic unemployment in the mostly pastoral region. A lot of people in Bosnia, mostly youth, travel from the countryside looking for work in Sarajevo only to find a city that suffers from a lack of economic strength, despite regional government's best efforts.\n\nThe Sokol movement has been able to help by mobilising young men to perform voluntary acts of community service, such as clearing parks and roadways of litter and sweeping the streets. As a reward for this, young men are able to stay in dormitories owned by the organisation, and are given advanced notice of job opportunities in businesses owned by Sokol members. Ultimately the organisation is helping combat both unemployment and homelessness in the city, and can be seen as a good influence in the area, reducing tensions."
krg_dnf.66.a: "Ah, good news for once. Make sure to send something from the financial aid budget to Sarajevo Sokol."

krg_dnf.67.t: "Szekely Protest Lost Rights in Cluj"
krg_dnf.67.d: "While they are allowed their political representatives, and have their own organisations, and even speak their own language in Transylvania since it is one of the federal languages, the Szekely Hungarians today marched in the Transylvanian capitol of Cluj to protest against what they see as exclusionary actions by the PNR Romanian majority government.\n\nIt is sometimes said that equality feels like oppression when you have had privileges, and it certainly seems to be the case here. There are no specific problems they raise that are not also faced by Transylvania as a whole within Danubia. They just feel an extra burden, at having to suffer them on the same level as their former tenant farmers."
krg_dnf.67.a: "We live in the 20th century, not the 18th! Deal with it."

krg_dnf.68.t: "Prešov Report on Romani"
krg_dnf.68.d: "The Mayoral office of Prešov region recently issued a report on an epidemic of smallpox that broke out in a Romani village near to the city. The village was been founded by the Romani Voivoide during the period of Kaiser Joseph II and has been standing since the 18th century. The outbreak was resolved through the use of a cordon sanitaire, but the increased attention to the borough came with some shocking results. Health standards are low and diseases such as hepatitis, head lice, diarrhoea, scabies, and meningitis are common. Unemployment in the borough reaches almost 100 percent. It appears that living standards have not increased since the village's founding, if not backslid!\n\nWhile the relationship with the Romani community has been one that is fraught with tension, we should perhaps at least ensure the Roma who have settled and seek to be Danubian citizens rather than antisocial vagrants do not want for basics of life."
krg_dnf.68.a: "Unfortunate. Put a memorandum to Bratislava, let's see what they do."

krg_dnf.69.t: "Bet ha-Knesset ha-Gadol shel Budapesht"
krg_dnf.69.d: "The Jewish community of Budapest has recently celebrated the completion of the expansion to the Tabakgasse Synagogue complex. The previous expansion in 1931 to the synagogue was the Heroes' Temple for those Hungarian Jews who lost their lives in the first Weltkrieg, and the Jewish Museum built on the house that Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism was born in.\n\nHowever the Jewish community in Budapest continues to grow in numbers, and required a larger meeting space. They therefore purchased the building behind the synagogue and for the past three years have renovated it to match the distinct Moorish Revival style of the main complex. With the acquisition of the new property, the community will be able to move more administrative functions out of the main synagogue complex and turn over the space to the pursuit of worship and related occasions such as weddings, scriptural studies and funerals."
krg_dnf.69.a: "Ah fantastic."

krg_dnf.70.t: "Bratislava intervenes in the Prešov matter"
krg_dnf.70.d: "A special national level commission from the Slovak government has been formed to work in supporting the settled Romani communities throughout Slovakia, with special emphasis given to the uplifting of the community near Prešov. Dispatch of a doctor to the village, as well as hiring local men to dig ditches to allow for the installation of proper sewage and water pipes, as well as electrification of the village are the first steps in what is being considered a model program to roll out through the crownland with regards to dealing with backwardness in the eastern part of the country. \n\nThere is even discussion that this might be worth pursuing in other crownlands, and the Hungarian, Transylvanian and Galician governments have sent observers to report on the progress of the modernisation program."
krg_dnf.70.a: "A constructive response. Very good."

krg_dnf.71.t: "Serbian Minority involved in violence near the Border"
krg_dnf.71.d: "The Banat has always been a tinderbox, but recent agitation by Belgrade has the local Serbian population protesting in the streets of Temesvar. They're protesting their trouble with employment due to language difficulties. However as part of the Hungarian crownland there is little recourse for them under the Staatsrecht principle.\n\nThe local authorities response had been to arrest and attempt to deport the protestors to Serbia, but the border garrison refused to process paperwork without federal authorisation. Once the central ministry was aware, Budapest was contacted and all were released and allowed to return to their homes. The local authorities have been disciplined and several key personnel in the decision have resigned."
krg_dnf.71.a: "What were they thinking?!"

krg_dnf.72.t: "Siebensburgen Saxons complain about Transylvanian Government treatment"
krg_dnf.72.d: "The Siebensburgen Saxons are the German minority in Transylvania. Historically business and craftsmen they were generally an urban grouping who moved to the region after the Ottoman Turks were pushed out during the 16th Century. \n\nDue to their status as mostly bourgeois and urban they have felt that recent measures in the field of taxation by the Transylvanian regional government have been specifically aimed at them and impeding their livelihoods. Whilst there is no explicit bias to the laws on paper, anecdotal evidence points to it being handled much more permissively when Vlach interests are on the line. As such the Saxons have sent a formal petition to Wien. Unfortunately there is no precedent for direct Federal interventions in this matter, and we do not want to set one in this case lest it look like a case of 'old Empire, new clothes'. The best we can do is a memorandum to Cluj."
krg_dnf.72.a: "Tell the PNR to enforce the law fairly at least."

krg_dnf.73.t: "Istrian Unrest"
krg_dnf.73.d: "The Italian minority in the port city of Trieste have come out in protest of recent changes to the requirements for the secondary school leaving exam in the region. The Austrian Diet recently passed new legislation relating to the leaving exam and apparently an oversight was made with regards to the language requirement. Whilst all students are expected to be fluent in both their mother tongue and German, the exam is generally an oral examination, and there are concerns amonst the Italian minority that this will lead to disadvantaging of their students. The official reason for this change is due to the lack of available examiners proficient in Italian, without personal bias toward the applicants.\n\nDue to the unrest, additional requests are being made for more Italian speaking examiners throughout Austria and the policy appears to be rolled back, but this has kicked up a needless fuss."
krg_dnf.73.a: "They should have thought it through more closely!"

krg_dnf.74.t: "Steelworkers go on Strike in Ostrava"
krg_dnf.74.d: "The 'Steel Heart' of Danubia stopped beating today as the Český svaz kovoobráběčů (ČSK), Czech Union of Metalworkers went on strike. The reason for downing tools is the fact there have been vast increases of productivity from pre-war levels and apparently a lot of hidden overtime that hasn't been compensated for, especially with the end of war-measures.\n\nWhile the workers have a point, the regional government is so far letting the owners deal with the strikers, and police haven't reported any suspicious or radical underswells. They will be keeping an eye on affairs however."
krg_dnf.74.a: "Let's make sure this stays about wages."

krg_dnf.75.t: "The Steelworkers in Ostrava go back to work"
krg_dnf.75.d: "While the union did have some legitimate grievances, a clique of radical syndicalist activists was uncovered by the police. There is a federal arrest notice on Artur London and two other men, since they were found to be attempting to radicalise the workers with Syndicalist literature and illicitly published newspapers. One of their cell was captured distributing newspapers and has turned over all information he knew about them, including the location of the subversive press. Legal action has been brought against the owners in this case.\n\nThe leadership of the strike appears to be made up of level-headed working men who weren't to be swayed by such nonsense, and they've managed to strike a legitimate deal with the owners who have agreed to back pay overtime as well as expand the investment in the mill there. With these conditions met, the Union called off the strike and went back to work, aside from a few radicalised individuals."
krg_dnf.75.a: "No doubt the ringleaders will be run to ground."

krg_dnf.76.t: "The End of Artur London"
krg_dnf.76.d: "Artur London was born in Ostrava, to a Jewish family. His induction into radical politics happened somewhere after the first weltkrieg and he'd been involved in the radical fringe in Bohemia in various capacities as a low-level operative until Danubia joined the Second Weltkrieg. At that point he'd been picked up at an anti-war rally by Bohemian police and served three years at the Hrad Špilberk, 'the Prison of Nations' in Brno until the war ended. \n\nAfter that he apparently returned to Ostrava and picked up his pre-war pasttimes, except that some of the older hands who had been involved in the movement had either given it up completely, or gone abroad to fight for the Third Internationale and died or been held in German custody. \n\nThis was his first leadership action, and it will be his last it seems. He had gone to ground in the neighbourhood he had grown up in, overly confident in his ability to pass unnoticed, or perhaps that his community would shelter him from the police. Whatever his thinking, he had a pistol and fired on the police when they arrived at a known associate's apartment with a warrant. The police responded in kind and in the exchange of fire, London was shot in the chest. The police were unable to stop the bleeding or get him into a hospital on time, so unfortunately he could not stand trial."
krg_dnf.76.a: "'Revolutionary Glory' indeed. He would have only served time."

krg_dnf.77.t: "Jewish Businessmen in Krakow Harassed"
krg_dnf.77.d: "The Jewish community in Krakow filed an official complaint to the government of Galicia-Lodomeria over the harassment of several leading businessmen within the city by the Polish residents there. The recent development of businesses and industry in the region, one of the historically poorer parts of the Federation, has lead to some friction. The Jewish community, due to the diaspora nature of their people have the ability to make business contacts throughout the Federation and abroad. Meanwhile the local Poles are too busy navel gazing and mourning their seperation from their brothers to the north. Their nationalism diverts their attention and energy from bettering their lives in the here and now, and then they see the wealth their neighbours amass and attack them for it.\n\nThe resolution is simple, steps must be made to increase the standard of living in Galicia."
krg_dnf.77.a: "Envy is such a terrible thing."

krg_dnf.78.t: "Reichenberg Sudetenlanders complain about Bohemian government"
krg_dnf.78.d: "The city of Reichenberg on the northern border with Germany has one of the largest concentrations of German speakers in Danubia outside of Austria proper. The Sudetenland itself is arguably more Austrian than Bohemian, but the land has been only Germanised in the past five centuries or so. As such the Bohemian government and national sensibility would be greatly offended by any Austrian intervention in the running in the place. The fact of life is that the minority in Reichenberg is practically a crownland within the crownland, which means that any complaint about the national government has to go to the federal level.\n\nUltimately though, the details of the issue are that the Czech government is trying to promote the Czech language to a greater degree throughout the crownland, as is within their rights under Staatsrecht rules. This chafes somewhat for the Sudetenlanders, who prefer to use German. Since German is a federal language it is mostly a case of social discomfort rather than anything serious, as each side prefers their own language and has the right to use their own. Ultimately those who can speak a bit of both, can make a decent wage out of this impasse."
krg_dnf.78.a: "Bilingualism is the way forward."

krg_dnf.79.t: "The Kaiser tours Illyria"
krg_dnf.79.d: "The Adriatic Sea is a beautiful one, and as the Kaisers have for hundreds of years, Kaiser Otto is taking a short holiday in Illyria. The route starts with a royal visit to Zagreb then down along the coast. The imperial family are pausing at several stops along the coast, including Senj, Zadar, the isle of Krk and then on to Dubrovnik by boat. After their stay in Dubrovnik there was a royal visit to Sarajevo.\n\nThe imperial motorcade arrived at the Town Hall, having followed almost the exact same route as the Archduke in 1914. The royal security officers were on their best behaviour, and didn't repeat any of the mistakes of the previous occasion. \n\nThe Kaiser gave a speech to adoring and cheering crowds there, with amongst other comments the remark that 'it has been too long since the Habsburgs had visited Sarajevo'.\n\nAfter the speech the imperial motorcade headed toward Vukovar without any troubles, though the royal security officers were tense until they'd left Bosnia."
krg_dnf.79.a: "Too long indeed!"

krg_dnf.80.t: "Hledáme písničku pro všední den"
krg_dnf.80.d: "A twenty four year old Jazz Singer named Vlasta Průchová has won the talent contest 'In search of a song for the weekday' with her musical stylings. Her victory represents the growth of the big-band Jazz orchestra style that is popular in the American States. The music has been slowly travelling across the Atlantic, as gifts and presents between businessmen and other jetsetters, as well as with those who represent nations. The style is growing in popularity and marks a vast difference between the folk and Klezmer styles of Danubia. What comes next with modern music will no doubt be of further interest, as these things continue to grow and evolve. But for the time being, it seems that Jazz is here to stay."
krg_dnf.80.a: "Congratulations Ms Průchová!"

krg_dnf.81.t: "The Arrest of Hubert Pilčík"
krg_dnf.81.d: "A former employee of the Škoda Plzen factory, Hubert Pilčík was investigated in the relation to the disappearance of Renata Balleyova after the latter's remains were found in a sandy pit near his home. Her leg was found poking out of the ground by some local children who were playing there. She had been gagged and had the remains of a rope around her neck. After some investigation, the local police found that Ms. Balleyova had several meetings with Pilčík at her photo atelier.\n\nOn investigation of the retired locksmith's home, a small arsenal of various weapons was found, as well as a 12 year old girl who transpired to be Ms Balleyova's cousin. Pilčík was keeping the girl in the cellar of his property and abusing her sexually. The father of Ms Balleyova - Emmanuel Balley, and his niece had met with Pilčík as well, and he took Balley to the countryside before killing him and incinerating the remains.\n\nConsidered dangerous, a special team of several police officers enacted the warrant on his property. He was captured by surprise and taken alive."
krg_dnf.81.a: "It's enough to keep you from sleeping at nights."

krg_dnf.82.t: "The Trial and Sentencing of Hubert Pilčík"
krg_dnf.82.d: "The 'Beast of Plzeň', as the press throughout all of Danubia has dubbed him, finished his trial at the Supreme Court of Bohemia in the city of Brno. The case has attracted a fair amount of media attention and the case was put to the highest level by the national authorities immediately upon the revalation of the full extent of his crimes. Facing no chance of appeal and struggling to find a lawyer, the state ultimately had to provide a defence lawyer.\n\nThe evidence was overwhelming. Between the association of the Balleys with Pilčík, the fact that Emmanuel Balley had to be identified by his dental records from his charred remains, and of course the testimony of the poor unfortunate girl, the trial was brief too. The jury returned a guilty verdict within twenty-four hours and the judge passed down that Pilčík was to be executed by hanging, to be enacted within seven days."
krg_dnf.82.a: "Justice is served."

krg_dnf.83.t: "Poor Harvest in Wschodna Galicija"
krg_dnf.83.d: "Due to a series of heavy storms and an early cold snap, it looks like the harvest this year in Wschodna Galicija will be one of the worst since before the war. The regional government has put aside some funds for this scenario but no doubt this will trigger some movement of people off the land and into the cities in order to escape the threat of starvation. An agrarian area with unfortunately poor soil, one bad harvest can really provoke turmoil in the region. There is not much danger of mass unemployment as the oil industry in Galicia can always stand more drill workers but the pressure on housing in the cities and the rising of food prices due to goods needing to be imported from Hungary will create some discontent and instability in the crownland."
krg_dnf.83.a: "Drat"

krg_dnf.84.t: "Agribusinesses expand operations in Hungary"
krg_dnf.84.d: "With the favourable tax regime passing the Federal Diet, Agribusinesses in Hungary have expanded their operations across the Carpathian plain, creating new jobs and economic opportunities in the area. The consolidation and mechanisation of the Carpathian plain will no doubt provide additional financial and social benefits for all of Danubia."
krg_dnf.84.a: "Fantastic"

krg_dnf.166.t: "Ján Stanislav publishes 'Dejiny slovenského jazyka'   "
krg_dnf.166.d: "Noted Slovak linguist Ján Stanislav today published the first volume of his 'Dejiny slovenského jazyka' (History of the Slovak Language), the first book he has released since his 1948 'Slovenský juh v stredoveku' (The Slovak South in the Middle Ages).\n\nThe Professor at the Comnenius University in Bratislava has provided a detailed book that covers among other topics: historical linguistic shifts in Slovakia, the interaction with and foundation of the Hungarian state, the West Slavic shift from G to H and generally the use of the Old Slovak language.\n\nThis document provides a strong basis for further examination and is the clear result of years of work."
krg_dnf.166.a: "A most stimulating read!"

## 1948 Federal Minister President Chain ##

krg_dnf.100.t: "Wilhelm Miklas Resigns"
krg_dnf.100.d: "Having spent the best part of his career presiding over the Danubian government prior to and then during the Second Weltkrieg, Wilhelm Miklas has decided that he has had enough of politics. His career has been long and storied and he has decided that unlike many career politicians that he can afford to go out on a high, certain that his successors will be competent enough to steer the ship of state after he has departed the helm. The war certainly aged him, and it is not a great shock that having signed the peace budget, he has chosen to allow another to administer its many outcomes.\n\nFor the time being, Alcide De Gasperi as Federal Speaker of the Diet has taken up the post as interim Chairman."
krg_dnf.100.a: "A pleasant retirement, Herr Miklas"

krg_dnf.101.t: "The Minister-President Race Begins"
krg_dnf.101.d: "After Minister-President Miklas has retired, someone must take up the task of being the perhaps the most powerful man in Danubia. The CSP-OKgFP adjourn from the salon at Hotel Sacher Wien and go to their haunts around the federal capital. There is much horse-trading in the closed backrooms of many smoky Viennese cafes, plans muttered over Helles in bars and the race to be the next leader of Danubia is officially on."
krg_dnf.101.a: "We will see who comes out on top."

krg_dnf.102.t: "An Opportunity in Austria"
krg_dnf.102.d: "The Austrian Minister-President has retired. There is a chance therefore that we can help them elect an individual who would be aligned with our viewpoint in international and domestic matters. Engelbert Dollfuß has made no secret of his appreciation for the style of rule currently in Berlin and could be expected to emulate it in Danubia."
krg_dnf.102.a: "Send Support to Herr Dollfuß."
krg_dnf.102.b: "We dont need to meddle in Vienna, they'll stay loyal to their 'Brother'."

krg_dnf.103.t: "The Kaiser Picks his Man"
krg_dnf.103.d: "The German government have made it quite obvious that they're going to interfere in our election with an eye to getting Engelbert Dollfuß in charge. Whilst it is not to the extent of outright manipulation, the hardliners have a certain swagger in their walk knowing that they've got foreign backing for their candidate. Still, the party democratic process is difficult to interfere with and Danubia can weather the storm of German displeasure if needed, but some may choose to vote for Dollfuß so there is no need to."
krg_dnf.103.a: "Well, the Hardliners now have a chance..."

krg_dnf.104.t: "The Federalists Meet"
krg_dnf.104.d: "In the smoky halls and backrooms of Vienna, a decision is made several times between several groups of individuals. Then runners go from cafe to restaurant to dance hall and so on communicating to the others what their original group came up with. They return with the answers of the other groups they visit. Then the conversation starts over again. Eventually the groups seem to come to a conclusion and meet in kellerbar of the Wien Rathaus, letting the candidates know who the bulk of the Federalist movement back."
krg_dnf.104.a: "Economic Minister Raab gets the nod."
krg_dnf.104.b: "The Italian secures the Caucus' support."
krg_dnf.104.c: "Both politicians enter the running."

krg_dnf.105.t: "Matters of the Military"
krg_dnf.105.d: "Whoever becomes the leader of Danubia will have to deal with the questions not answered by the passing of the Peace Budget. The most urgent of those is whether or not to change the current policy relating to the military. There are arguments on both sides of the fence as to whether or not the current ceasefire is any more than a temporary pause before another great war, or if this is going to herald a new era of uneasy peace as the world digests the fact of the German atomic device."
krg_dnf.105.a: "Savinkov still looms, we cannot demobilise!"
krg_dnf.105.b: "We're at peace now. Conscription Must Go!"

krg_dnf.106.t: "Matters of Europe"
krg_dnf.106.d: "Europe is in ruins. The Third Internationale ruined the Ruhr, scorched Italy and destroyed Britain. What they didn't damage, the burdens of war and battle swept aside. Of all the nations in Europe, Danubia is one a vanishingly small number which did not suffer some kind of significant war damages during the second weltkrieg. Further more it is one of the few that still maintains almost it's entire industrial base intact.\n\nMinister Leopold Figl has come forward with an ambitious plan to both ensure war will not happen again, and that the Mitteleuropa and perhaps even beyond, will be rejuvenated. The dedication of the energies of Danubian industry to rebuilding Europe in order to strengthen the continent into the future, against interference from both the Anglo-French alliance and the Russian spectre."
krg_dnf.106.a: "Applaud Figl, it is our duty to rebuild the continent."
krg_dnf.106.b: "Figl's plan is sound, but we musn't work outside of our means."

krg_dnf.107.t: "Matters of the Federation"
krg_dnf.107.d: "The old saw goes 'Foreign Policy is Domestic Policy'. Nowhere is that more true than in Danubia. As a relatively new, yet simultaneously old nation there is a constant trend to self evaluation, as well as reference to the agreements that were drawn up when Danubia was formed. The Balaton Principles, despite being signed over a decade ago now, are still a topic of discussion. Some believe they went too far and dissolved the glue that bound that nation. Some believe they are good enough for the moment. Some think they didn't go far enough, and a more radical approach is needed.\n\nUltimately, the stance of the candidates may decide the election."
krg_dnf.107.a: "A Strong Executive will bind us together."
krg_dnf.107.b: "We have to uphold the Balaton Principles."
krg_dnf.107.c: "Balaton didn't go far enough, the Minorities need representation!"

krg_dnf.108.t: "An Emergency Caucus"
krg_dnf.108.d: "To the alarm of the Federalist wing and their allies in the SDAPD, Engelbert Dollfuß appears to be making waves in the election to the point that if he is not opposed by a unity candidate then he will win the election and with it, become the leader of all Danubia. His policy direction and manner of doing business threaten to upend the fragile balance that has thus far held the nation together. The question is whether we should take our own extra-ordinary measures to stop him."
krg_dnf.108.a: "The Federation is too important, we must concentrate our votes."
krg_dnf.108.b: "Let the Democratic Process proceed."

krg_dnf.109.t: "Engelbert Dollfuß Elected Christian-Bloc Leader"
krg_dnf.109.d: "Engelbert Dollfuß, from humble origins in Hollabrunn, has ascended to the highest governmental office in the Danubian Federation. He is considered somewhat authoritarian in his techniques and tactics. He also has rumoured associations that the German government influenced the CSP-OKgFP to vote for him. Regardless, he's made his way to the top. The question is now that he has the power, what will he do with it?"
krg_dnf.109.a: "Good Luck, Dollfuß."

krg_dnf.110.t: "Alcide de Gasperi Elected Christian-Bloc Leader"
krg_dnf.110.d: "Alcide De Gasperi was born in Pieve Tesino, the son of a policeman of modest means. His career to the upper echelons of politics has been a path of balance between advocating for his national minority and his passionate defence of Christian Democratic principles. His good relations with the Vatican and his passion for his Danubian motherland will provide plenty of opportunities in the Italian arena."
krg_dnf.110.a: "Good Luck, de Gasperi."

krg_dnf.111.t: "Julius Raab Elected Christian-Bloc Leader"
krg_dnf.111.d: "The offspring of a middle-class family from Sankt-Polten, Julius Raab has ascended to one of the highest peaks of power in Danubia. His career thus far has been first fighting on the Italian and Russian front in the First Weltkrieg, then a brief stint of University, and a rise through the political layers of the CSP-OKgFP. He is a steady hand on the tiller, that represents a continuation of Miklas's politics."
krg_dnf.111.a: "Good Luck, Raab."

krg_dnf.112.t: "Tildy Zoltán Elected Christian-Bloc Leader"
krg_dnf.112.d: "Tildy Zoltán, a Hungarian from Losonc in the Slovakian Crownland, has ascended to the highest governmental office in the Danubian Federation. He is a well respected and pious man. Now he's the first Hungarian Minister-President to a Habsburg Emperor and truely an example of how far Danubia has progressed. The question is now, how much further will it go with him in charge?"
krg_dnf.112.a: "Good Luck, Tildy."

krg_dnf.114.t: "Raab's Successor at the FinanzAmt"
krg_dnf.114.d: "Having become Christian-Bloc Leader and therefore head of the Danubian Government, Herr Raab finds himself holding one portfolio too many. A transition must be made and a new Finance Minister appointed from among the ranks of the CSP-OKgFP.\n Fortunately there are several suitable candidates for the role, the question is simply who to pick."
krg_dnf.114.a: "Some young blood deserves it, Fritz Bock gets the job."
krg_dnf.114.b: "A steady hand is needed in the FinanzAmt, Eduard Heinl gets the job."
krg_dnf.114.c: "Commiserate the Hardliners, Udo Illig gets the job."

krg_dnf.115.t: "Expanding the Welfare State"
krg_dnf.115.d: "How can wealth persuade poverty to use its political power to keep wealth in power? Here lies the whole art of Conservative politics in the twentieth century. Part of that is improving the material conditions. The Social Democrats are strongly behind us on this, having wished to do something in this vein for several years.\n\nWith the Second Weltkrieg in recent memory, this is the sort of policy that even the staunchest fiscal conservative can agree that the men and women of Danubia have earned through honest, hard work and much blood, sweat and toil. There is no real question about this policy, it is simply making the funds available from the federal budget."
krg_dnf.115.a: "Our names will go down in history for this!"

krg_dnf.116.t: "Re-Establishing Our Italian Presence"
krg_dnf.116.d: "Danubia is the successor of the Holy Roman Empire, through the Habsburgs. While there is no intention of seeking to dismember the newly reformed state of Italy, there is a history there that is the basis of the diplomacy between our two nations. That history leads to the close diplomacy. Our mutual interests are both economic, and military. The question is therefore whether asking for bases on their territory will be construed as further interference, or an understood insight to the dual nature of our two nations, despite our differences.\n\nRegardless of how it may be construed, the Foreign ministry has written a comprehensive request, and the delivery of the packet simply awaits the signature of the Minister-President."
krg_dnf.116.a: "Signed, sealed, and delivered."

krg_dnf.118.t: "A proposition from Danubia"
krg_dnf.118.d: "Citing history, economic ties and military agreements between our two nations, the Danubians have filed a request to reopen the aerodrome at Campolargo, stage military barracks on our territory, and defend our borders and our neutrality as a 'partner-state' to the Danubian Federation. The fraternal cooperation between our two countries has been ongoing since the restoration of relations with the Republican government.\n\n The Minister-President's request is reasonable, though there are obvious concerns that we are allowing ourselves to be potentially manipulated by outside parties."
krg_dnf.118.a: "Our names will go down in history for this! Approve it."
krg_dnf.118.b: "We're no puppet, nor do we need their partnership. Denied."

krg_dnf.119.t: "A proposition from Danubia"
krg_dnf.119.d: "Citing history, economic ties and military agreements between our two nations, the Danubians have filed a request to reopen the aerodrome at Campolargo, stage military barracks on our territory, and defend our borders and our neutrality as a 'partner-state' to the Danubian Federation. Whilst the Danubian government had close relations with the Republicans they setup in the territory of the former SRI, their relation with Italy has been rather aloof.\n\n The Minister-President's request is mildly unreasonable, since we are already in a good position and this feels like an obvious attempt to have us manipulated by outside parties."
krg_dnf.119.a: "Our King sees no need to bow his head to the Habsburg Yoke. Denied."
krg_dnf.119.b: "We shouldn't be hasty, let's see how it goes. Approve it."

krg_dnf.120.t: "Our mutual interest recognised"
krg_dnf.120.d: "Proof that even a republic and a monarchy can co-exist as partners, our assurances and request have been successful. The Italian Republic has joined us as a  'partner-state' so that we might continue to support the fragile democracy on the Italian Peninsula after the stresses of reunification. There is even some fanciful talk in certain naive circles that in perhaps five or ten years, we might be able to consider Italy as an applicant to the Danubian Federation.\n\nMore level heads have of course pooh-poohed the notion. Danubia has plenty to concern itself with already without going further into Italy, and we should be satisfied that we have been able to achieve this peacefully."
krg_dnf.120.a: "Fantastich!"

krg_dnf.121.t: "Our mutual interest denied"
krg_dnf.121.d: "It seems no matter how good the relations between the two, a republic and a monarchy cannot co-exist as partners. Friends maybe, but not partners. The Italian Republic has declined the invitation to be formally recognised as our 'partner-state' despite the military, economic and social benefits that both sides would have gained. Nonetheless we will still continue to support the fragile democracy on the Italian Peninsula after the stresses of reunification. There is some fanciful talk in certain hardline circles that we should, if our friendship has been refused, we should instead show how we treat our foes.\n\nMore level heads have of course pooh-poohed the notion. Danubia has plenty to concern itself with already without going further into Italy, and we should be satisfied that we have been able to achieve what we have already, without imperial adventures or invasions."

krg_dnf.122.t: "Our mutual interest recognised"
krg_dnf.122.d: "It was a long shot, but the mutual interests of two monarchies the in the continuation of the royal lineages that make our nations great. The respect that the Kaiser holds for the Italian King and his respect for our Kaiser meant that  our assurances and request have been successful. The Piedmontese Monarchy have led Italy to join us as a 'partner-state' so that we might continue to support the fragile democracy on the Italian Peninsula after the stresses of reunification. There is even some fanciful talk in certain naive circles that in perhaps five or ten years, we might be able to consider Italy as an applicant to the Danubian Federation.\n\nMore level heads have of course pooh-poohed the notion.

krg_dnf.123.t: "Our mutual interest denied"
krg_dnf.123.d: "It was a long shot, but the mutual interests and respect of two monarchies apparently are not enough to overcome the strains of the reunification and the suspicions of the Italian people. The Piedmontese have declined the invitation to be formally recognised as our 'partner-state' despite the military, economic and social benefits that both sides would have gained. Nonetheless we will still continue to support the fragile monarchy on the Italian Peninsula after the stresses of reunification. There is some fanciful talk in certain hardline circles that we should, if our friendship has been refused, we should instead show how we treat our foes.\n\nMore level heads have of course pooh-poohed the notion.

krg_dnf.123.a: "We can still care for our friends to the South, even if they don't care for us."

krg_dnf.124.t: "A Meeting At The Hofburg"
krg_dnf.124.d: "Kaiser Otto called Minister-President Dollfuß in for an extraordinary meeting today to express his concern about the current actions of the government, specifically in breaking their coalition with the SDAPD and moving the country onto a course which threatens the balance that had been carefully built over the past few decades.\n\nWhilst the Minister-President remained respectful, he stated his belief that the continuation of the coalition was more of a threat to the nation than the short-term pain of losing the SDAPD from government would be. The Kaiser reminded the Minister-President that while he may see Danubia as a nation of Germans and perhaps Hungarians, that there were many other groups that Otto was the Monarch of, and that he would continue to raise their concerns if he felt they were not being attended to properly.\n\nBefore the Minister-President could offer a rejoinder, the Kaiser dismissed him, much as a schoolmaster might a truculant student, despite the Minister-President's seniority in their respective ages. Minister-President Dollfuß retired to his offices, a sour look twisting his lips and brow as he went."
krg_dnf.124.a: "The rumour mill has already picked up on this."

krg_dnf.125.t: "Dollfuß Resigns His Seat"
krg_dnf.125.d: "Despite his disasterous premiership and resignation from the role of Minister-President and CSP-OKgFP chairman after the vote of no-confidence in his leadership, Engelbert Dollfuß had still not quit the Federal Diet. Perhaps he hoped that his error and contrition would be considered enough and that he could be a repentant failure whilst retaining his role. However that was not to be. \n\nWhilst it was initially thought there would be a need to apply pressure to the CSP-OKgFP, it appears that they have no desire to be associated with his brand of failure either. Foreign Minister Leopold Figl has taken the leadership of the Falken wing of the party from Dollfuß and with that final iniquity Dollfuß apparently felt that there was no further point in remaining in parliament. His seat will remain empty until the next Federal election, abstaining from all votes."
krg_dnf.125.a: "Icarus, he flew too close to the sun, burned his wings and fell to the earth."

krg_dnf.126.t: "The 21 Days Conspiracy"
krg_dnf.126.d: "Continuous rumours swirl about our coalition partners and the plans of the Dollfuß government to return to Austria-Hungary and the Germanisation and Magyarisation policy. Whilst no legitimate documents have come to the surface, a number of fakes and some sketchy looking 'copies' of originals have come to light and have been examined by experts who have debunked their authenticity. Unfortunately, whilst the truth is tying its laces, a lie can run around the world. We have the benefit of being able to come in as a new leadership and denounce the previous government, but we have to remember we are still in coalition with the CSP. Ultimately, some people will always believe the worst of the government, no matter who is in charge."
krg_dnf.126.a: "Let an inquiry commission look into it, and report in time."
krg_dnf.126.b: "Strenuously deny it immediately, regardless of how it looks."
krg_dnf.126.c: "Paint the CSP as villains of the piece."

krg_dnf_news.12.d: "Bereitschaftsübung Ost is a joint strategic exercise by the Danubian and Ukrainian armed forces, which has been in the planning stages for some time. With current events it would seem that the Danubian government has brought the operation forward and escalated patrols as well as interdiction and airspace activities. The exercise will be in the format of preparing to repel Russian incursions into the Ukraine. It will take place along the border with the Western Military District of Russia.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian official statements, the exercise will involve a total of 12,700 Danubian and Ukrainian military personnel, 570 armoured vehicles, 550 artillery units, and over 170 aircraft. According to the Russian State, the last exercise involved 75,000 military personnel, six times higher than Danubian Federation sources disclosed. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has no evidence to support these claims, but given the recent events around the No Confidence Vote, it could be seen the Danubian government is seeking to have the people rally around the flag."

krg_dnf.128.t: "Rolling out State Development Loans"
krg_dnf.128.d: "The Von Mises Commission has done some very good work, but we feel that their conditions are perhaps too stringent. The state can promote further development and take a longer view of things than some of the banks that the Von Mises Commission recommend to their candidates once their angel-investments are finished. \n\nBy adding a second tier of State support for enterprises initially launched by the Von Mises Commission we are able to ensure that enterprises who may not reach immediate profitability after their first round of funding, but show promise, can continue so they reach their profit point, rather than wasting funds on ventures that fail after the money dries up. It should also discourage fund-seeking rentier behaviour by providing a requirement for progress over time for additional rounds of funding, rather than turning up with a good idea and vanishing to the hills when the fund gets paid out."
krg_dnf.128.a: "Danubia will profit by promoting enterprise and innovation further."

krg_dnf.129.t: "Finding the CSP pragmatists and convincing them"
krg_dnf.129.d: "The simplest way to pass bills is to have a guaranteed number of votes. Any child can tell you that. The problem is we are technically a minority government in that our allies in the Balaton Bloc hold the majority of our seats. Calling an early election without moving our agenda forward is out of the question, but at the same time without the support of the CSP we cannot reliably pass measures in the Federal diet.\n\n Thus we need to convince them. Fortunately there are a decent number of pragmatists who are looking to continue repairing the damage of the Dollfuß government, and if we sway them, we might be capable of continuing our plans. It will cost some energy and we will have to pay lipservice to some of their ideals, but after the last few months they are more than willing to return the favour... and by that we will slowly draw blood from the stone their represents to our plans."
krg_dnf.129.a: "Time, patience, and strategic compromise."

krg_dnf.130.t: "Educating the Regional Diets"
krg_dnf.130.d: "If we are to introduce the Personal Prinzip we must ensure that our politicians in the regions understand it. That they can explain it, argue for it, fight counter arguments against it and that they can debate it in a watertight manner.\n\nMessing with the fabric of the nation is not undertaken lightly but this is a structural reform that Minister-President Renner has been working on for almost as long as he has been in politics. His understanding of our nation is coloured by this idea and our regional leaders must be able to persuade their opponents that even in the event they disagree with it's implementation or specifics, that the grand idea has it's own merit. We are going to change the course of history with this reform. It must be understood from the lowest activist in the most remote region, all the way to the Minister-President in Wien. The intermediate step between that remote yokel and the master of Danubia's fate is the Regional Diet member in his crownland seat. He or she must understand exactly how their nation within the state will be affected by it, how their nationality will stand to benefit, and how representation of those who live alongside them but have none, is not a loss, but a gain for themselves and their neighbours."
krg_dnf.130.a: "Lofty goals, let us change the river's flow."

krg_dnf.131.t: "Reevaluating the Balaton Agreements"
krg_dnf.131.d: "The basis of the Staatsrecht principle and the foundational documents of the modern Danubian federation, the Balaton Agreements were a compromise measure, one that was designed to be reassessed. Much like the Constitution of the defunct United States, some have already decided it is inviolable as holy writ and can bear no modification, despite several of the authors still being alive today.\n\nThe Balaton Agreements were the most that all sides could agree to. Unfortunately for Minister President Renner, he had to agree to something that was less than ideal. The clock is ticking and the old man is acutely aware that he does not have forever to convince people, and that the longer he lets them rest untouched, the more mythical their status will become. He has therefore been involved in a number of meetings, committees and cross-party talks to secure agreement for reassessment of Balaton at some point in the near future, by all groups in the Federal Diet, excluding the petty nationalists. Their exclusion, and the potential uncertainty, has some side effects however."
krg_dnf.131.a: "Tensions rise, tensions fall. All things in good time."

krg_dnf.132.t: "Strengthening State Institutions"
krg_dnf.132.d: "The Staatsrecht has always meant that to some degree there is a level of dual governance in Danubia, that the Federal government is not equipped to handle certain things or has devolved responsibility for them entirely to the Nations. As time has gone on, it has become painfully clear that some things which were devolved should not have been.\n\nThe planned changes to the state along the Personal Prinzip therefore requires a strengthened Federal state that will be able to take over and fill in the gaps that have been left by the recession of the national governments. The Federal government has to prepare it's institutions to be decentralised and diverse, able to act dynamically as required to fulfil the needs of Danubia."
krg_dnf.132.a: "Today we start a new process."

krg_dnf.133.t: "Dealing with the Hardliners"
krg_dnf.133.d: "The CSP have mostly come around to our way of thinking, the broadest swathe of society and the political classes both in Wien and the Nations within the State also. But there are still some diehards who persist in pure obstructionism, who refuse to listen to the voice of reason or to at least, quietly go with the flow and plot our demise quietly in private whilst demurring to our faces.\n\nWe must decide what to do with them, whether we should try and find a way to get rid of them, or if we should just ignore them on the cusp of our victory."

krg_dnf.134.d: "HOW ARE YOU READING THIS KARL RENNER IS DEAD, YOU CAN'T HAVE PERSONAL PRINZIP NOW\n\nAs the clock struck the hour in Wien, Minister-President Renner laid his pen to the paper and signed the document. The bill was the conclusion of a life's successful work. He paused and smiled for the cameras in attendance, let the flashbulb wreck his eyes and tried not to blink as several others started a cascade of flashes. He lowered his head and then placed his hands on the desk, getting to his feet slowly. He looked to the group in attendance and let his smile grow a bit before speaking.\n\n'Das Leben gilt nichts, wo die Freiheit fällt.'\n\nThey turned out to be his last words."

krg_dnf.135.d: "In order to unify support for the idea among the people they must understand how their lives are about to change. More than that, they must understand the benefits of that change so they can understand their lives are going to be improved, not by some uncaring and remote government body but in a meaningful and substantive manner.\n\nTherefore today the Federal government, with co-ordination within newly setup offices and bureaus of the Regional governments, has announced the roll out of a nationwide campaign explaining in every language what this change means, how it will be implemented and what a bright future the people of Danubia can look forward to. We can only hope we reach every single person, but the campaign has bought advertisements in every newspaper of note, dedicated telephone exchanges have been setup for those who may have questions and there is even a slot explaining the situation being broadcast on the television networks."

krg_dnf.136.d: "The German Empire has cordially offered an invitation to Mitteleuropa to Danubia on very good terms. The offer is not time limited, and it would be something that any Danubian government would not be against in principle. Some grumble and mutter about tying our successful economy to the fate of the German economic bloc, whilst others point out that our largest trading partner is Mitteleuropa already and it makes sense to be inside the room when the rules are being made."

krg_dnf.160.d: "Hrado (from the Czech 'hrát dobré') is the invention of Danish immigrant Ole Kjeld Kristiansen, who set up shop in Bohemia during the Second Weltkrieg. A toymaker by trade, due to political instability in Denmark, he emigrated and left behind his workshop and wooden toys, most of which perished in a mysterious fire a short time later.\n\nDespite the adversity, Kristiansen had in his possession a number of MICB's  (Mosley Interlocking Construction Blocks) sent to him from a friend in London a few years earlier. With the fall of the Union of Britain, and the coincidental death of their inventor (a Hillary Page), Kristiansen took out a loan and started a small plastic mouldings factory. He soon mastered the creation of the product that he labelled 'Hrado'.\n\nSince then the product has been something of a sleeper hit, slowly growing in more and more popularity as it is shared amongst children and his business extends it's marketing reach.\n\nHrado recently opened a new factory in Kladnó as well as a facility in Nyíregyháza. It seems like it will soon be one of Danubia's famous exports."

krg_dnf.200.t: "The Lessons of the Second Weltkrieg"
krg_dnf.200.d: "The Gemeinsame Armee managed, over the course of the Second Weltkrieg to conduct itself admirably despite the many handicaps faced by a multinational army of conscripts. The unification of the command structure under the adhoc aegis of the Armee Oberkommando, the integration of the former k.k. Estate Guards units as well as the ongoing process with the normalisation of the Landwehr and Honved ranks into the Gemeinsame command structure means that Danubia fought the war with possibly the most centralised and organised force since Austria expanded beyond the borders of German speaking lands. \n\nPart of this was a radical shift in the development of military strategic thinking after the torturous grind of the first Weltkrieg applied pressure to Austria-Hungary such that at points there were real concerns it would not survive a second one. Thus when the chance to do so was given, the school of 'Manöverkrieg' took root in the Generalstab. The motorisation and mechanisation of Danubia's armed forces was furthered during the period before the Federation joined the Second Weltkrieg, despite the slightly hurried entrance due to the Russian gains on the Eastern Front.\n\nAdditionally it must be recalled that the Balaton Principles had assured that the central military would not be considered a truly viable tool for internal policing, which meant that the army was able to develop in new directions from it's previous role. Divisions still deployed to areas where the soldiers were not local, but this was more to do with the extent of the borders and the necessity of conducting modern weltkrieg. Further development and codification of the 'Army-Slavic' language, as well as additional training in Hungarian and German for all conscripts reduced some of the linguistic dissonance and reduced reliance on regimental languages.\n\nUltimately, the Gemeinsame Armee finished the war at the peak of its strength, as an army that despite the to and fro of the war in the East, and the fierce blooding of its forces in Italy, had come into its full strength as an organisation. These gains must be preserved, for Danubia's sake."
krg_dnf.200.a: "We must make sure that we carry forward success."

krg_dnf.201.t: "Formalising the Armeeoberkommando"
krg_dnf.201.d: "The Armeeoberkommando was originally an adhoc organisation first created in the First Weltkrieg. Since then it was dissolved, and then reformed three months prior to the entry of the Danubian Federation. With the changes to the Gemeinsame Armee and the reduction of duplication within the force structure, the institutionalisation of this adhoc grouping is now within the grasp of the Federal War Ministry. \n\nEmulating the General Staff structure of the Germans and having a permanently constituted consultancy of military minds also allows us to maintain the armed forces at a higher state of readiness than they have been held to previously. With the present economic situation, there is even space in the budget for a wargames to test through some of the proposed chances to operational practises.\n\nThe Armeeoberkommando has to come to a decision however: What will the first wargames be about?"
krg_dnf.201.a: "Prepare the wargames for an operation against Russia"

krg_dnf.202.t: "Fall Weiss"
krg_dnf.202.d: "The Armeeoberkommando, having decided on the 'Fall Weiss' plan against Russia, has put together a wargame operation to take place on the military testing grounds on the Carpathian plain. The plan will have several Hungarian speaking divisions as the opposing force, and will centre on an armoured spearhead attempting to breakthrough across the Danube, representing a crossing action on the Dnieper which would be the likely opening move of any offensive war by the Reichspakt against Russia.\n\nThe essential plan is to gain air superiority over the river, then have several mechanised and armoured divisions crossing via pontoon bridges before pocketing and splitting the opposing forces against the river and our holding divisions."
krg_dnf.202.a: "Excellent. Let's hope it all goes well."

krg_dnf.203.t: "Fall Rot"
krg_dnf.203.d: "The Armeeoberkommando, having decided on the 'Fall Rot' plan with an opposing force in the hilly terrain of Italy or Balkans, has put together a wargame operation to take place on government owned land in the Illyrian crownland. The plan will emphasise the use of the Army-Slavic language across the chain of command and use a mix of divisions from across Danubia. The opposing forces will be supported by the Illyrian Landsturm and will include both Italian and Illyrian troops.\n\nThe essential plan of the exercise is to simulate a combined arms operation, including marine landings supported by naval bombardment and advancing through hilly terrain with close air support."
krg_dnf.203.a: "Excellent. Let's hope it all goes well."

krg_dnf.204.t: "Fall Blau"
krg_dnf.204.d: "The Armeeoberkommando, having decided on the 'Fall Blau' plan defensive exercise, has put together a wargame operation to take place on government owned land in the Bohemian crownland, specifically in the terrain of the Moravian Karst. The plan will have several German speaking mechanised and armour divisions attempting to punch a breakthrough against entrenched defenses including Gebirgsjagerkorps troops as well as motorised and mechanised infantry and panzer divisions on the current configuration.\n\nThe essential plan of the exercise is to evaluate Danubia's strength against observed 'Manöverkrieg' in the German style. The optics of the exercise are certainly interesting, but it is not considered a concern at this time. What is more of interest is how well the Gemeinsame Armee will hold up."
krg_dnf.204.a: "It's just an exercise!"

krg_dnf.205.t: "Wargames Results"
krg_dnf.205.d: "The past few days saw the playing out of the wargame that was decided on two months ago. The results and conclusions from the events were very interesting and have provided the Armeeoberkommando with a lot of new data to evaluate and play out at the tabletop level. Of note: \nDivisions using the Army-Slavic language were able to communicate and react to opposing forces without some of the linguistic issues that have previously plagued larger operations.\nAir Superiority was easily wrested from propeller planes by the jet-fighters.\nSpecial forces troops and panzer troops both represent some of the most well equipped and professional units in our army.\nSeveral key assumptions on the behaviour of the opposing force from historical battlefield observation proved to be situationally logical.\n\nThe details of this exercise can be found in full in the Federal War Ministry Archive."
krg_dnf.205.a: "Good to know. Seems the AOK will be busy for awhile yet."

krg_dnf.206.t: "The Realities of Demobilisation"
krg_dnf.206.d: "Since the peace seems set to last for some time and the morale of the conscript recruit has begun to wane, it has become obvious that at least a partial demobilisation will take place regardless of our readiness stance against Russia. Even if the political will exists, there are personnel within the army who would be more productive in society.\n\nDemobilisation offices across Danubia are providing our soldiers with suitable civilian clothing to allow them to pursue opportunities in the general work force, as well as technical certifications where applicable. No doubt there will be those who will not fit in, and will gravitate back to the armed forces, but we must do our best to provide them with a decent chance in the wider world.\n\nFor those soldiers who have stayed behind, and the officer corps, there will have to be a change in operational behaviour. Priorities must be reassessed, and plans must be made knowing that the expedient requirement of 'there's a war on' can no longer force a rush order or divert a shipment."
krg_dnf.206.a: "This will help to relieve the stress on the economy."

krg_dnf.207.t: "Modernised Command and Control Centre"
krg_dnf.207.d: "Historically being an ad hoc organisation called into existence when a war requires it, the Armee Oberkommando has had to make its existence in spaces unwanted by other organisations in the state apparatus. Now that it is formally present and superceding several preceding organisations it is only fitting that it has it's own purpose built space. Such a space has now been completed, and from the outskirts of Wien, the Gemeinsame Armee and indeed the entire Danubian armed forces have a truly modern command centre that will allow our general staff to control and communicate with increased efficiency and clarity to our troops on the frontlines."
krg_dnf.207.a: "This looks... good!"

krg_dnf.208.t: "Changing of the Guard"
krg_dnf.208.d: "The Armed Forces has several fieldmarshals, generals and leaders of other rank who have been in their positions since the end of the First Weltkrieg. Whilst some have decided to take their retirement of their own accord, others seem to believe it is their job to remain in the services, complain about the changes we are making and lower morale in general. After some political maneuvering and the recent demobilisation, we are now in a position to kindly request that they take their leave of the Army and enjoy their retirement.\n\nPromoting some new blood will also reinvigorate the strategic discussions in the halls of the Armeeoberkommando, which can only lead to new adaptive strategy and tactics."
krg_dnf.208.a: "Goodbye gentlemen!"

krg_dnf.209.t: "Convening the War Performance Commission"
krg_dnf.209.d: "The Armeeoberkommando has with the consent of the War Ministry and the Finance Ministry convened a War Performace Commission to review the performance of the Aerial arm of the Army and Navy over the period of the Danubian intervention in the Second Weltkrieg. The purpose of this assessment is to conclude if the aerial arm should remain, just that, or if as some have advocated for within the Army and Navy, become it's own service.\n\nThe topic is one of great interest, with some Generals content to allow their aerial adjutants to take full control of their airwing past target orders, and others fascinated by the co-ordination of air and land in their own spheres. Thus there is a debate in the service which needs to be gone over, on the basis of facts and figures.\n\nThere is a room for anecdotal evidence as well, but there are strong opinions around this topic, which means that it may come down to review of various fronts, how the generals handled their airwings and their comparative successes and failures."
krg_dnf.209.a: "Insights no doubt will abound."

krg_dnf.210.t: "The Tedious Work of Conclusion"
krg_dnf.210.d: "The dry shuffling of paper and the low discussions of various adjutants, lieutenants, captains and even the occasional major were a constant underlying buzz. Field Marshal Alfred Jansa pinched the bridge of his nose, sliding up his reading glasses to do so for a moment and then reached out to pick up yet another report. Sector 7G. A rather unremarkable square of airspace over the Dniepr north of Dnipropetrovsk. Airwing there scored 650 kills in a four month period of operations under Armeegruppe Ukrainien, those figures accelerating when the Me262 was deployed with fighter aces 'Sokol' Dukovac and 'Nowi' Novotny.\n\nIt seemed patently clear to Jansa that the only decisive winner seemed to be jet-fighter. Regardless of who won this tussle, those would have to be in the future of the Danubia. That he was certain of. He removed his reading glasses and picked up a glass of brandy. He raised it and sniffed at the contents absentmindedly then took a swig and placed the bohemian crystal back down on the slightly scuffed sage green leather of his desk in the reading room of the Armeeoberkommando.\n\nHe looked up, and wondered if there was to be some kind of sign as to the decision to be made, or if he would have to wait for the counts of every bullet used in the course of the Second Weltkrieg by a fighter plane to cross his desk. He glanced out of the window for a moment, letting his gaze linger on the overcast sky. As it returned to the room..."

krg_dnf.211.d: "After an exhaustive period of determination and analysis the conclusions of the War Performance Commission have been published by the Armeeoberkommando and forwarded to the Cabinet as well as the Finance and War Ministries. It is determined at this time that the Danubian aerial forces, whilst serving adequately throughout the course of the Second Weltkrieg, showed no marked performance difference under more autonomous or direct army command. As such there is seen no need to disturb the ship of state about its present course, and the aerial forces will remain subordinate to the Army (and Navy) where appropriate.\n\nThe document has come under fire from some quarters as being insufficiently forward thinking as to the vaunted 'winning the next war' goal of the Armeeoberkommando, but it appears that for the time being, there is no room for further discussion on the matter. Oberst Alexander Löhr has gone on record stating that he believes the Commission did not consider all the available evidence, but it is well known he was an advocate for an independent service."
krg_dnf.211.a: "There will be plenty of uses for airwings no doubt."

krg_dnf.212.d: "After an exhaustive period of determination and analysis the conclusions of the War Performance Commission have been published by the Armeeoberkommando and forwarded to the Cabinet as well as the Finance and War Ministries. It is determined at this time that the Danubian aerial forces, having served adequately throughout the course of the Second Weltkrieg, had a decisive performance difference under more autonomous command. As such there is a General Directive for the aerodromes to become part of an independent Danubian Airforce. Additionally the Fallschirmjäger 'Falken' division will be under Airforce control.Finally, Oberst Alexander Löhr, for his initiative and bringing of crucial evidence to light in the sea of available data has been named the first Danubian Airforce Commander. Due to the institution being created from whole cloth there is as yet, no clear rank for him to be promoted to. That will no doubt be resolved in time.\n\nThe document has been praised in several different circles, as forward thinking and planning to meet the 'winning the next war' goal of the Armeeoberkommando, and it seems that the Airforce will be the darling of the services, at least for a short time."
krg_dnf.212.a: "Löhr must be pleased."

krg_dnf.213.t: "Development of Combined Arms Strategy"
krg_dnf.213.d: "With the air forces working in concert with the army, the Armeeoberkommando has formed a special board in order to develop and expand the doctrine of Combined Arms with specific focus on using close air support. By ensuring that communication between the air wing and the troops on the ground is clear and co-ordinated to the utmost degree, we will be able to get troops out of trouble in mere moments with our fast-moving jet strike craft.\n\nThe organisational plan for the assignment of airwings is at the army group level, with the document providing plans for the deployment of airborne 'cavalry' divisions for infantry in conjunction with jet-powered aerial superiority over the battlefield. This aligns neatly with 'winning the next war' that has taken the military establishment by storm lately. We are putting forth a tender for design and development of the next generation of aerial vehicle for the Army-Air Wing, and we expect strong industry response."
krg_dnf.213.a: "No doubt there will be a serious bid for these tenders."

krg_dnf.214.t: "Building the Institution of a New Service"
krg_dnf.214.d: "Marschall der Kaiserlichen Luftwaffe,  Alexander Löhr has taken the role of developing the institutions the new service with gusto. Between developing a new ranking structure, processing the transfers of pilots from the Army and Navy to the new service and moving into the development of the future of the new aerial menace for our opponents. Obviously the strategic requirements of our forces will involve jetfighter aircraft however there is also development of bomber and missile technologies, both of which advanced in the Second Weltkrieg.\n\nThe organisational plan for the development of bomber craft and missile technology, originates with the new Luftwaffe and there are plans for a technical development of the assets of the new service in order to make them the truly determining force of Danubian might. This aligns neatly with 'winning the next war' that has taken the military establishment by storm lately. We are putting forth a tender for design and development of the next generation of aerial bomber and missile weapons for the Luftwaffe, and we expect strong industry response."
krg_dnf.214.a: "No doubt there will be a serious bid for these tenders."

krg_dnf.215.t: "Thunder over the Steppe"
krg_dnf.215.d: "Oberleutnant Walter 'Nowi' Novotny sat in his Avia 262 and felt the stick shaking in his hand as he brought the plane into a dive. Sector patrol since the ceasefire in the Ukraine had reduced him to flying acrobatics out of boredom. Still, he felt the speed of the Avia as he pulled out of the dive and started to ascend once more, the jet engines straining against the very bounds of gravity itself with a joyous disinterest in obeying them. His lungs filled with air from the cabin for a moment and he squinted into the midday sun, then averted his gaze into the blue sky.\n\nThen Nowi looked to the East and saw the stormclouds piling up there, across the Dnieper. He estimated they would be upon him within thirty minutes, and considered turning back for a moment. Nowi knew the official policy was to return to base, but he had a feeling that the stormclouds were just as bad news for the Russians as they were for him. And he wasn't afraid of any of those propeller-driven relics they flew anyway. He reached for the radio.\n\n'I've seen something on the Dniepr. Going to investigate.'\nHe banked toward the storm, and let out the throttle, crossing into Russian airspace as the thick grey clouds enveloped him. The plane shook and rattled as he spoke to it softly, a smile playing over his lips. He hadn't been lying, he had seen something. It turned out to be a pair of Yak-3 prop fighters flying sector patrol. He had them outmatched, and they were already descending to get out of the bad weather. He didn't think they'd even spotted him - the dark grey of the Avia blending nicely with the storm clouds as he settled on their tails. He had to slow down if didn't want to overshoot them.\n\nNowi lined up his gunsight on the rear Yak, then flipped the cover off his fire control. He held his breath and everything around him faded for a moment except for the Yak ahead of him. He held someone's life in his hands..."
krg_dnf.215.a: "He squeezed the trigger."
krg_dnf.215.b: "He let out the throttle and buzzed over them."

krg_dnf.216.t: "Incident over the Dnieper"
krg_dnf.216.d: "The autocannon ripped into the Yak and blew it to pieces, and Nowi looked to the other Yak as the first one went down. He had, he guessed a second before the radio would shriek with the Russian's guttural language. There was little time. He brought the Avia around, then fired at the second plane as his gunsight moved across it. Then he banked sharply and let out the throttle, trusting on his plane's superior acceleration to get him away from the Russians before they could even react.\n\nHe looked over his shoulder as he retreated, and noticed a pair of parachutes had blossomed in the sky where there had been two planes. Nowi realised he'd been lucky, but as he returned to the Aerodrome he cursed himself and his impulse. No doubt there would be questions asked about this. He would have to explain himself. He picked up his radio and started to talk... \n\n==STRENG GEHEIM==\n\nReport on Russian Aggression over Dniepr, sector 6R\n Oberleutnant Walter Novotny (callsign 'Nowi') was set upon by two Russian Yak-3's during stormy weather. He had gone to investigate a possible intrusion of airspace over Reichspakt Ukraine by the Russians. Their claim that he was interdicting their aircraft is unverifiable due to conditions in the sector at the time. Whatever the exact circumstances, Novotny performed admirably, downing both Yaks without damage to his own craft. Recommend formal repudiation of Russian complaints as unwarranted interference and advise them to stay within their own airspace, additionally a commendation for Oberleutnant Novotny." 
krg_dnf.216.a: "Russian aggression must remain checked."

krg_dnf.217.t: "Incident over the Dnieper"
krg_dnf.217.d: "Nowi let out the throttle and zoomed over the Russians before squeezing the trigger and sending a spray of autocannon fire and tracers into the wind, to demonstrate to them just how he'd been able to put them out of their misery. He chuckled as his radio burst into life, Russian swearwords filling the air as the Yak's split and tried to pursue him as they already became rapidly shrinking blobs to his rear. He banked around and headed back to the aerodrome, a smile on his lips as he leaned into his radio and started to talk.\n\nHe noticed as he did so the Yaks had broken their pursuit, no doubt recognising that they were not going to catch him without going deep into Reichspakt airspace. It seemed to Nowi, that the Danubian Eagle ruled these skies for the time being.\n\n==STRENG GEHEIM==\n\nReport on Russian Aggression over Dniepr, sector 6R\n Oberleutnant Walter Novotny (callsign 'Nowi') was set upon by two Russian Yak-3's during stormy weather. He had gone to investigate a possible intrusion of airspace over Reichspakt Ukraine by the Russians.\n\nDemonstration of our superior aircombat technologies was enough to dissuade the Russian intrusion after he fired a warning shot and demonstrated the ease in which he had been able to get them into a position whereby they could have been destroyed."
krg_dnf.217.a: "Russian aggression must remain checked."

krg_dnf.218.t: "The Great Mothballing"
krg_dnf.218.d: "The fleet has always been the junior service in Danubia. There simply has always been too much to take care of on the nations borders, plus the fact that the Adriatic is practically a sea within a sea, isolate from the rest of the world. That has meant that the fleet has had to take a second place to the army, and it has had to take what was left. Unfortunately, with the peace that also means the navy will have to downsize to go forward into the next era. However, that downsizing is not due to poor economic conditions, for once in it's history. Rather, the time has come to retire our older vessels and instead look forward to a new era of development in naval tactics and craft.\n\nAs the axe hangs above the fleet, and names are selected to send to the scrappers, or abroad, the only question that remains is how deep will it cut? How many esteemed warships will sail no more? Or under the flag of another state perhaps?"
krg_dnf.218.a: "We can still find a use for most. Scrap the oldest."
krg_dnf.218.b: "Nothing but the newest must remain. We must look forward."
krg_dnf.218.c: "Sell the Reserve Fleet to the Ukraine."

krg_dnf.219.t: "The Wind Rises"
krg_dnf.219.d: "'Nothing can stop the attack of aircraft except other aircraft. Therefore we should design our fleet to oppose the threat from the sky first.'\n\nOnce we control the skies we can prosecute our campaign against the enemy's shipping or even interdict land-based forces. The sea is merely a venue in which the battle for the skies is fought, and therefore aircraft carriers should be our focus - that we might have the freshest of pilots flying their jets against our foes and bombing them. The development of jet engines have changed the entire paradigm of combat, and we should be wise to respect that."
krg_dnf.219.a: "The skies will bring us the seas."

krg_dnf.220.t: "The Grand Old Man's Plan"
krg_dnf.220.d: "'A ship at sea is its own world. To be the captain of a ship is to be the unquestioned ruler of that world and requires all of the leadership skills of a prince or minister.'\n\nThat was something Miklas Horthy knew well, and it is written deeply into the blood of his plan. He was a navy man through and through, and his design for the navy reflects on the reality of our situation - the shallow Adriatic and beyond Otranto, the Mediterranean. We do not have a shoreline with some vast ocean, and our fleet should reflect that, much like the Venetians crewed galleys whilst the Dutch sailed barques. Our vessels will be well-armed, numerous, and just as capable of deterring our foes as the great gun platforms of old."
krg_dnf.220.a: "The age of the battleship is over."

krg_dnf.221.t: "The Enveloping Depths"
krg_dnf.221.d: "'Like the destroyer, the submarine has created its own type of officer and man with language and traditions apart from the rest of the service, and yet at the heart unchangingly of the Service.'\n\nOnce out of the shallows of the Adriatic, the submarine becomes a truely fearsome foe. Difficult to detect, capable of hitting the opponent and then vanishing as the foe falls into a mire of distress and confusion, having not even known of their approach. Even the mere threat of submarine activity can force the enemy into gathering his forces, delaying his shipments and creating juicer targets for massed submarine wolf-packs. Just as we saw in the Second Weltkrieg, an adept submarine force can keep even the toughest battleship task-force bottled up in port."
krg_dnf.221.a: "Let them fear the depths."

krg_dnf.222.t: "Completing Force Reintegration"
krg_dnf.222.d: "After hard work and many long nights, the final shape of the armed forces has been defined. The Gemeinsame Armee and the air and naval forces have been drilled and shaped. The commanders know their roles and responsiblities. The Army Slavic language has finally reached fruition and the broad mass of the troops comprehend it enough to respond appropriately.\n\nThe Army has long been an un-cooperative creature, due to the constraints placed upon it. Now we are finally overcoming them.\n\nHaving forged it into the shape we require, we can now look to developing doctrine further. We are preparing once more to fight the next war, the war of the atomic age."
krg_dnf.222.a: "Excellent."

krg_dnf.223.t: "A Prudent Decision"
krg_dnf.223.d: "Alexander Löhr had been busy examining the budget assigned to him. It had become obvious that the price of aircraft and continuing research and development was not going to be cheap. A fighter air arm to defend the national airspace was obvious, and experience from the war proved that bombers were needed...\n\nHis pen hovered over the predictions for missile technologies. Promising, yes, but still in their infancy. Worse yet, a missile was fired once and destroyed, unlike a bomber. And missiles were not cheap either. Not yet anyway.\n\nHe let out a sigh. He would not be able to get another krone out of the Federal Budget. He scratched out the missile development program in red ink."
krg_dnf.223.a: "Not now."

krg_dnf.224.d: "Alexander Löhr had been busy examining the budget assigned to him. It had become obvious that the price of aircraft and continuing research and development was not going to be cheap. A fighter air arm to defend the national airspace was obvious.\n\nHis pen hovered over the predictions for missile technologies. Promising, yes, but still in their infancy. Worse yet, a missile was fired once and destroyed. And they were not cheap either.\n\nBut... a missile would be cheaper than a bomber one day... with sufficient fuel it could reach further... and unlike a bomber, it did not hang around above enemy airspace, risking the lives of skilled airmen.\n\nThe pen skittered over the bomber programme and knocked off a few zeroes."
krg_dnf.224.a: "Money is replaceable. Blood spent should be the enemy's."

krg_dnf.225.t: "Flak Probabilities"
krg_dnf.225.d: "Bombers flying at higher altitudes require larger guns and shells to reach them. This greatly increased the cost of the system, and slowed the rate of fire. Faster aircraft fly out of range more quickly, reducing the number of rounds fired against them. Against late-war designs and jet-powered designs, flak was becoming essentially useless. The solution therefore is a Surface to Air missile that can be launched against our opponent's bombers and reach them at the altitude they are operating at. One that can track and strike them out of the sky, rather than requiring endless rounds of flak with a trifling probability of finishing the enemy bomber off.\n\nAnd then they need to be deployed en masse."
krg_dnf.225.a: "Indeed"

krg_dnf.226.t: "The Delicate Sound of Thunder"
krg_dnf.226.d: "They stood on the runway and watched as the Avia-Aero Vodochody 'AS-007' taxied down the runway. The new plane was a prototype of the design team under Jaromir Astl who stood there in a smart shirt, a few steps left of Alexander Löhr. The Oberst lowered his sunglasses a moment and watched the heat shimmer on the tarmac behind the jet.\n\nThe runway itself was shorter than those used for jets normally, but Astl stood there with a calm nonchalance. Löhr wasn't surprised - the man had probably already tested it beforehand. Still as ace pilot Karl 'Charlie' Gratz let out the throttle the jet engine's newly familiar whine was replaced with a thundering roar. The jet started down the runway, gaining speed incredibly fast.\n\n Löhr couldn't help himself, and looked over to the engineer, yelling over the roaring plane as it broke into the sky like a bird taking flight.\n"What did you call this new engine again?!".\n\n Astl turned to him with a half smile, and spoke in Bohemian accented German."
krg_dnf.226.a: "An Afterburner."

krg_dnf.227.d: "In a ceremony that was attended by practically the entire citizenry of Wien plus many international notables, that brought the world metropolis grinding to a halt and filled the air with the ringing of bells across the entirety of Danubia. His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, Kaiser Otto, first of his name, of the House of Habsburg-Lothringen was wedded today in a Roman Catholic service at the Augustinian Church in Wien, to his bride Regina, a Princess of Saxe-Meiningen in Germany. \n\nOtto's brothers, Archduke Robert and Archduke Felix were the witnesses at the religious service. Princess Regina wore a diamond tiara on her head that had been worn before by the Emperor's mother, Empress Zita. She was escorted down the aisle by her father, Duke Georg of Saxe-Meiningen. The new Empress and Queen is the daughter of the aforementioned and Countess Klara Marie von Korff genannt Schmissing-Kerssenbrock.\n\nPope Pius XII's Apostolic Blessing to the newlyweds was read at the religious service.  "To our dear son, Emperor and King Otto of Habsburg-Lorraine.  The awaited day will soon shine on the ceremony in which your will be joined with the Princess Regina of Saxony-Meiningen.

## Illyria Modernisation Events ##

krg_dnf.400.t: "Von Mises Commission Delegation heads to Illyria"
krg_dnf.400.d: "Several members of the Von Mises Commission for Economic Development have been invited to Illyria at the behest of the new SDAPD/I government there. The region has long suffered from high unemployment, lack of opportunities and a general backwardness. It is hoped that a federal intervention and some key capital investments into the region will allow the market to develop the means to help bring Illyria forward into the Atomic Age, as well as quench any fires of dissatisfaction amongst the populace there as the nation gets an economic shot in the arm.\n\nThe local government has several ideas they would like help funding, which were part of their electoral promises. However the Von Mises Commission has given the delegation a free hand as to the assignment of funds. Ultimately where they will disburse them could have consquences beyond a few construction projects." 
krg_dnf.400.a: "No small task lies ahead for the delegates."

krg_dnf.401.t: "Expansion of Brodogradilište-Split complete!" 
krg_dnf.401.d: "After several months the expansion of the dockyards adjoining the naval base at Split has been completed. The new expansion will allow faster production of naval craft in Split, as well as providing jobs for over 1000 people.\n\nIllyrian Minister of Finance, Edvard Kardelj was present at the opening of the site and spoke somewhat succinctly about the opportunities this provided for young men and women interested in the fabrication trade. The conclusion of affairs was heralded by a 21 gun salute from the Pride of the Fleet, the 'SMS Habsburg'." 
krg_dnf.401.a: "Excellent!"

krg_dnf.402.t: "Bosnian mines development complete!" 
krg_dnf.402.d: "After several months the development of the extraction of minerals and associated metallurgical processes in Bosnia has shown fruit. Outside a newly opened Bauxite pit mine near Vlasenica, Illyrian Minister of Finance, Edvard Kardelj was present at the opening of the site and spoke enthusiastically and at length about the opportunities this provided for young men and women interested in the development of their nation through their own labour.\n\nAt points in the speech, Kardelj touched upon a concept that the delegates' translators referred to as 'self-management'. He did not however go into extensive detail, mostly focusing on the path to organic national and federal development hinging on self-management and popular consent. The expansion of these mines and the associated industries are expected to employ several thousand people across Bosnia." 
krg_dnf.402.a: "Interesting."

krg_dnf.403.t: "Development at the port of Rijeka!" 
krg_dnf.403.d: "After several months the port of Rijeka was proud to open a new shipping terminus able to handle more ships in general as well as the new larger model of 'container ships' which seem poised to take international shipping by storm.\n\nThe port of Rijeka is of course at the other end of the high-speed rail-link that links the industrial triangle in Bohemia and Silesia, meaning that increased capacity in Rijeka will have knock-on effects for the rest of Danubia with regards to exports of goods and imports of materials from Africa, the Middle East and beyond. Several hundred jobs are expected to be found, though there was some muttering amongst Croat officials that they'd probably all go to the Italian minority in the region." 
krg_dnf.403.a: "For the Federation!"

krg_dnf.404.t: "Banja Luka Metal Factory Opens!" 
krg_dnf.404.d: "With the ribbon being cut by Minister-President Josip Broz himself, the Banja Luka Metal Factory opened in regional capital of Sjeverna Bosna. The modern facility promises to employ over a thousand individuals, and expected output in at least 100,000 tonnes per annum.  \n\nThe facility is a modern one, constructed to high standards and with a 100 ton oxygen based Oberhausen steelmaking converter along with a continuous strip mill and a plate mill. Additionally onsite, there is a new subsidiary 'Škoda-Zbrojovka-Banja Luka' to manufacture infantry equipment under license." 
krg_dnf.404.a: "Fantastic news!"

krg_dnf.405.t: "The Dalmatia Line Opens!" 
krg_dnf.405.d: "Snaking along the coast, this fully electified line has glorious views of the Dalmatian islands to one side, and the stark hills of the coastline on the other.\n\nMore importantly, it is wide enough for two trains to pass without stopping while travelling at high speed. Movement of goods between our naval bases, shipyards and ports in Dubrovnik, Split and Rijeka has never been easier. The delegates from the Von Mises Commission expect that the increased inflows and trade tariffs through these ports before transfer to rail transit should more than make up the expense of the railway to the federal purse." 
krg_dnf.405.a: "Let the trains run on time!"

krg_dnf.406.t: "Infrastructure improvements in Bosnia completed!" 
krg_dnf.406.d: "Teams of laborers have scoured the Bosnian countryside, widening roads, paving trails and laying asphalt over cobbles and bricks. The first leg of a highway from Banja Luka to Mostar was completed, with planned extensions to Sarajevo, Vukovar and Dubrovnik underway. The railway was also electrified, allowing for easier transit of goods into the area, and for economic development in general. \n\nThe roads in Bosnia now resemble something from the 20th century, as opposed to the 16th, this is a cause for celebration, and the ongoing construction work has employed over two thousand youths in productive labour."

krg_dnf.407.t: "The Federal Situation and the Illyrian Position" 
krg_dnf.407.d: " Minister-President Broz submits a short monologue written by Illyrian national chief economist and Finance Minister, Edvard Kardelj. The subject of the monologue is an explanation of the 'self-management' movement. The ideas are quite interesting in and of themselves and will be provided in summary here. \nWorkers elect individuals to the Managing Board \nKey requirements – experience, skills, trust, energy, and political contacts \n–Supervisory Board then part elected by workers and part appointed by Managing Board – as in west, designed to ensure Managing Board is independent and carries out its functions well and to the law \n–Managing Board appoints individual managers (management is a skill, not a controlling function) to plan and undertake work in each unit \n Trade unions exist to protect members from bad managers, but also to provide social services to members.\n\nThere was also a statement to the effect that federal involvement in the direction of Illyrian self-managed development requires re-evaluation and should respect the regional policy of the Illyrian movement."

krg_dnf.408.d: "The Von Mises Commission recieved their report from the delegates today. Unfortunately the commission felt the need to report against Minister-President Broz's involvement for directing funds to projects that were mainly not aligned with federal interests. Whilst not saying it directly, there was attention drawn to the relations between Broz's ministers and the beneficiaries of funds, as well as the structure of some of the recipient business organisations financial practices.\n\nThe report also raised alarm about the radical 'self-management' workplace culture pushed by Broz's pet economist Edvard Kardelj, who claims it is a solution for unemployment and worker satisfaction. The delegates were not impressed, stating that self-management sometimes had a lot of similarity to no-management. They similarly felt that building projects in random villages in Bosnian backcountry was an unproductive use of funds." 
krg_dnf.408.a: "Cut future funding from the federal purse for this corrupt demagogue!"
krg_dnf.408.b: "Bury the report and continue to fund the projects, we want Broz on our side."

krg_dnf.409.t: "Kardelj arrives in Wien." 
krg_dnf.409.d: "After some heel-dragging, Edvard Kardelj arrived in Wien and presented his theory of national, and further worker self-management in the context of the Illyrian situation to the Von Mises Commission. He also promoted the idea that the federal government should add language protecting any self-management system from state interference and expanding representation of nations and provinces in all electoral and policy forums.\n\nKardelj also arranged to meet with members of the SDAPD/O and the federal SDAPD to give a similar presentation, promoting the idea of national self-management as an alternative format to the Staatsrecht principle."

krg_dnf.410.d: "The well-travelled and well-renowned physicist Ede Teller has been one of the recipients of the Donau-Atomforschungsprogramm-Stipendium, and from his lab in Budapest he has reported a breakthrough in the understanding of the physics for the design of a Danubian atomic weapon via an improved process for heavy water production. His co-operation with Stanislaw Ulam, fellow Donau-Atomforschungsprogramm-Stipendium recipient has yielded very interesting results." 
krg_dnf.410.a: "Excellent."

krg_dnf.411.t: "Recruiting Enrico Fermi." 
krg_dnf.411.d: "Nobel Prize winning Physicist Enrico Fermi has been approached about being part of the Donau-Atomforschungsprogramm. His personal concern of a world that has only the German nuclear weapon is one that is unbalanced, as well as the good relations between the Danubian Federation and the Italian Republic led him to consider offering his services to our program, as Italy currently cannot provide the resources for him to continue his studies." 
krg_dnf.411.a: "We will be fools to turn him away. Welcome, Dr. Fermi!"
krg_dnf.411.b: "Danubia has plenty of great minds, we do not need Fermi."

krg_dnf.412.t: "Choosing our Development Strategy" 
krg_dnf.412.d: "While Danubian scientific minds have great ability, there is the unfortunate matter of the Federal Exchequer to contend with. Nuclear weapons are the new colonies, and unlike the last race, we are well positioned to be among the first in the thermonuclear club. The question is therefore how we intend to proceed. At the technical level our physicists and engineers advise that there are two viable strategies to explore.\n\nThe first is what is called a 'foam-plasma' fission-fusion-fission bomb - where a chunk of sub-critical uranium-235 is triggered by a chemical explosive into a supercritical state, triggering fusion via the release of x-rays and then fission of the remaining elements. The second is the that of Ede Teller - a combination fission/fusion 'tamper-pusher' device where a primary fission bomb then triggers nuclear fusion in the secondary 'spark plug' by forcing the fusion fuel toward the supercritical fissile segment.\n\nThe cost assessments for both bombs run into the millions of kronen, but the foam-plasma is considered to be cheaper. It is also considered however, to be the less technical solution, a 'dirtier' bomb due to the last fissile stage - and one that would likely require a complete redesign in future, if we wish to proceed with further development." 
krg_dnf.412.a: "It is enough to own an H-bomb, foam-plasma!"

This quiet place has recently become much noisier, as the Gemeinsame Armee Engineering Corps have taken up residence in great numbers at a location by a great hill near the edge of the village. First they were assembling temporary barracks, and then a yard for construction supplies.\n\nThen the deliveries began. Trucks laden with concrete and steel entered the facility, and trucks laden with dirt left, in great numbers, every day. Then the barracks took on a more permanent look, and the engineers started to lay barbed wire, and signs warning of landmines. \n\nSoon there were more men. And women. And control on the new base was tight, everyone who was there had a photo ID. And they never came down to the village or fraternised. When the people asked their local representatives what was going on, they received advice from Krakow to 'not ask questions, and keep to their own business'. Finally a sign went up in front of the base. 'Bukowsko Special Research Facility. Entrance to Unauthorised Personnel Strictly Forbidden.' "

A strange silence fell after the sirens finished ringing, and then there was only the flat, calm count-down of the technician.\n\nHe held his breath for a moment when it reached zero, then the world shattered in a pane of blinding light, even through the goggles. 'Jesus Wept' he murmured to himself, as the column of fire rose off in the distance, the shockwave washing over the bunker and leaving the distant sound of roaring fire in their ears. General Rendulić lifted his goggles and pinched the bridge of his nose, before looking to Teller. There was no doubting what they had witnessed. Danubia had the 'H-gerät' - the Donau-Atomforschungsprogramm had again achieved success.\n\nOne of the scientists picked up the telephone. The Minister-President would want to know."

Somehow nobody expected it to work, despite all the evidence and logic that it would. Ede Teller quietly murmured to himself 'and Jesus Wept' as the blinding flash had run across his goggles, as it had for all of them inside the room. The shaft was deep, and long, and expelled air out into the countryside a fair distance away, but they had still seen it, and felt that incredible rumble as the earth shook at the force of the explosion.

krg_dnf_federal_elections.0.d: "The last couple of years have seen Minister-President Dollfuß develop a cough that has progressively wracked his small frame with greater and greater spasms. The 40 cigarette a day regime of decades appears to have caught up with the Minister-President, as the physicians at the Hofburg have identified a cancerous mass within his lungs that they believe to be inoperable. \n\nFaced by this news, and struggling to make himself heard on lecturns and podiums for some time now, Minister-President Dollfuss has tendered his resignation, and in what some perceive as a snub to his political ally Leopold Figl, asked Julius Raab to take the chairmanship of the CSP-OKFgP for him."

Observers and journalists from around the world flock to Vienna and Budapest in order to watch the Danubian democracy in action, and perhaps get the inside scoop on who will triumph in the elections in this European titan.\n\nThere are three main factions, the Conservative 'Balaton Bloc' - a federal alliance of Conservative parties from across Danubia who have been the primary movers in the Grand Coalition for most of it's history.\n\nThe SDAPD - the Social Democrat Workers Party of Danubia, who represent the left and have been the junior partner for a long time. It will remain to be seen if losing their long-time leader Karl Renner recently will improve or harm their chances.\n\nFinally in a surprise announcement prior to the elections, the FBLP and the Agrarian parties have announced a 'Liberal Coalition' ticket, with Agrarian leader Péter Veres as the face of their campaign.\n\nHow this will all play out, remains to be seen.

krg_dnf_federal_elections.8.d: "Despite being called the Danubian Federation, our country resembles more the former United States in terms of the division of responsibilities of the various governments.\n\n The SDAPD was the first party to Federalise and believes that a true Federal representation of individuals is both their right and a requirement to truly enable our nation to live up to it's potential.

krg_dnf_federal_elections.10.d: "The logical conclusion of the fact that Danubia is a state with many nations and ethnicities within it, is that there must be powersharing between all the groups and recognition of those groups without reference to territoriality in relation to that recognition. The dissolution of internal crownland borders and the full extension of rights to individuals regardless of their origin or present location, with federal representatives and parties that serve them across the whole of the nation.\n\nDerived from the thought of Karl Renner amongst others, the Personal Princip has been the key plank of SDAPD policy for decades.

Not all at once."

It is our Christian duty to ensure that we care for those who are left behind, that we do not allow our economy to crush our people for mere profit.\n\nUnfettered capital is just as dangerous as unfettered syndicalism.\n\n Thus there must be some government involvement in the economy, for the safety and security of all, in the national interest."

It is not only ridiculous that they are in government, but positively dangerous!\n\nThe only logical solution is for the Balaton Bloc to align with the Liberal Bloc - which will happen, when the Danubian electorate realise that the SDAPD do not have their best interests at heart.

It's outstayed it's welcome, and the federal government could do much better if great ideas aren't immediately shot down on grounds of ideology by certain members of the ruling elite.\n\nBy making an alliance with the Liberals, the Balaton Bloc will be in a better position to actually push through their own agenda in addition to allowing us to help them."

krg_dnf_federal_elections.37.t: "Standing Ready"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.37.d: "Danubia must be vigilant, for we are surrounded by parties who would wish to harm us, either directly or indirectly. The status of the armed forces must be maintained, our politicians must remain great minds and our nation must stand ready to defend it's people, whilst trying to step back from the looming precipice of an atomic war.\n\nTwo Weltkriegs was enough, surely..."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.37.a: "The Price of Peace is High"

krg_dnf_federal_elections.38.t: "The Foundations of our Strength"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.38.d: "Danubia's domestic military enterprises are some of the finest in the world, exporting weapons abroad as well as selling cutting edge military equipment to our own armies. To ignore them, or worse yet, decry them as merchants of death is to miss the point.\n\nA strong military industrial complex translates into a strong Danubia. Our interests are common, and should be treated as such."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.38.a: "Alignment is key"

krg_dnf_federal_elections.39.t: "Continuing Development Strategies"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.39.d: "The involvement of the federal government in making controlled improvements to regional economies has proven an unbounded success. We should not shy away from continuing to make intervetions and create jobs for Danubian citizens.\n\nBy developing our economy in co-ordination with the state we can ensure that the interests of both are met, without the market running loose and disrupting people's lives."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.39.a: "Excellent"

krg_dnf_federal_elections.40.t: "A New Path to Victory"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.40.d: "The ideological underpinnings of our movement were once considered by Professor Othmar Spann. His conclusion was that the state is the true binding agent of Danubian-ness. By building the Danubian Identity in alignment with the interests of the state, we can revitalise our political campaigns, and create a more cohesive nation.\n\nUltimately this will wash away the petty nationalisms that have dogged our nation for decades."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.40.a: "Together we are stronger"

krg_dnf_federal_elections.41.t: "Rocks and Shoals"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.41.d: "Navigating between the flows of the Reichspakt and Accord is a skillful art, one that we must continue to pursue. For at the heart of the eddies and currents and tides of the Kalterkrieg lurks the abyss of global nuclear war.\n\nWe cannot allow this to happen."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.41.a: "In case you've forgotten, we're in a war."

krg_dnf_federal_elections.42.t: "Peace through Strength"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.42.d: "The Balaton Bloc knows that unfortunately kind words and peaceful ventures will only go so far in dealing with our opponents and our allies. Be the nice guy one time too many and you get labelled a pushover. The resolution is therefore that we must maintain our own strength and our own deterrent. \n\nWe seek a lasting peace, yes, but backed by more than mere resolve."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.42.a: "Alas, that Might makes Right"

krg_dnf_federal_elections.43.t: "A Bastion of Democracy"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.43.d: "Danubia is one of the truly free democracies in the world, one that has grown stronger and stronger under the stewardship of the Balaton Bloc. While Germany threatens to fall to authoritarianism and Russia is overran by militarist thugs, Danubia stands alone in Central Europe as a free democracy.\n\nWe must stand for liberty, lest no-one else does."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.43.a: "A point of light in the dark."

krg_dnf_federal_elections.44.t: "The Balaton Bloc win in Danubia!"
krg_dnf_federal_elections.44.d: "After a closely fought election, the conservative Balaton Bloc have been called upon to form a government with their leader, Leopold Figl (centre) at the helm.\n\nThere is a full expectation of a continuation of the agreement known as the Grand Coalition will continue, with former Foreign Affairs Minister Figl looking to solidify Danubia's current foreign policy stance and bringing a more active involvement globally."
krg_dnf_federal_elections.44.a: "Danubia falls into a camp..."

## Post Election Shit ##

krg_dnf_post_el.0.t: "Maximilian Ronge Tenders His Retirement"
krg_dnf_post_el.0.d: "Stalwart Veteran of the Intelligence Department, and Head since the unfortunate revelation that Col. Redl was a Russian Double Agent in 1913, Maximilian Ronge has been the spymaster of Austria Hungary and then Danubia for the lifetime of many.\n\nHowever time waits for no man, and he has decided to step back from the role and enjoy the last few years of his life in peace and quiet."
krg_dnf_post_el.0.a: "A well deserved rest."

  ## Some Scharf stuff
krg_dnf_post_el.1.t: "Providing Reassurances"
krg_dnf_post_el.1.d: "Although many people voted for and gave their time and energy to support our political campaign in the recent election, there remains the fact that the majority of Danubian voters did not vote for our party.\n\nFor many there are fears that we are in thrall to foreign ideas, and the ghosts of the Syndicalist past in Europe have not lain in their graves for long.\n\nTherefore it is prudent, even though we are still in coalition with the Balaton Bloc, to provide reassurances to the voters of other parties and that our designs are only with the best intentions, and we have no plan to drag the nation into some ideological war or other nonsense."
krg_dnf_post_el.1.a: "A faintly bitter taste in my mouth to admit it."

krg_dnf_post_el.2.t: "The Price of Peace"
krg_dnf_post_el.2.d: "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\n\nThis world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people... This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense.\n\nWe need to find a way to spend less on our military without compromising our security."
krg_dnf_post_el.2.a: "A Cross of Iron is hard to bear."

# Abolish National Diets
krg_dnf_post_el.3.t: "Ratification of the Personal Princip and the Abolition of the National Diets"
krg_dnf_post_el.3.d: "Countless hours, days, months and years after the Personal Principle was first imagined, the Danubian Federation today reached a quorum amongst the National Diets willing to move to abolition in order for a true Federal government to support and uphold the individual's rights.\n\nDebates that went on late into the night, countless arguments, discussions and contests of will, vast quantities of time and energy spent... and now all of that energy is free to go forward and forge Danubia into a truly multi-national state."
krg_dnf_post_el.3.a: "Herr Renner, it was for you."

# Question of Mitteleuropa
krg_dnf_post_el.4.t: "A Request to the National Diets"
krg_dnf_post_el.4.d: "Since the arrival of the invitation to Mitteleuropa, German diplomats have been gently raising the question on a regular basis. The answer has always been the same, we need to ratify this at the level of the crownlands.\n\nNow however, with the latest federal election question settled, we are actually in a good position to do something about this. So the federal government today requests of the national diets to consider the entry of the Federation into Mitteleuropa."
krg_dnf_post_el.4.a: "We can only wonder at the response."

# Answer of Mitteleuropa
krg_dnf_post_el.5.t: "Ratification of Danubian Entry into Mitteleuropa"
krg_dnf_post_el.5.d: "After much hard work and politicking, the Danubian Federation today reached a quorum amongst the National Diets willing to move to ratify the entry of the Federation into the Mitteleuropan trade bloc on favourable terms.\n\nDebates that went on late into the night, countless arguments, discussions and contests of will, vast quantities of time and energy spent... and now all of that energy is free to go forward and forge an expanded Danubian involvement in the Mitteleuropa bloc."
krg_dnf_post_el.5.a: "Excellent"

# End Figl Plan
krg_dnf_post_el.6.t: "The End of the Figl Plan"
krg_dnf_post_el.6.d: "Millions of Kronen, thousands of manhours, and the work of many hands has left Europe, if not utterly rebuilt in a new image, at least repaired of it's most disfiguring scars.\n\nThe Figl Plan has served it's purpose and can now be wound down, leaving a lasting legacy on the face of Europe, a memorial both to the horror of the Second Weltkrieg, and of the generosity of Danubia to her allies."
krg_dnf_post_el.6.a: "All good things must end."

# Modernisation of Agriculture
krg_dnf_post_el.7.t: "Modernising Danubian Agriculture"
krg_dnf_post_el.7.d: "The fact the Danubian Agriculture in some places still resembles the previous century is a hard one to bear. In distributing the wealth more equally between our citizens we must not forget to bring them forward.\n\nThe question however is how can we support the modernisation of agriculture in an efficient manner, that returns the most benefit for all?"
krg_dnf_post_el.7.a: "Promote the smallholdings to be bought out by larger agribusinesses."
krg_dnf_post_el.7.b: "Ease lending restrictions to smallholders so that they might be able to access credit."
krg_dnf_post_el.7.c: "Institute a Federal Farming Standards commission which can support struggling and censure failing farms"

# Modernisation of Agriculture A
krg_dnf_post_el.8.t: "Smallholders Resist Big Business"
krg_dnf_post_el.8.d: "Despite the benevolence and generous offers of the agribusiness combines, there are many peasants who seem to prefer to spend their lives in backward rurality, rather than work as tenants on farms they once owned, or take big payouts and head to the city.\n\nTensions have spiked nationally as dissatisfied farmers have taken to street protests against 'big foreign inteference', particularly since many of the larger agribusinesses are Hungarian or Austrian in origin and many of the more backward farms are in non-Hungarian/German ethnic areas."
krg_dnf_post_el.8.a: "Agh! Don't they understand?"

# Modernisation of Agriculture B
krg_dnf_post_el.9.t: "Successful Policy Returns"
krg_dnf_post_el.9.d: "Despite some initial concerns amongst the banking sector, smallholders have spent their newfound credit in a mostly resposnible fashion, buying farm equipment as promised, or expanding their holdings by buying out their neighbours who no longer wish to work the soil.\n\nOverall this laissez-faire, minor adjustment of the scales has proven to be a great success."
krg_dnf_post_el.9.a: "Brilliant."

# TransAlpine Routes
krg_dnf_post_el.10.t: "Expanding into Italy"
krg_dnf_post_el.10.d: "The Trans-Alpine Rail and Road network is greater than ever, but presently it reaches our border with Italy and falters somewhat disappointingly. The state of roads on the Italian side is rather woeful to say the least.\n\nSince Italian goods are in great demand by certain sectors of the Federal population, perhaps we should offer to build up the roads on the other side of the border, as a fraternal gesture?"
krg_dnf_post_el.10.a: "That would be most kind of us."
krg_dnf_post_el.10.b: "Let the Italians pay for their own roads."

# Modernisation of Agriculture C
krg_dnf_post_el.11.t: "Federal Farming Commission Progress Report"
krg_dnf_post_el.11.d: "Having integrated with local farmers organisations across the country, the Farming Commission has so far proven to be vaguely popular.\n\nNot particularly considered useful (the peasants considering their own way of working the land superior in many cases), they're mostly reporting their attempts to assist are met with mild perplexion and occasional muttering about government interference."
krg_dnf_post_el.11.a: "Oh well, we tried."

# The Death of Alcide De Gasperi 1
krg_dnf_post_el.12.t: "Alcide De Gasperi has died!"
krg_dnf_post_el.12.d: "Alcide de Gasperi suffered a massive heart attack and collapsed yesterday evening. Unfortunately by the time that he was found by his wife, Francesca, he had already passed on. He is survived by his four daughters and is due to be buried in a Catholic ceremony in Borgo Valsugana in the Südtyrol.\n\nHis close ally in the Balaton Bloc, Zoltán Tildy has been appointed interim leader of the party for the time being."
krg_dnf_post_el.12.a: "Oh, what awful news!"

# The Death of Alcide De Gasperi 2
krg_dnf_post_el.13.t: "Appointing a Successor"
krg_dnf_post_el.13.d: "As the dust settles and the business of running the country resumes after the Funeral, the interior salons of the Balaton Bloc have been quietly abuzz with the talk of who should succeed to the role of Minister President.\n\nThe ship of State of Danubia cannot remain vacant for long, but unlike Miklas's retirement, there seems to be little stomach for another political fight. However, aside from the interim leader Zoltán Tildy, Leopold Figl has let it be known that he believes the time has come for him to perhaps lead the country into the next election.\n\nIt seems the choice could go either way, and it might come down to one single voice amongst the party masses."
krg_dnf_post_el.13.a: "Zoltán Tildy will finish the job Alcide started."
krg_dnf_post_el.13.b: "Leopold Figl has been waiting too long for his chance."

# The Death of PM Alcide De Gasperi (news)
krg_dnf_news.18.t: "Minister-President of Danubia has died."
krg_dnf_news.18.d: "Alcide De Gasperi died of a heart attack in his home yesterday after an apparently particularly stressful day. The coroner's report states that the scale of such a heart-attack would be lethal in a forty year old, never mind a man of De Gasperi's age. He is survived by his wife Francesca, and four daughters, Maria Romana, Lucia, Cecilia and Paola. \n\nHis political role has been handed over to his close ally in the Danubian conservative bloc, Zoltán Tildy, for the time being."
krg_dnf_news.18.a: "How sad."

# A Federation Of Nations
krg_dnf_post_el.15.t: "Deciding on our Vision"
krg_dnf_post_el.15.d: "Two strains have been running through Danubian politics for years - that of the Balaton Bloc and that of the Social Democrats.\n\nThey co-exist, intertwine and work with one another in a co-ordinated manner mostly. However, there are also forces in that paired thread that pull apart from one another and are ultimately diametrically opposed. The question of the future therefore boils down to one question, at least in the grand scheme of the nation.\n\nDo we lean full into cooperation and accept the foibles of our allies, try and build something between us that is greater than the sum? \n\nOr do we try to continue to strike forth on our own, to one day rule alone perhaps even? And reshape the nation fully in our image and our image alone." 
krg_dnf_post_el.15.a: "The future of Danubia is that of the Grand Coalition"
krg_dnf_post_el.15.b: "The future of Danubia is that of the Balaton Bloc"

# The Economics of Prosperity
krg_dnf_post_el.16.t: "Opening the Danubian Markets"
krg_dnf_post_el.16.d: "The second largest nation in Europe, and one of the largest gross domestic products in the world is that of Danubia. We have a large manufacturing base, a service industry that can communicate and work across borders, internal and external.\n\nThe Danubian Krone is backed by gold, and is convertible both to the Accord fiat currencies and the Reichsmark, with a bit of imaginative accounting. But there are still is a great deal of state involvement, past the basic formalities of customes. The Danubian economy has potential to grow even stronger and moving to a more open model will allow all that money to flow into the country much more easily."
krg_dnf_post_el.16.a: "Logical."

# Danubian Personhood
krg_dnf_post_el.17.t: "What does being Danubian mean?"
krg_dnf_post_el.17.d: "Being Danubian cannot be seen simply as being as a citizen of the Danubian Federation. We have to ensure that our people understand that they are part of a great melting pot.\n\nWe can promote the idea of Danubian-ness as an identity that is both adjacent to and above the various national identities within the nation. The Danubian concept must also align with, but not exclusively centre around loyalty to the Habsburgs. Rather we must create a pan-ethnic identity that will unite the disparate peoples of the Federation.\n\nPromoting this however, has upset a number of nationalist groups, who are spreading misinformation and propaganda about the meaning of, and ultimate goal of the Danubian idea."
krg_dnf_post_el.17.a: "Some people are just stuck in the past."

# GC Negotiations
krg_dnf_post_el.18.t: "Negotiating with the Hardliners"
krg_dnf_post_el.18.d: "The Hardliner faction is still part of the Balaton Bloc. Excluding them from the table will ultimately lead to them breaking off and weakening our electoral position, such that we would be forced to be the junior partner in coalition with the SDAPD.\n\nIt took an extended period, with a great deal of reassurances and promises that we would not transgress on certain positions. But eventually they acknowledged the fact that our mutual survival in the political arena requires us both to work together, and that we have more in common than we have in differences."
krg_dnf_post_el.18.a: "What a slog fest."

# Balaton Negotiations
krg_dnf_post_el.19.t: "Negotiating with the Hardliners"
krg_dnf_post_el.19.d: "The Hardliner faction is still part of the Balaton Bloc. Excluding them from the table will ultimately lead to them breaking off and weakening our electoral position, such that we would be forced to be the junior partner in coalition with the SDAPD.\n\nHowever our agreed agenda with regard to a new Federation, and the plan for the Danubian future meant that this conversation was one mostly on agreeing on mutualities as opposed to any drawn out argument. Both parts of the party agreed it is important we keep an eye on the SDAPD and extract what we can use from them without capitulating our own identity."
krg_dnf_post_el.19.a: "Easier than expected."

# Crownland Development Programme Rollout
krg_dnf_post_el.20.t: "Inauguration of the Crownland Development Office"
krg_dnf_post_el.20.d: "Whilst there are broad planned infrastructural and specific investment projects, the Crownland Development Office is meant to change individual lives for the better, to both improve the access to education and skills and to help with family planning for people from the most impoverished regions.\n\nThe Development Programme inaugurated today is going to be a legacy of this government, long after we have left office."
krg_dnf_post_el.20.a: "A red letter day."

# Social-Industrial Complex
krg_dnf_post_el.21.t: "The New Towns of Danubia"
krg_dnf_post_el.21.d: "As the population of the country expands, and life becomes increasingly urbanised, we need to build new cities so that our existing city centres don't become choked with smog and people. Planned developments to provide living spaces for workers and professionals in satellite towns have been planned in several nations, and with an injection of federal funding we can accelerate their development.\n\nMore than that, we can take the opportunity to design a city from scratch, and build it in an optimal fashion, as opposed to the chaotic winding streets that sprung out of old villages merging together.\n\nFour specific sites have been outlined as targets. The expansion of the village of Neufeld in the Burgenland, Havířov in Moravian Silesia, Akadémiaújtelep in the Budapest suburbs and Dubrava in Zagreb."
krg_dnf_post_el.21.a: "A template for the future."

# Strength in Diversity
krg_dnf_post_el.22.t: "Greater Than The Sum of Our Parts"
krg_dnf_post_el.22.d: "He might be a Hungarian, she might be a Czech. Those two at the next table come from Austria. The man with the moustache in the corner smoking a cigarette is from Galicia. Her, serving the coffee? She's from Dalmatia. The man in the back washing the dishes is from Transylvania.\n\nBut they are all part of the Danubian People.\n\nWe have many nationalities, many ethnicities. Historically people like the Hungarians and the Germans had some privileges. However we have all been equal for some time now. There are those who still blindly believe they'd do better casting off on their own, but a great deal of them realise that they have greater opportunities and chances in their lives as part of the Danubian people.\n\nEthnic chauvinism has no place in our society."
krg_dnf_post_el.22.a: "E Pluribus Unum."

# Reconsidering The Reichspakt
krg_dnf_post_el.23.t: "Calling Time?"
krg_dnf_post_el.23.d: "Germany is sliding into an authoritarian coma.\n\nThey rely on us as their ally and yet we profess to believe in democracy and freedom. Our government is currently in the unfortunate position of promoting liberty at home whilst supporting oppression abroad.\n\nAre we going to do this whilst the Germans stand on the backs of their allies in Eastern Europe, their subjects in Africa, their own people under the 'Neuer Staat'?\n\nJust stand, and let their leaders grind the world under their heel? Or should we focus on our own problems and let them have their Kalterkrieg."
krg_dnf_post_el.23.a: "We cannot stand idly by."
krg_dnf_post_el.23.b: "Our security relies on Germany."

# Danubia's Best Interest
krg_dnf_post_el.24.t: "Steering the Ship"
krg_dnf_post_el.24.d: "'Civilization begins with order, grows with liberty and dies with chaos.'\n\nThis land has known many names and had many owners. Not 500 years ago, the Ottoman Turk rode roughshod over the Hungarian on the Pannonian Plain and fought the hardy Illyrians in Slavonia. The Austrian Habsburgs pushed them back, and time did the rest. Then they formed an empire... then they made a compromise with the Hungarian part of that empire and made the dual monarchy. Then, they saw that the dual monarchy did not serve it's purpose and so they met at Keszthely with the great minds of the nation and they proclaimed the Danubian Federation.\n\nSimultaneously hundreds of years old, and less then three decades, this country is still in a continuous state of motion, transforming again into a power of wealth and strength. Liberty is the word of the day, and the nation is blossoming. Long may it grow... and may it never reach the point of chaos."
krg_dnf_post_el.24.a: "To Danubia!"

# Pragmatic Investments
krg_dnf_post_el.25.t: "Putting Money Where It's Needed"
krg_dnf_post_el.25.d: "There are regions within the crownlands that are astonishingly poor. Some are close to the hearts of their inhabitants however, and their nationalism is, in some respects, fostered by the poverty they are surrounded by. By judiciously applying state funds to certain regions, encouraging industrial development and increasing the growth of towns and villages, we can tamp down that nationalism.\n\nWe must ensure it is understood that their future is best served, within Danubia."

# Donauvolksgemeinschaft
krg_dnf_post_el.26.t: "Federal Youth Development Service"
krg_dnf_post_el.26.d: "One of the great measures that was taken historically and we should take on board is the idea of mandatory national service. Whilst we have an existing system of conscription, the young women of Danubia do not have a similar experience. By making it possible that young people of both genders can work in projects across the country, to meet other youth from other regions and give them chances to practise the languages they're learning in school.\n\nThe future of Danubia lies in its youth. We must remind them to both work together for the nation, and that their compatriots are not their enemies.\n\nWe must ensure the future is Danubian."
krg_dnf_post_el.26.a: "One Nation under the Kaiser."


# Building Consensus
 krg_dnf_post_el.27.t: "Rallying the Grand Coalition"
 krg_dnf_post_el.27.d: "After the competition of an election, it always makes sense to turn around to your coalition partner and shake them on the hand, congratulate them on a well fought campaign and settle the waters.\n\nNow is the time for such, if we want to be assured of completing our political agenda going forwards, we are still counting on their votes. Better to smooth things over now, than get stuck on a thorny problem later."
 krg_dnf_post_el.27.a: "Everything's better when we work together"

# Reconciling the Hardliners

 krg_dnf_post_el.28.d: "The Hardliners are continuously pushing their agenda, sometimes at odds with the bulk of the party, sometimes with enough to convince other moderates to waver. We have to break this habit and pattern of Factionalism however, since the only ones who will gain from our disarray are our political opponents. A concession to the Hardliners has to be made in order to get them to calm themselves somewhat and allow us time to breathe.\n\nThe question is thus - do we give them an immediate gift (such as the Federal Exchequer), one where they have had a candidate in the wings for some time... or do we promise them something in the future, like their group leader Leopold Figl being chosen as the next leader of the party..."
 krg_dnf_post_el.28.a: "Give Illig the job."

# Cantonisation Implementation
krg_dnf_post_el.29.t: "Laying out the Cantons"
krg_dnf_post_el.29.d: "The Danubian map is a patchwork sea, when broken up by ethnicity, or by language spoken at home. It contains vast oceans of one culture with thousands of islands of others sprinkled across it, like a map of the South Pacific.\n\nThe Popovici proposal of 1905, combined with the Balaton crownlands of 1938 provides a strong basis, but by adding these additional cantons across Danubia, we have managed to provide better representation for the various ethnic groups within the country. The federation is taking a truer form now, with the realignment of internal borders to better reflect and support their populations within the Danubian whole."
krg_dnf_post_el.29.a: "Excellent"

# Budget reallocation 
 krg_dnf_post_el.30.t: "Budget reallocation"
 krg_dnf_post_el.30.d: "The Federal Budget is healthy enough, in fact the country is generating more revenue than we expected primarily in taxation on exports, so we can invest some of that surplus into our political agenda. \n\nThe federal exchequer are preparing the announcement for the Minister-President to make shortly and we expect that the party will have a good news day as a result."

# Social Housing stock
 krg_dnf_post_el.31.t: "Expanding the Social Housing stock"
 krg_dnf_post_el.31.d: "The pressure on the housing stock of our cities only grows as more people flood in from the countryside.\n\nWe must avoid the cities becoming filthy warrens with no go areas and ghettos as well as throngs homeless and impoverished individuals cramming the streets. Thus the government announced a state sponsored expansion of the social housing stock, with the development of government owned housing as well as financial incentives and eased planning requirements for new housing construction."

# Employment Opportunities Commission

 krg_dnf_post_el.33.d: "Whilst the original Balaton Agreement nationalities act provided a lot of ground-work for the process, for a long time, Minister-President De Gasperi has felt that it did not go far enough, especially in it's clumsy division of the empire into majoritarian areas which has served as an ongoing source of dissention and dispute ever since.\n\nThe establishment of cultural and public educational institutions in support of, and the acknowledgement of the needs of 'minority' nationalities within the borders of each crownland is the primary aim of this change.

We can also potentially perform greater feats due to the fact we will take a larger amount of money in Taxation if we increase it. It has to go without saying though, that raised taxes are never going to be popular."

krg_dnf_post_el.35.d: "The fearsome aspect of nuclear weapons and fissile material is partly that they are unregulated. By creating an International Atomic Energy Agency (headquartered in Vienna) we can promote the 'safe and secure' use of nuclear technology between the nuclear powers.\n\nAdditionally we can create a clearing house for nuclear deals in which the governments that hold nuclear stockpiles can make agreements and perhaps even move towards disarmament in the future."

krg_dnf_post_el.37.d: "One of the harder things we have to do is reconcile the differences in our foreign policy positions and our domestic ones. We cannot in good faith attempt to build our nation and promote peace and understanding if we ignore what is going on around us.\n\nIt is time perhaps to look at some elephants in the room, and examine how we can work toward ensuring that the future for tomorrow's generation is not built just for Danubia but for all."

krg_dnf_post_el.38.d: "The federal institutions inherited from the Staatsrecht system are - frankly, rather understrength for the task that is going to be administering the nation. Time and energy has to be dedicated to both building the institutions that do not exist, and expanding those that do.\n\nBy developing the institutions of the state, we are going to lay the groundwork for Danubia to maintain it's position in the world."

krg_dnf_post_el.39.d: "The Danubian Federation is a chimaera in some respects. However there are certain common threads from which we can forge ties that bind us all together. Some obvious ones, unfortunately, are not universally true but they are close enough to be used too.\n\nThe universal one that we must predicate the Federation's future on is the imperial dynasty - the Habsburgs are the common thread of all things. A common one is our Christianity - only Bosnia has any significant minority who are not some kind of Christian, and there are of course the Jewish communities but the difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism is something that can be overlooked, at least at the official level. Additionally the Danubian identity should be constructed around the ideal of upholding the rule of law, equality and freedom.\nNationalism is a hollow phantom which we must be vigilant against as we form a supra-national community of Danubians, unified by these ideals."
krg_dnf_post_el.39.a: "Good values to hold."

krg_dnf_post_el.41.d: "The Federal government has subsidised agriculture across the country since it's formation. However the recent influx of youth to the cities looking for work implies that our farmers may need some additional support.\n\nExpanding the subsidies programme won't damage the Federal budget, and it will win a lot of political goodwill in the countryside of our great nation, as well as ensuring our continued food security after the dark days of the first Weltkrieg."

We fought the Turks together and resisted Russian and Prussian aggression. The Habsburgs have forged an empire that has stood tests of time such as the First and Second Weltkrieg, and then upon realising that they could no longer hold it by force, they reformed it into our great state.\n\nThe Danubian Federation represents a trajectory for social and civilisational growth around which we will all prosper and be raised, if people just band together and see that there is more strength in our diversity and unity than there is our dissention and squabbling. \n\nWe can still be Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Rusyns, Galicians, Italians, Vlachs... but..."

krg_dnf_post_el.43.d: "The Christian Democratic current and school of thought is one that has led Danubia to prosperity and success. The Habsburg Imperium formed the nation under the aegis of Christian resistance to the Turk.\n\nIt is obvious, that the future of the nation must have room for Christian thought and Christian ideas. To do otherwise would be to cut a thread to our shared past.\n\nUsing this thread is also good electoral sense. After all, God can see the voter in the booth..."

krg_dnf_post_el.44.d: "After the publishing of Paneuropa by Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi in 1923, the idea of a Pan-European state has been one that has grown in popular consciousness. As a basis, the reformed Danubian Federation would provide a great example. The idea that a social conservative, co-operative society where individualism and socialism can co-ordinate, much as the Grand Coalition does in Danubia, would be a peaceful solution to many of the ills faced in Europe.\n\nThe idea is that such a state would supersede and make redundant the current division of the world into two armed camps."

The comments which Wiesenthal is making a claim against were alleged to be both personally slanderous and in contravention of the Nationalities Act as it presently stands.\n\nThis has potential to be both politically embarrassing for the Grand Coalition, and to worsen the nationalist tensions across the country."

krg_dnf_post_el.46.d: "A strong element of the Agrarian party and our allies in the FBLP both feel that the Grand Coalition committed too much of Danubia's attention abroad, in order to sooth and keep on board the Hardliner faction of the Balaton Bloc under Leopold Figl as foreign minister. We now have a chance to change policy at the foreign office, however we have the Balaton Bloc as our coalition allies.\n\nWe must decide, do we tick off Figl and maintain our own principles, or do we accommodate our coalition partner?"

krg_dnf_post_el.47.d: "The faction seems to never end with our coalition partners. The FBLP and the DVP are at odds constantly on matters of economic policy, with the Agrarians and Minister-President Veres having to spend energy on dealing with their squabbles instead of building a better nation.\n\nFor the time being it seems like the easiest thing to do is to give one something and punish the other, in the hope they will stop behaving like children and start working together."

The DVP by their numbers and strength are essentially swallowing our policy vision and crippling any truly Agrarian initiatives. \n\nThis coalition agreement is starting to feel more like a prison than some power sharing agreement, but the Danubian Federal government has no precedent for triggering early elections, and with the breaking of the Liberal coalition we'd no longer be in a position to form a government if a vote of no confidence occurred. \n\nThe only option seems to be to make it to the election period and hope we at least retain the majority of our seats."

krg_dnf_post_el.49.d: "Since the SDAPD joined the coalition it has become increasingly hard to make distinct Agrarian policy actually work. The SDAPD by their numbers and strength are constantly at odds with the FBLP as the parties agendas are almost diametrically opposed. Worse yet this infighting is very public and just makes Minister-President Veres look like a fool for trying to square this circle. \n\nThe coalition agreement is starting to feel more like a trap than some power sharing agreement, but the Danubian Federal government has no precedent for triggering early elections. With both the DVP and the SDAPD likely to refuse to form a new government with us if we broke with them, we'd no longer be in a position to form a government if a vote of no confidence occurred. \n\nThe only option seems to be to make it to the election period and hope we at least retain the majority of our seats."

krg_dnf_post_el.50.d: "Jokingly referred to as 'the new Ausgleich' by the hardworking organisers of the Party Organisation Board, they have managed to organise a deal with a number of Agrarian parties in Hungary. The Minister-President was personally involved in ensuring that Hungarian interests, as the largest part of the Agrarian movement in Danubia would be at the forefront.\n\nLinguistic rights and the use of Hungarian as language of business will be respected, with the definitive legal texts of the parties founding and business being of equal importance between the German and Hungarian translations. Additionally it was stated that all documents would be at minimum in German and Hungarian in order to maintain understanding and communication within the party, to reduce ambiguity and to promote communication."

krg_dnf_post_el.51.d: "Locked out of the mainstream of politics between the CSP and the SDAPD in Austria, the Agrarian movement there is one that struggles to make it's voice heard when it's ideas are stolen by the CSP and the youth flock to the cities and fall under the honeyed words of the SDAPD. They had no explicit demands or requirements to form a federal party, except that they would expect more support to attempt to win this crucial region and break the duopoly."

krg_dnf_post_el.52.d: "The Croatian Peoples' Peasant Party is an old insitution in the Illyrian Crownland, but their efforts at convincing voters are falling flat. Agrarianism and being a peasant are unfortunately associated with the endemic unemployment the region suffered until recently when the SDAPD came into power. Simply put the party hasn't been able to keep up with their opponents. A disbursal from the Federal Aid budget and of course full support if they should miraculously win a campaign in Illyria one of these years will be enough to bring the region into the federal party."

krg_dnf_post_el.53.d: "The Christlichsoziale Partei of Bohemia is mostly a Sudeten German institution, one that has struggled politically for some time within the larger organisation of the crownland. Their politics are more toward those of the Hardliners in the Austrian party, as they have a sense of being stuck as the junior partner in coalition when the civilisation of the land around them was once theirs to command. Their leader, Oskar Schindler is a prominent local industrialist and mostly is involved as politics as a tool to lobby for better business tax rates.\nHe would be willing to move the party into the Federal organisation, with the right assistance, but he is concerned the more hardline element of his party would try and have him out on his heels. He's provided a list to the Party Organisation Board who are taking care of it, contacting them individually and convincing them of the necessity of a federal party to protect the rights of the Sudetenlanders in Bohemia."

As such we are approaching them as equal partners in ensuring that the Federal party is a representative entity for the current of Agrarian thought in Danubia.\n\nOur politics will therefore have some reflection of that of the Galician region going forwards, with us having to make agreements with the leadership there to ensure we will develop the province if we retain our grip on power."

krg_dnf_post_el.55.d: "While the Slovaks have poor, mountainous soil and much of the lifeblood of their land is the mines rather than the farms, there are still communities of peasants in the villages in the mountains. Any successful federalisation will rely on ensuring that they are sold on the idea - for these small communities are the lifeblood of Slovak agrarianism. They have had historically bad influences of Magyarisation on their land, so assurances that their autonomy and language rights will be preserved within the party will be strong point."

krg_dnf_post_el.56.d: "To those on the political inside track this is not a shock, acquisition of a suitable property in Wien to serve as a headquarters for the party alone has prompted much speculation. But today the official press release was made to quell media interest.\nThe various agrarian parties at the federal level all jointly announced their dissolution and replacement, with all present ministers retaining their posts, as an officially constituted party at the Federal level under the name 'Progressiv-Agrarisch-Demokratischer Bund' (PADB).

We are in uncharted waters for the state of the country, and it is not so surprising he is in need of some calming. So that is exactly what Minister President Veres did, meeting with the Kaiser at his office in the Hofburg in order to smooth matters over."

Recent complaints and issues around the disparity in pensions for equal work performed during the war years will now hopefully be resolved.\n\nThe formation of this office represents an expansion of the Federal government, but not one that any would be willing to argue is a negative one."

However Janos von Neumann, one of the leading lights in the field has recently directly approached the government in pursuit of financing for his own firm in order to develop a 'second-generation' transistor based computer, which will be much cheaper and reliable than the current vacuum-tube based designs. Getting a headstart in this important technical field will potentially win the future for Danubia.\n\nThe Federal Exchequer reports that diversion of funds for R&D in this matter would not be a substantial issue."

In anticipation of massive air raid casualties, the Federal Emergency Medical Service had brought the country's municipal and voluntary hospitals into one umbrella organisation, showing that a national hospital service was possible.\n\nOnce done, it seemed nonsensical to undo, yet it was under the auspices national autonomies that they were broken back to the level of the crownlands and even in some cases to municipal levels once more. However the memory has proven strong and many have agitated for the resumption of a Federal health care service.\n\nThe Danubian government is pleased to announce now that not only will there be a Federal one, but it will be at the point of use, and for most cases, free of charge. After all... No society can legitimately call itself civilized if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means."

For too long we have been content to let charitable movements and others ameliorate the issue of unemployment in some regions without taking an active stance on tackling it ourselves. The national infrastructure and development programmes have shown that there are no true obstacles against the Danubian economy that cannot be overcome without a bit of energy.\n\nThis simply promises to continue those programmes in a constructive and federal manner after their success on regional scales."

By having the commission's existence be tied to government mandate, it's felt this ensures the responsiveness and decision making of the commission remains grounded in the current realities.\n\nSome of their more excitable members like to advocate for grand pie in the sky schemes, so reminding them they depend on us keeps them grounded."

If we can convince the SDAPD to see it that way as well, we can continue to do business together for a long time.
