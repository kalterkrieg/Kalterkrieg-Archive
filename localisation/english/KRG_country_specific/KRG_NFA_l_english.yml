  ### Radicals Tree ###
   NFA_the_mendes_government: "The Mendes Government"
   NFA_the_mendes_government_desc: "The 1946 elections have come and gone, and Pierre Mendes-France and his Parti Radical have emerged victorious. Leading a grand coalition, Mendes-France has declared his intention to uphold the liberties and stability of the French nation, through economic and political reforms. However, Mendes-France has an important decision ahead of him: does he re-invite the USR to mainstream French politics after decades of de facto exile, or does he stick with the UDC and the FD to keep France on a centrist tilt? It is up to him to decide, and he must do it soon."
   NFA_toward_reconciliation: "Toward Reconciliation"
   NFA_toward_reconciliation_desc: "Ever since the exile to North Africa, the USR, the social democratic party in France, has been left out to dry by the prominent reactionary elements that gained power during that time. This ends now.  The USR is just as democratic as the other parties that make up the center and center-right, and Mendes-France has seen fit to make a coalition with them. Hopefully, this will deflect the ire of syndicalist holdouts within the French underground. However, this move will strengthen François de la Rocque and his group, as he will no doubt capitalize on the government's shift to the left."
   NFA_further_our_welfare_reforms: "Further Our Welfare Reforms"
   NFA_further_our_welfare_reforms_desc: "While our current welfare reforms are a good start, we are still a long way away from building a true safety net for the citizenry through welfare. We must ensure that, even in hard times, the French worker can easily pull himself to his feet and never have to worry about poverty stifling the livelihood of himself and his family."
   NFA_protect_local_cooperatives: "Protect Local Cooperatives"
   NFA_protect_local_cooperatives_desc: "A cooperative is a cooperative, no matter how small or localized it may be. It guarantees the rights, protections, and benefits of workers who participate, and it would be criminal to take that away from them because their cooperative is deemed too small. We must produce legislation that protects cooperatives of all sizes from privatization by big business."
   NFA_reinforce_secular_laws: "Reinforce Secular Laws"
   NFA_reinforce_secular_laws_desc: "Ever since the Revolution, France has been a secular nation, a place where anyone of any religious affiliation will not have to fear persecution for their beliefs. Now, with groups like de la Rocque's PSF and the specter of Maurras and De Gaulle's AF, it is more important than ever to reinforce secularism into the French popular consciousness. France will always be a place of equality, no matter what the reactionary traditionalists say!"
   NFA_work_with_the_psdf: "Work With the PSdF"
   NFA_work_with_the_psdf_desc: "The PSdF is a group of former Communards who have dedicated themselves to protecting French democracy and combating the German menace up north. Both Mendes-France and the USR  share common ground with them, so it would be foolish to reject any offers of partnership with them. It has the potential to be a mutually beneficial relationship that can help both organizations flourish."
   NFA_departmental_devolution: "Departmental Devolution"
   NFA_departmental_devolution_desc: "In order to better understand and fix the problems of the citizenry, we must continue to decentralize and federalize France. By delegating powers from the central government to provincial and departmental levels, we can help bring the voice of the voiceless to the ears of the central government officials to help resolve their issues and improve the quality of their lives."
   NFA_the_general_amnesty_law_of_year: "The General Amnesty Law of [GetYear]"
   NFA_the_general_amnesty_law_of_year_desc: "Not every Communard was a high-profile traitor. Many were simply ordinary people who were swept up in the charisma of the arch-traitors Léon Blum and Sébastien Faure and the fervor of the revolution. Executing them or letting them rot in a prison cell would be an injustice of the highest order. Thus, we will grant many former Communard officers and prisoners amnesty, so that we can prove ourselves to not be tyrants like the syndicalist holdouts think we are."
   NFA_continue_the_civilian_transition: "Continue the Civilian Transition"
   NFA_continue_the_civilian_transition_desc: "In order to uphold the flame of liberty in France, we must continue to move away from our past as a military administration. Political and civil rights must be made sacrosanct within the nation, and it is the duty of Mendes-France and his government to enshrine the ideas of political and personal freedoms in a civilian administration."
   NFA_dirigistes_principles: "Dirigistes Principles"
   NFA_dirigistes_principles_desc: "It is the duty of the state to uphold the value of the economy, and Mendes-France has dedicated himself to ensuring that France follows and sustains the idea. The state needs a firm hand in economic direction and development in order to properly mitigate the devastating effects of the Second World War and to bring the economy and living standards of France back on the upswing."
   NFA_guarantee_freedom_of_assembly: "Guarantee Freedom of Assembly"
   NFA_guarantee_freedom_of_assembly_desc: "Since the rule of Maréchal Pétain, personal liberties have been greatly reduced for the supposed protection of security it offered. This has been nothing but a falsehood constructed by the military junta to keep French citizens docile! Prime Minister Mendes-France will not tolerate violations of liberty against the French people, and is making moves to ensure that the citizenry will be afforded every right that they deserve. The first that Mendes-France has guaranteed is freedom of assembly. How can we call ourselves a democracy if we do not allow the people to organize and discuss political matters?"
   NFA_create_the_cndt: "Create the CNDT"
   NFA_create_the_cndt_desc: "Although France has had bad memories with unions in recent years, creating a moderate union that is aligned with Parti Radical is Mendes-France's next step forward in repairing the French economy. While more conservative elements will definitely protest at this move, a moderate and non-socialist union will benefit the working class and, by extension, the economy as a whole."
   NFA_enforce_mixed_schooling: "Enforce Mixed Schooling"
   NFA_enforce_mixed_schooling_desc: "For far too long, the 'Code of the Indigenous' has stifled promising young African students from achieving their fullest potential, wasting a massive talent pool for France. This ends now. Mendes-France recognizes the racism of the Code and how it alienates and angers our African subjects. If France, reasons Mendes-France, wants to live up to its motto of liberté, égalité, and fraternité, then shouldn't schooling be available to all French citizens, regardless of race?"
   NFA_consolidate_the_sncf: "Consolidate the SNCF"
   NFA_consolidate_the_sncf_desc: "The Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the nationalized railway of France, is a disjointed beast that needs to be rebuilt in order for French industry to regrow. By consolidating the railway, we can more easily control how to quickly and correctly connect the rails in France, thus making transportation logistics come up more easily and smoothly to ensure a faster economic recovery for France."
   NFA_found_sud_aviation: "Found Sud Aviation"
   NFA_found_sud_aviation_desc: "Since its discovery nearly fifty years ago, flight has revolutionized the way that global commerce and transportation function. It is imperative that France does not fall behind in the aviation industry, and so we must create one of our own. We shall introduce Sud Aviation, a way for France to be connected to the lucrative business of global air commerce, and thus be able to fund our recovery and receive supplies faster for the reconstruction of France."
   NFA_reform_the_banque_de_france: "Reform the Banque de France"
   NFA_reform_the_banque_de_france_desc: "The Banque de France has been France's central bank since the 1700s, and its age is starting to show. Mendes-France has seen fit to carry out extensive reforms to make the bank more accountable, accessible, and responsible for the common folk. The Bank should be a tool to help the people, not just a tool for the government to collect debts!"
   NFA_end_strike_restrictions: "End Strike Restrictions"
   NFA_end_strike_restrictions_desc: "Every worker has the right to protest unfair working conditions, and current legislation that we have passed is infringing on this basic right. It is our duty to eliminate this infringement of liberty and allow the working class to protest inhumane working conditions. While many of the more reactionary elements of society may claim this is crypto-syndicalism, it is imperative that we uphold the basic needs of the working class, lest they rise up in revolt yet again."
   NFA_abolish_the_state_of_emergency: "Abolish the State of Emergency"
   NFA_abolish_the_state_of_emergency_desc: "Since the Communard revolution in 1921, a state of emergency in France has been declared, giving the military near-ultimate authority over the citizens and state of France. Now that the syndicalist threat has been vanquished, it is time for the emergency to end. Its wanton disregard of personal liberties and political freedom has to end now that the mainland has been reclaimed, so that the fires of democracy may burn bright and true again."
   NFA_expand_the_education_budget: "Expand the Education Budget"
   NFA_expand_the_education_budget_desc: "Investing in French schools is the best possible investment that France can make, as we are helping raise our children to be exceptional and talented French citizens. Thus, it is top priority to expand our education budget to make sure that every French student is getting proper supplies and the best education that they can possibly receive. Having an undereducated populace is a national disaster that we must strive to avoid at all costs."
   NFA_create_the_ligue_universitaire: "Create the "Ligue Universitaire""
   NFA_create_the_ligue_universitaire_desc: "The 'Ligue Universitaire', or University League, is a proposed institution to improve the many colleges and universities of France by improving educational effectiveness and interconnectivity. The goal of this organization is to increase the innovativeness of the French people and nation, and with the approval of Mendes-France, this novel institution can begin its agenda of improving French education."
   NFA_support_agricultural_cooperatives: "Support Agricultural Cooperatives"
   NFA_support_agricultural_cooperatives_desc: "Agricultural cooperatives seek to maximize the benefits and profits that farmers receive, and Mendes-France has thrown a great deal of support behind the idea. After all, farmers are the backbone for any nation to thrive. While France's right-wingers, especially Rocquists, may object to this idea on the foolish basis that this is crypto-syndicalism, this move will improve the stability of France by giving the ones who hold it up the protection that they need and deserve."
   NFA_uphold_the_concentration_republicaine: "Uphold the "Concentration Républicaine""
   NFA_uphold_the_concentration_republicaine_desc: "The Concentration Républicaine is a term coined by Léon Gambetta in 1881 describing the need for the political center to unify against the radical left and right wings of politics. Now, with active syndicalists prowling in the hinterlands and the opportunistic French far-right now clawing at the seams of power, it is more important than ever for this principle to be upheld. Mendes-France has gathered a coalition of center-left and center-right parties in order to combat the threat of radicalism in French politics."
   NFA_relax_business_restrictions: "Relax Business Restrictions"
   NFA_relax_business_restrictions_desc: "While contrary to Mendes-France's adherence to dirigiste principles, he has seen the wisdom in relaxing business restrictions to improve the economy and satisfy the center-right wing of the coalition. Allowing businesses to run their own course for profits decreases needless and costly government intervention, and allows these companies to boost their own profits for themselves and the state through taxes. This will both strengthen the economy and allow the government to focus on more important matters."
   NFA_award_new_contracts: "Award New Contracts"
   NFA_award_new_contracts_desc: "Companies that were loyal and a useful asset to the French reclamation of the homeland should be rewarded, and they shall be rewarded by giving them new contracts to help rebuild the civilian sector of the economy. Renault can transition from tanks to cars, and other companies can begin this transition by being awarded said civilian contracts."
   NFA_privatize_small_cooperatives: "Privatize Small Cooperatives"
   NFA_privatize_small_cooperatives_desc: "While Mendes-France would like to support cooperatives of all sizes, having a grand coalition dictates that compromises are necessary. To this end, he has agreed to allow small cooperatives, which do not provide much to those involved anyway, to become privatized for profit. While this will understandably agitate said tradespeople who were participating, this move will satisfy the free marketeers and market libertarians within Mendes-France's coalition."
   NFA_revalorize_expert_wages: "Revalorize Expert Wages"
   NFA_revalorize_expert_wages_desc: "The experts of France, whether they be experts in economics, mathematics, engineering, logistics, and so on and so forth, deserve to be recognized for their accomplishments. To this end, we will markedly increase wages across the board for these achievers, who are doing everything they can to improve the situation for the French government and the lives of the French populace. Let the Rocquists protest what they see as elitism. They won't be so confrontational when they too are benefitting from the hard work these experts are putting in."
   NFA_ushering_in_the_new_middle_class: "Ushering In the New Middle Class"
   NFA_ushering_in_the_new_middle_class_desc: "Our multitudes of economic reforms and market relaxations have allowed a middle class to flourish in France for the first time since the exile to North Africa. With this comes a great economic boom and a marked increase to our governmental stability. This accomplishment has surged the popularity of both Mendes-France and the coalition, and has reduced the support of the more radical leftist and rightist groups in France."
   NFA_ecclesiastic_construction_funding: "Ecclesiastic Construction Funding"
   NFA_ecclesiastic_construction_funding_desc: "Although France since the revolution has been one of the most progressive nations of Europe, there has always been a traditional and conservative Catholic demographic within the nation. Normally, this group would vote farther right than our coalition, but perhaps we can sway them over to our side with more funding towards churches and cathedrals. Hopefully, this move will convince many traditionalists to side with us, robbing Rocque and the far-right of some of their greatest supporters."
   NFA_isolate_the_rocquists: "Isolate the Rocquists"
   NFA_isolate_the_rocquists_desc: "The Parti Social Français, led by François de la Rocque, is the greatest threat to French democracy that we are currently facing. Rocque's populist and hardcore conservative rhetoric has frightened many in the French political system about what will happen to democracy if he were to come to power. It is thus top priority to isolate him and his party to ensure that he cannot win the presidency or prime ministership, and hopefully turn his prime demographic into nothing but a fringe minority."

  ### Normalization and Reconstruction Tree ###
   NFA_open_the_ecole_nationale_dadministration: "Open the Ecole Nationale d'Administration"
   NFA_open_the_ecole_nationale_dadministration_desc: "By establishing and inaugurating the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the state will create a prestigious institution for training civil servants in France. This action encompasses the process of creating the school, including securing funding, developing a curriculum, hiring staff, and organizing the necessary infrastructure to provide a comprehensive educational experience for future civil servants. With a strong educated class of civil servants, the Republic will prosper as institutions are strengthened and reformed."
   NFA_expand_the_gendarmerie: "Expand the Gendarmerie"
   NFA_expand_the_gendarmerie_desc: "The republic must increase the size, capabilities, and resources of the Gendarmerie. This will involve recruiting and training additional personnel, acquiring new equipment and vehicles and establishing new branches or units in the metropole. The aim is to strengthen the Gendarmerie's ability to maintain public order, ensure safety, and enforce the law effectively across the country."
   NFA_create_the_police_nationale: "Create the Police Nationale"
   NFA_create_the_police_nationale_desc: "Regional gendarmes are well and good, but a top level organisation is required to co-ordinate their activities and if necessary step in and take over cases. By creating the police nationale the Republic will begin the process of developing a comprehensive organizational structure, defining roles and responsibilities, recruiting and training personnel, establishing protocols and procedures, and equipping the force with necessary resources. The aim is to create a dedicated law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining public safety, preventing and investigating crimes, and ensuring the security of the nation."
   NFA_renew_senatorial_seats: "Renew Senatorial Seats"
   NFA_renew_senatorial_seats_desc: "Renewing Senatorial Seats is a process that involves reevaluating and potentially revising the boundaries of the senatorial districts in a given jurisdiction. This action requires a thorough analysis of population demographics, geographic factors, and political considerations to ensure fair representation and proportional allocation of senatorial seats. The objective is to redetermine the boundaries of the districts in order to reflect changes in population distribution and maintain the democratic principle of equal representation for constituents in the legislative body."
   NFA_create_the_regions: "Create the Regions"
   NFA_create_the_regions_desc: "The Department system, a remnant of the French Revolution 1790 was created to replace Ancien Regime provinces on a 'rational' basis. The time has now come for a new rationalisation to occur, one that matches the current state of affairs and the new centrality of Marseille compared to previous times.\n\nThus the Regions will be created, so as to reflect this new, rational era of the French Republic."
   NFA_maintain_the_departments: "Maintain the Departments"
   NFA_maintain_the_departments_desc: "The Department system has served the country, with some modifications, since 1790 and there is no strong requirement to reorganise it further. There are some who seek a grand re-organisation but all they will do is impose disorder and confusion on the masses as people will become confused as to where they should pay their taxes, and to whom they should address their complaints.\n\nThe maintenance of the Departments as they are will provide stability and continuity."
   NFA_reopen_departmental_councils: "Reopen Departmental Councils"
   NFA_reopen_departmental_councils_desc: "The conseils généraux (General Councils) of the Departments have been shuttered since Le Retour, the regions being administered centrally from Marseille by the civil service at great burden. We should devolve power and hold new council elections for the metropolitan departments so that the civil service can focus on matters of national importance, not whatever Monsieur Flameux thinks about the litter collection being on Tuesdays instead of Wednesdays on his street."
   NFA_disarm_the_countryside: "Disarm the Countryside"
   NFA_disarm_the_countryside_desc: "A two step programme will be implemented to reduce the number of unregistered and illegal firearms in the countryside that are remnants of the Syndicalist Civil Defence plan. First of all, the state will offer to buy any firearm under amnesty for the next year, with rifles, anti-tank weapons, grenades and machine guns all having minimum prices at rates competitive to the international market. After that point, the amnesty will be rescinded and gendarmes will be permitted to investigate allegations of held weapons, with the full force of the law behind them."
   NFA_implement_the_franc_noveau: "Implement the "Franc Noveau""
   NFA_implement_the_franc_noveau_desc: "The French Republican Franc, our esteemed and somewhat ancient currency has been decimalised since 1795, and undergone many shifts in value since then. After the war, the value has slumped somewhat so that our citizens are regularly handing over hundreds of Francs for simple things like bread and razor blades.\n\nThe solution is simple. We will revalue the Franc as the 'Franc Nouveau' or 'New Franc' with an exchange rate of 100 to 1. This will slow inflation and reduce the need for vast quantities of paper currency being in circulation. It will also provide an opportunity to add new anti-falsification measures, and update the designs to reflect national pride."
   NFA_open_the_marseille_stock_exchange: "Open the Marseille Stock Exchange"
   NFA_open_the_marseille_stock_exchange_desc: "A true sign of the economic normalcy and growth of the country is the completion and readiness of the Marseille Stock Exchange to open its doors for trading. The establishment of the Marseille Stock Exchange signifies the development of a robust financial market in the region, offering a platform for companies and investors to trade stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.\n\nIt also shows that the region is shaking off the recent Syndicalist past and embracing its deeper, maritime tradition of trade and commerce that has gone on since the city's founding."
   NFA_support_small_businesses: "Support Small Businesses"
   NFA_support_small_businesses_desc: "We must encourage the entrepreneur class to be bold. By providing a line of credit to smaller businesses we can keep those that are sinking afloat, and keep those that are growing, on track. A rising tide lifts all boats, and by helping small businesses grow to become larger businesses, everyone ultimately profits."
   NFA_use_our_colonial_workforce: "Use Our Colonial Workforce"
   NFA_use_our_colonial_workforce_desc: "Many hands make for light work, and there are plenty of idle young men in Algeria and Tunisia who could profit from coming to the metropole and putting their energies to good use. We will start a scheme whereby these (and other colonial workers) will be given passage and assurances of work upon their arrival on the mainland, so that we might divert them from whatever they do to fill their time instead of being productive."
   NFA_work_with_the_new_notables: "Work With the New Notables"
   NFA_work_with_the_new_notables_desc: "Between the elections of the conseils généraux and the new entrepreneurs, there is a new and vibrant class of people who have attained an importance in the affairs of the Republic. These people must be worked with, and by doing so we will smooth our future into one of prosperity.\n\nThese people must also be introduced to the 'Grands Colons' of Algeria and Tunisia, that they might make meaningful business connections and shorten the distance between France's integral parts."
   NFA_expand_the_autoroutes: "Expand the Autoroutes"
   NFA_expand_the_autoroutes_desc: "Transportation and logistics are key to the smooth running of any state. Yet we still have single lane roads connecting the vast majority of the country both in the metropole and outremer. Any requirement for a vast movement of people or goods can be delayed by a junction with a stop-sign against a priority road. We must widen the roads, add more lanes, multiple carriageways and roundabouts, so that traffic might flow unimpeded."
   NFA_return_to_economic_normalcy: "Return to Economic Normalcy"
   NFA_return_to_economic_normalcy_desc: "It is a small miracle, but it is quite obvious. Things are back to normal, in economic terms. Prices rise and fall to meet the terms of supply and demand. The currency is strong enough that those with the means can consider a holiday abroad without paying a small fortune, or that their savings will become worthless halfway through the week. The shadow of the command economy has been dispelled."
   NFA_new_public_housing_programs: "New Public Housing Programs"
   NFA_new_public_housing_programs_desc: "Concrete is cheap! As are labourers, with the new passage programme across the Mediterranean bringing many young men to the metropole looking for work. So the state will put them to work, building towerblocks of the new wonder material and reviving the cities of the south, that are still littered with bullet holes and the scars of war."

### Old Tree ###
NFA_third_year_of_reconstruction: "Third Year of Reconstruction"
NFA_third_year_of_reconstruction_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the dastardly Commune of France in 1945 we've slowly been rebuilding the parts of France under our control, but rebuilding a country scarred by syndicalism has taken time. While we do not know when the emotional wounds of the war will be healed, we must strive to rebuild the country to put our best foot forward."
NFA_organizing_the_first_mendes_government: "Organizing the First Mendes Government"
NFA_organizing_the_first_mendes_government_desc: "With the recent election of [NFA.GetLeader] as president and the recent end to the Second Weltkrieg, we have been unable to formally create a government. Now that the dust has settled over the British Isles and the Totalist terror has subsided, we can begin to focos on domestic issues. The first order of business? Establish the President's new cabinet."
NFA_implement_dirigism: "Begin Implementing Dirigism"
NFA_implement_dirigism_desc: "While Dirigism is not a new concept for France, Bertrand de Jouvenel's plans for it involve a more hands-on approach than the version implemented under the Pétain regime. With input a variety of members from both the National Assembly and Senate, this plan is seen by many as the easiest way to demobilize and slowly ease back to a civilian economy."
NFA_found_the_SNCF: "Found the SNCF"
NFA_found_the_SNCF_desc: "The Commune's merger of the different railroads across France allowed them to more easily build and manage rail traffic. By taking a page out of their book, we should create a state-owned national rail company to not only streamline freight and passenger service across France, but to also standardize operating procedure and equipment.

NFA_our_place_in_the_accord_desc: "For the longest time we have played the second fiddle to Canada. With the reformation of Britain and the Italian peninsula reunified, we must ensure that we are not overlooked or underestimated by our allies.\n\nWe are going to have to pull hard, so that we will be respected, and not submerged, now that the old Entente has become the new Accord."
NFA_protector_of_the_mediterranean: "Protector of the Mediterranean"
NFA_protector_of_the_mediterranean_desc: "While we have allies in the Mediterranean, the sea is still mostly patrolled by our craft, it's skies traversed by our airplanes and our brave soldiers defending it. There are also a great deal of civilian ships crossing the ocean between Oran, Alger and Marseille\n\nWe should therefore perhaps formally stake a claim for responsibility towards the region, that we intend to protect the Mediterranean for the Accord and for civilisation. At least in the West. A strong ally by the Pillars of Hercules, ready to finish the job in Europe."
NFA_trade_agreements_with_our_allies: "Secure Trade Agreements with our Allies"

Focus on the Canadian market in pursuit of direct inflow of foreign investment? Seek to project French soft-power by courting nations that have not yet joined the Accord?\n\nUltimately a decision will have to be made, so that the government can advise the industrialists how to focus their efforts when looking to get into foreign markets."

NFA_in_canadas_shadow_desc: "Canada promised to help us reclaim France at the Halifax Conference. They managed to reclaim Britain during the war, and no doubt they will channel their energies into restoring their former homeland.

NFA_algiers_conference_desc: "The matter of the Colonies cannot be put off, distracted from or disregarded any longer. It is obvious that we must call together those who will speak with us, and come to a conclusion about how we wish to approach the future. For a long time, the French Republic has clung on the soil of North Africa. Now we return to the metropole, but it is obvious we cannot resume 'Colonialism as Usual'.

NFA_the_Algerian_matter: "The Algerian Matter"
NFA_the_Algerian_matter_desc: "The issue of Algeria is perhaps the most pressing. The movement there is most politically conscious, they have leaders such as Messali Hadj, Ferhat Abbas and Bachir Ibrahimi who are charismatic and brave in their own right, and they have a sense of national identity that threatens their long term integration with France.\n\nSimultaneously pieds-noirs such as Raymond Lequiére and Alain d'Serigny who make up a vocal part of the white minority in the territory are deeply desirous of maintenance of the status quo with regard to their political and social relation to the Muslim majority.\n\nFinally - Algeria was declared an integral part of France in 1848. Algeria IS France. To re-evaluate this position will require much political leg-work. If one considers this issue like a disease then the treatment may threaten the patient as much as leaving the matter unattended would."
NFA_the_African_veteran_pension_fund: "The African Veteran Pension Fund"
NFA_the_African_veteran_pension_fund_desc: "The matter of the pensions of African veterans is one that blood has been spilt over. Senegalese Tirailleurs were shot by regular troops after they were demobilised during the Weltkrieg, and the firearms were turned on them when they protested in 1946 in the Massacre at Thiaroye. Therefore the matter should be taken with serious consideration and understanding that the continued recalcitrance on this matter in our part is going to earn us further trouble, stir nationalist sentiment and hurt our reputaton in West Africa further.\n\nPerhaps it is best to settle the matter quietly? Rather than carry on here?"
NFA_redifining_the_empire: "Redefining the Empire"
NFA_redifining_the_empire_desc: "The French Colonial Empire has been our bread and butter for many years. But we still cleave to the Republican ideal, how can we therefore stand ourselves over our fellow men?\n\nIt is almost the dark humour of the American Declaration that all men are born equal, while their founding fathers held slaves.\n\nSome kind of change must be made, where we look the people who live here in the eye, reach out our hand, and treat them as an equal."

#french Union
NFA_fulfilling_the_mission_civilisatrice: "Fulfilling the Mission Civilisatrice"
NFA_fulfilling_the_mission_civilisatrice_desc: "The failure of the French Colonial Empire was that it persisted in maintaining a situation wherein there were distinct social classes based on ethnic and linguistic background.\n\nNo more. The French Union will fulfil the civilizing mission of it's failed predecessor, and create the means by which all will be true citizens of France. When all are on the level playing field, then those with merit will rise to the top, and those who are without will sink. As they should."
NFA_create_local_legislatures: "Create Local Legislatures"
NFA_create_local_legislatures_desc: "We cannot call ourselves a Union if all decisions for the Colonies are taken centrally by offices in Alger and Marseille.\n\nInstead we will create legislative bodies in the relevant territorial areas, and have them stand as the first port of call for requests, petitions and decisions. This will ease the burden on the civil service, and simultaneously allow us to proceed with increasing representation inside the state apparatus of the formerly colonial peoples."
NFA_expand_french_schooling: "Expand French Schooling"
NFA_expand_french_schooling_desc: "Presently vast budgets are spent on building schools and buildings to be used exclusively by the white minority in places such as Algeria. In other places, the schools do not exist due to a lack of funds.\n\nThis must be overturned, with the majority who are able to being brought into the French educational system. They must understand, and learn if they are to ever assimilate as evolués.\n\nOf course, the history textbooks will still start with the phrase 'Our ancestors, the Gauls'..."
NFA_integrate_Catholic_missions: "Integrate Catholic Missions"
NFA_integrate_Catholic_missions_desc: "The Catholic Missions have always served to inform the populations of places such as the Senegambia and West Africa of the benefits of taking proper care of their health, family planning and of education. That education has always been measured by the involvement of the state to provide the understanding of the benefits of assimilation and the status of being an 'évolué'.\n\nNow the time has come for the formal inclusion of the work done by the missions into the state, as they have significant overlap with state bodies."
NFA_abolish_the_Indigenat: "Abolish the Indigenat"
NFA_abolish_the_Indigenat_desc: "Since the deposition of Hussein Bey in Algeria in 1830 the term indigène has been used to describe the people there who were not considered French. By 1889 that mark was established exclusively toward the Muslim majority in the colony, with the droit du sol (right of the soil) being denied to them but no others. Additionally the Indigenat had become a tool of legal separation, allowing specific penalties and regulation against the Muslim majority, to the advantage of the pieds-noirs white minority, inclusive of summary punishment.\n\nIf we are to retrieve the situation we must therefore block summary punishment, extend citizenship and allow the children of people who are born on the territory to be French citizens.\n\nThis will be somewhat unpopular on both sides of the spectrum in Algeria - while the UDMA and Ferhat Abbas will be pleased, many prefer being governed by the Sharia system. The conservative pieds-noirs will of course see it as an abrogation of their prerogatives. But it is necessary if we are to retain any hope of peace."
NFA_elevate_native_elites: "Elevate Native Elites"
NFA_elevate_native_elites_desc: "If we are ever going to succeed in convincing the people of our honest intention, it must be by sitting at the same table and discussing with them as equals.

Rather we will include them as we do all other French citizens, and hopefully our elite society and theirs will equalise at a higher level."
NFA_integrate_colonial_units: "Integrate Colonial Units"

The French Community and the Union of Nations will approach their fellow man in the former colonial empire as an equal, and remove the oppressive stink of it's failed predecessor.

NFA_protect_settlers_property: "Protect Settler Property"
NFA_protect_settlers_property_desc: "Amongst the settlers there is a stalking terror that with our withdrawal of oppressive actions, the native people of the colonised lands will seek their revenge for past injustices. We must ensure that the process to autonomy is amicable and smooth both for the colonised and the former colonisers. Many will chafe against this, the agitated radicals seeking their moment of blood, and the imperious colon forced to acknowledge his fellow man as equal, will both be alike for a moment in their disappointment.\n\nNonetheless, it is a vital step."
NFA_promulgate_the_unions_constitution: "Promulgate the New Constitution"
NFA_promulgate_the_unions_constitution_desc: "With the promulgation of the New Constitution, the French Republic will become the French Union of Nations (Union française des nations). This is not a centralist, unitary ideal as was previously proposed but rather the reflection of the autonomist movements within the borders of what was formerly the French Colonial Empire and is now our 'Commonwealth', much like that of the British."

NFA_associate_with_local_parties: "Associate with Local Parties"
NFA_associate_with_local_parties_desc: "A key ingredient in a healthy democracy is a broad spectrum of views.

NFA_colonial_development_plan_desc: "Despite the landfall of French troops in Europe three years ago and the feverish development of new capacity in the South, the bureaucrats in the Office of Industrial Development in Alger have continued their efforts and plans. After many years of industrialisation and buildup in preparation for the glorious war to retake the Metropole, they have grown used to a certain slice of the budget, and they now present the choices to the leadership.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Algiers Conference, there have been steps to revalorise the position of the working native included in the plan, a concept which has not escaped notice."
NFA_the_north_shore: "The North Shore"

NFA_increase_tourism_to_north_africa: "Increase Tourism to North Africa"
NFA_increase_tourism_to_north_africa_desc: "With the ascent of the jet airliner, it has become easier than ever to go abroad.

NFA_buildup_tunisia: "Build-Up Tunisia"
NFA_buildup_tunisia_desc: "Ally since the 1881 Treaty of Bardo, Tunisia stands a proud and distinct part of our dominion in Africa.

NFA_promote_franco_tunisian_culture: "Promote Franco-Tunisian Culture"
NFA_promote_franco_tunisian_culture_desc: "The Bey may rule and his officers may call themselves Tunisian, but there are pieds-noirs in Tunisia as well as there are in Algeria.

As the Chief of the French Army during the invasion of Southern France, his expertise prooved vital in securing the territory we currently administrate. As such, many in the government and Army are pushing for his promotion to Marshal of France."
NFA_restructure_the_army: "Restructure the Army"
NFA_restructure_the_army_desc: "Now that we've finished organizing our government, we can now focus on the restructuring of our Army. Woefully outdated and unchanged since the days of the First Weltkrieg, our army stands no chance in a modern conflict."
NFA_follow_the_canadian_model: "Follow the Canadian Model"
NFA_follow_the_canadian_model_desc: "Canada's recent modernization programs have worked well for them and as the Accord's second-in-command it makes the most sense for us to follow their model. By standardizing the two strongest armies in the Accord, the other members should follow suit."
NFA_import_canadian_rifles: "Import Canadian Rifles"
NFA_import_canadian_rifles_desc: "While our civilian industry has mostly recovered, our military industry is woefully ill-equiped to deal with our expanding army. By importing rifles from Canada we can streamline our adoption of their army model while also ensuring the supply of our forces."
NFA_our_own_structure: "Our Own Structure"
NFA_our_own_structure_desc: "While Canada's model would work well in their climate and geography, a French Army must be specialized to deal with the geography of Europe and Africa. By modernizing what we currently use we can become the true defenders of Accord interests in Europe."
NFA_standardize_the_MAS_47: "Standardize the MAS 49"
NFA_standardize_the_MAS_47_desc: "Our current rifle, the MAS 49, is being produced in slightly different ways by each of factories that produce them which has led to some confusion from both officers and soldiers alike. While the rifle itself functions the same, the minor differences in appearance and material have led to many cases of \"That's my rifle not yours!\" and we need to put an end to it."
NFA_expand_the_marine_corps: "Expand the Marine Corps"
NFA_expand_the_marine_corps_desc: "The Marine Corps served as the vanguard during the invasion by helping establish beachheads and solidifying the frontlines for the regular troops. Since then. however, they've been left as the ugly duckling of our troops."
NFA_reorganize_the_troupes_de_marine: "Re-organize the Troupes de Marine"
NFA_reorganize_the_troupes_de_marine_desc: "The Troupes de Marine currently serve as our colonial troops, however with the expansion of the Marine Corps the name may confuse many. As such, the proposed name of \"Troupes d' Outre-Mer\" has begun to make the rounds around the colonies and the higher-ups in the Army. With this rebranding, however, has brought up the issue of the pension plan promised to them during the War which has caused a stir among the members of the National Assembly."
NFA_grant_the_pensions: "Grant the Pensions"
NFA_grant_the_pensions_desc: "There's no reason to continue to anger the colonies and as such, we should grant the overseas troops their promised pensions. This will, however, prove to be unpopular with members of the National Assembly and the higher-ups in the Army."
NFA_ignore_their_demands: "Ignore their Demands"
NFA_ignore_their_demands_desc: "The ongoing ruckus about pensions is just another case of greedy colonials putting their hands out and expecting something from the metropole while doing precious little in return. It is a pointless exercise to contemplate capitulation to their demands. We should just ignore the matter."

### National Spirits ###
NFA_return_to_mainland: "Return to the Mainland"
NFA_return_to_mainland_desc: "After over 25 years in exile, we have reclaimed the mainland and re-established the French 3rd Republic. While our journey home was not the smoothest, it has brought enthusiasm to those in our government and popularity for the government among people.\n\nHowever, there is much to be done. While desyndicalization proceeds and the people are once again becoming comfortable with liberal democracy, reactionary elements are still nacent in our government and work to see the military return to power.\n\nMeanwhile, the Germans lurk above us, waiting to strike at any moment and push us into the sea. While we have returned to the mainland, the work is only half finished. Vive la France!"
NFA_road_to_recovery: "The Road to Recovery"
NFA_road_to_recovery_desc: "While recovery has been fairly quick compared to the north of France, our economy is still not where it needs to be. Destruction from Entente and Reichspakt strategic bombing runs as well as the invasion itself has left many homeless and out of work.\n\nThe syndicalist economy left behind by the Commune has meant that this is not simply a rebuilding effort, but a retooling effort. Private enterprise must be reintroduced slowly so not to leave too few with too much. Lastly, the decapitation of Paris from our Republic has meant that Marseille must be built up as a hub that it never needed to be before."
NFA_political_deadlock: "Political Deadlock"
NFA_political_deadlock_desc: "While France has hardly ever not suffered from political deadlock, this particular iteration is particularly pronounced. With reconstruction well underway, the center right Parti Républicain Démocrate and the left wing Union Socialiste Républicaine are both threatening to leave the Parti Radical alone and without a coalition. Prime Minister Mendes France must choose which to collaborate with as he embarks on his new agenda."
NFA_colonial_unrest: "Colonial Unrest"
NFA_colonial_unrest_desc: "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, our colonies in North Africa have been experiencing renewed unrest. While it has cooled down during the war as young men were off at the front and reformers hoped that a French victory would mean greater autonomy, those hopes have not been fulfilled and African unrest has grown to new heights. We must find new solutions to this turmoil, or we may lose Africa forever."

### Events ###

krg_nfa.1.t: "The French Republic in 1948"
krg_nfa.1.d: "The Provisional Government of the French Republic, or the GPRF in French, leads the French Republic as a transitional government between Mordacq's CSN authoritarian state to a true democracy. Paul Reynaud is the current figurehead of the government after Joseph Goislard de Monsabert's tenure as head from the liberation of Marseille until mid 1947. With the foundations of the Republic settled, the government has called for elections later in the year with three main political parties choosing to run – The Parti républicain-socialiste, the Parti Radical, and the Union Démocratique Chrétienne.\n\nThe colonies are demanding recompense for their efforts during the period since the revolution and during the Second Weltkrieg, and the new government has to deal with a resurgence in syndicalist violence, despite the occupation having already lasted three years..."
krg_nfa.1.a: "Liberté, Egalité, et Fraternité!"

krg_nfa.2.t: "La Maladie"
krg_nfa.2.d: "It is an open secret, and one that cannot be avoided or ignored much longer. The population especially among the lower, working classes, turns to drink in excess to soothe the pain of their lost utopia. While the socialists fed them a great deal of nonsense, they did make measurable improvements in living standards for those who were poorest amongst us prior to the First Weltkrieg.\n\nTheir revolution has been crushed by German Armour and Colonial Marines, and while they do not seek to dismember or overthrow the government, many ache for what they perceive as a loss. They do not understand, but they know they are hurt, so they numb themselves with the bottle. This is not going to be something we can fix quickly." 
krg_nfa.2.a: "La guerre, la douleur, le regret..."

krg_nfa.3.t: "The Retirement"
krg_nfa.3.d: "Many of our generals and admirals are frankly of such an age that their more relevant combat experiences are starting to be decades behind them. While they led with distinction in the Second Weltkrieg, it has become clear with the new Kaltekrieg that while they might wish to contribute via political or domestic means, the general staff and the admiralty need fresh blood, and slightly fewer men in charge in total.\n\nNow these old grizzled veterans and sea dogs can collect their pensions and enjoy the fruits of what they have fought so hard for." 
krg_nfa.3.a: "Your Service Will Be Remembered."

krg_nfa.4.t: "Camus publishes La Peste (The Plague)"
krg_nfa.4.d: "After a paper shortage delayed publication by six months, Albert Camus has published a novel. Entitled 'La Peste', the book centres on a fictional plague that takes place in the city of Oran.\n\nAs the city is swept by disease, the people fall into individualistic miseries before pulling together collectively. Additionally the city government is depicted as slow to act until it is too late, then as obstructive toward a character who seeks to flee and meet his wife in Marseille. However, the general tone of the tale is not really for or against any real person, instead focusing on the events relating to the characters and their interactions with the world, as per his usual style." 
krg_nfa.4.a: "This isn't political commentary, mm?"

krg_nfa.5.t: "Camus publishes L'Homme Révolté (The Rebel)"
krg_nfa.5.d: "Camus has published a book length essay called 'The Rebel'. A simple summary of the piece is 'A slave who has taken orders all his life suddenly decides that he cannot obey some new command.'\n\nThe book is essentially a treatise against political revolution, with his statement that the true rebel seeks to right injustice, and does not seek to overthrow the existing order but rather reform it. This has provoked several figures to write critical or scathing attacks about the book, and it seems Camus may have misjudged the mood, especially given current events in Algeria." 
krg_nfa.5.a: "At least he's not advocating Rebellion!"

krg_nfa.7.t: "France offers economic aid"
krg_nfa.7.d: "The French Republic have, in the spirit of Accordist fraternity, sent us some economic aid.\n\nIt is not much, but it is better than nothing, as the saying goes."
krg_nfa.7.a: "Accept their offer"
krg_nfa.7.b: "We have to decline"

krg_nfa.8.t: "London accepts our offer"
krg_nfa.8.d: "The British Government sends their thanks for our aid, and wishes for the day that once again we can trade as equal partners.\n\nThey owe us one, as the saying goes."
krg_nfa.8.a: "Excellent."

krg_nfa.9.t: "London rejects our offer"
krg_nfa.9.d: "Despite our kind shipment of aid, the British government is apparently too good, or too fearful of giving away a favour, to be having our aid.\n\nWe have barely had the ink dry on the paperwork and this Accord already feels fragile, at least where we are concerned."
krg_nfa.9.a: "Perfidious Albion!"

krg_nfa.10.t: "President Sarrault’s Speech"
krg_nfa.10.d: "Before a gathered group of French citizens and reporters, President Albert Sarrault gave a pre-planned speech that covered a variety of topics and issues throughout the French Republic, and his efforts to address them.\n\nWhile the speech was received with little controversy, it has not stopped Sarrault's rivals and opposition from leaping on several statements made that they see as objectionable, and attempting to paint the President as a radical or incompetent figure. It remains to be seen if these efforts will cause a shift in support for the President, but so far it does not appear likely."
krg_nfa.10.a: "Not bad."

krg_nfa.11.t: "Deciding our Trade Policy"
krg_nfa.11.d: "While the French Republic is built on a pillar of independence, our willingness to stand up to the German tyrants has left our economy with limited options. By rejecting the Mitteleuropa terms originally agreed upon in the Halifax Conference, we have closed many doors when it comes to European trade. It is important to note that France has options and our fast growing economy is both ready to export and in dire need of import in order to outpace the northern pretenders. But our resources are finite and we must choose a locus by which we define our trade policy for the next decade. To that end, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has delivered three options to focus our trade policy: Europe, North America, or to explore opportunities beyond our Accord allies.\n\nEurope and the Mediterranean have been the bread and butter of French trade for centuries, and our lifeblood during the exile. While war has ravaged the continent, recovery has been swift and the damage may allow us to leverage better deals than our limited resources may allow. Britain, Spain, and Italy will be our primary trade partners, and we can possibly explore options like Greece, Egypt, and Danubia as well.\n\nOur allies in the New World, primarily Canada and New England, are eager to open new trade opportunities with us; particularly in regard to their Montgomery Plan. This provides many great opportunities to us, like industrial and pharmaceutical imports at a bargain due to their vested interest in keeping Marseille as a bulwark against the Reichspakt. But are we so desperate that we must put all of our eggs in the basket of former colonies?\n\nFinally may attempt to seek new markets beyond the Accord. There are many developing nations in the Pacific and Middle East that may be eager to exchange their strategic resources for our surplus military equipment. These regimes may be less stable and wealthy, but their desperation may give us far more leverage against what they have to offer in return.\n\nNo matter which locus we choose, our economy is sure to benefit. It is now only a matter of which best suits our administration’s goals for reunifying France."
krg_nfa.11.a: "Focus on countries closer to us"
krg_nfa.11.b: "Focus on North America"
krg_nfa.11.c: "Broaden our trade outside of the Accord"

krg_nfa.12.t: "Marseille's Response to the Attacks"

krg_nfa.14.t: "French Aid Arrives!"
krg_nfa.14.d: "We have received confirmation that the anticipated aid from France has arrived, and is already being distributed to the appropriate locations. The aid is a welcome development, which we will quickly use to benefit our countrymen.\n\nWe have sent our thanks to the French government, along with the hope that we will continue this positive relationship."

krg_nfa.20.d: "When it became obvious that the Germans were going to take Paris, the Communard Admiralty commanded the Mediterranean Fleet to concentrate at Marseille and scuttle the ships in order to disrupt commercial shipping into the port, and to stop the Communard navy falling into German or Republican hands.\n\nSince then these ships have sat in the harbour at Marseille, aside from a few that were destroyed in order to clear a pathway for shipping into the port once more.\n\nGiven the hurried nature of the scuttling, it is possible we would be able to refloat some of the ships and put them to work once again, though they would be of war era vintage, they could perhaps be refurbished."

nfa_colonial.1.t: "The Algiers Conference"
nfa_colonial.1.d: "In an event that has been anticipated by all of France, the Accord, and the world since the return to the mainland in 1946, French political, colonial, and military leaders met in Algiers this week. While discussions of specific groups and colonies were kept to a minimum, certain African representatives were invited. Discussion was narrowed down to two separate doctrines for the next stage of French rule over Africa.\n\nThe first, argued for by the Parti Social Francais, the Parti Républicain Démocrate, as well as some factions of the Parti Radical aims to fulfill the Mission Civilisatrice, pledging to turn all Africans into proper Frenchmen by expanding Catholic missions and French schooling across French Africa. They would use a carrot and stick approach towards local elites, colonial garrisons, and the Indigenat to fully integrate Africa into the French Republic. While an aggressive and perhaps an outdate mode of colonialism, those on the right argue that this is the only way to ensure native loyalty in the long term.\n\nThose on the left in the Union Socialiste Républicaine and Parti Radical argue the opposite. A civilization mission would only anger the natives, and would surely lead to revolt, which France cannot afford. Instead, they propose a French Community, whereby the regions of French Africa would be granted autonomy in exchange for a much smaller exchange of taxes and services. A much narrower range of natives would be eligible for conscription and the regulation of local economies would be subject to local officials rather than Marseille. Opponents of this movement argue that this would only foster native national identities and would cause an inevitable cascade of declarations of independence ten or twenty years down the line.\n\nWhatever the decision, this is a monumental week in French history."
nfa_colonial.1.a: "We must reform the Empire."

nfa_colonial.2.t: "The African Pension Fund"
nfa_colonial.2.d: "Many of the hardy tirailleurs are complaining that despite putting in their service and quitting now that the war is completed and returning to their homes, that their pensions have not been paid. Many wounded veterans are especially aggrieved, and claim that their contracts promised rather hefty sums.\n\nWhile they are correct, if we actually started to pay them out, the Republic's fragile economic development would be shaken. Rebuilding the metropole, and developing Marseille is not done on a shoestring after all... Or rather, it will have to be, if we pay everything we owe right now."
nfa_colonial.2.a: "We must give them their full pensions."
nfa_colonial.2.b: "Give them a more reasonable amount."

nfa_colonial.3.t: "The Algerian Citizenship Question"
nfa_colonial.3.d: "'The Indigenat' refers to a code of laws in place in Algeria since the Crèmieux decrees of 1870. While there are many details, the key one is that while all other groups on the territory who obey French law have the right of the soil, to be born in France and thus be French, the Algerian Muslim majority do not. They have instead the status of French Subject.\n\nThey can apply for citizenship, though the pieds-noirs who run the offices tend to drag their feet, and there is a sticking point about which court of law they would be tried by. Many Algerians do not wish to be subjected to secular law, despite all other claims toward citizenship. One of the major issues is that for 4.5 million Algerians there are currently only 279 administrators.\n\nThe primary path here would be to relax some boundaries, hire some indigenous clerks, thus bolstering the administration and perhaps taking a broom to those intransigent adminstrators who remain if needed. That's the best that can be done in the short term."
nfa_colonial.3.a: "We will ease applications for citizenship."
nfa_colonial.3.b: "There is no need for changes."

nfa_colonial.4.t: "Status of Tunisia"
nfa_colonial.4.d: "With the goal of the French Union comes the question of what is to be done with Tunisia. The Protectorate of the Beylik has been in place since the signing of the Treaty of Bardo in 1881, and while the senior posts on the Bey's government have (with the exception of the recently ended Chenik government of Moncef Bey) been ran by Frenchmen, the local level of administration and governance is a wholly Tunisian affair.\n\nTherefore while we functionally control Tunisian foreign and military policy, it remains a land apart within our borders. We already have a great task ahead of us, perhaps it would be best if Tunisia was not added to the list of things to do?"

nfa_colonial.14.b: "L'Algerie c'est France!"

nfa_colonial.15.t: "Redefining the Empire"
nfa_colonial.15.d: "While we lack Paris, our French Republic still remains the sole inheritor of France’s vast empire of colonial holdings. Africa sheltered us during the red storm of the revolution. Africa fed us during our long exile. And Africa supplied us with the tools and resources we needed to defeat the Syndicalists and retake the Metropole. Alas, the land that has been our home for decades and our domain for centuries has begun to slip from our grasp. International pressure, particularly from our Accord allies, has made it difficult to treat our colonial holdings in a favorable status quo. Furthermore, unrest from our subjects has been exacerbated by sabotage from our enemies. But France has known the winds of change and we know how to sail with them. It is time we redefine our empire.\n\nThe exact course we navigate, however, has been hotly debated. Socialists and sympathizers within our borders want us to completely divest from Africa, but we are loath to admit that the resources and labor that it provides are too much to lose while Germany props up a pretender in our fair Paris. France is the bulwark of the Accord and our border will be the first to go hot if this kalterkreig escalates in Europe. The more sensible members of our government have come up with two plans on how to retain our influence in Africa while appeasing the critics at home and abroad: The French Union and the French Community.\n\nThe French Community is a plan firmly entrenched in the Parti Radical. It plans to reorganize our colonial empire into a federation of autonomous African states in partnership with the French Republic. Members of the French Community would be able to manage their internal affairs while nominally remaining part of the French Republic. The Community would have a representative in the French Senate while member states would cooperate through constituent assemblies.\n\nThe French Union plan asserts that France has no colonial holdings but is one single nation of Frenchmen. This would be achieved by completing the Mission Civilisatrice by enforcing French culture and language through religious missions, education funding, and collaboration with African elites. Fully integrating the colonies as overseas departments of France is backed by PSF, but has moderate support from Parti Radical members as well. The centralization of the French Union would center around a President, High Council, and Assembly. In theory, all members of the French Union would be citizens of France which would make our Republic one of the largest and most populous countries in the world."

nfa_colonial.15.b: "French Union"

nfa_colonial.16.t: "The Induction of the First Senate of the Union"
nfa_colonial.16.d: "Today marks a momentous occasion as the first Senate of the Union was inducted today. Representatives from the Council of the Republic and National Assembly made up the majority of the Senate representatives with a modest turnout from the assembly of overseas departments. The deliberations of the Senate, held in Marseilles, were discussed completely in French and in accordance with French democratic custom. The topics of the day included development of France’s vast untapped resources, French education expansion, and Catholic church funding.\n\nSome representatives of the French Overseas Departments brought up rising tensions within their departments as the implementation of the Union has not been received as well as they hoped. But those problems were deemed small in the face of the vast needs of France’s resource development programs. There is progress to be made and a Mission Civilisatrice to be completed, and the energy in the room has made the members of the senate feel invincible."
nfa_colonial.16.a: "We are all Frenchmen!"

nfa_colonial.17.t: "Protests in Sétif"
nfa_colonial.17.d: "Against the backdrop of the recent declaration of Victory in Europe, approximately five thousand Algerians marched in Sétif today. Many were holding banners protesting colonial rule, demanding that France relinquish control over the country to it's native population, and that settlers should return to their homelands in Europe, that just as France has been liberated, so too should be Algeria.\n\nWhen French gendarmes attempted to seize some of the protesting banners, the situation rapidly devolved into a gun-fight. Nobody knows who shot first, but both sides took wounded, radicals with firearms stalking among the more peaceful protestors in the crowd. News of this is already spreading, and there is French blood on Algerian soil once again."
nfa_colonial.17.a: "They will pay!"

nfa_colonial.18.t: "French Settlers Killed by Algerian Protesters"
nfa_colonial.18.d: "The news from Sétif reached the countryside faster than we could have anticipated, and the nationalists there have taken up arms in the name of Jihad and began a campaign of terror against the pieds-noirs in the region.\n\nWe are receiving reports of burned homes, gun-battles and even massacres of whole families. Approximately one-hundred Europeans have been killed so far, with approximately another hundred or so hurt.\n\nWe must act and forcefully! The Army and Foreign Legion are standing by to deploy to Sétif, as are the Colonial Police. Should we remind them who is in charge here? Or proceed in a more measured fashion."
nfa_colonial.18.a: "Rake them over! Send in the Legion!"
nfa_colonial.18.b: "This is still a police matter."

nfa_colonial.19.t: "Thousands of Algerians Killed in Reprisals"
nfa_colonial.19.d: "After five days of chaos, the Foreign Legion has 'raked over' the region around Sétif. The signs of summary executions by the Legionaries are evident and many villages resemble nothing so much as deserted ruins. Occasionally a curtain might twitch in a window, caught on the wind, as the Army cleans up the countryside. Less accessible villages were bombed by the airforce. Even conservative estimates put the death toll in the region into the thousands. In the villages wild dogs roam the streets, gnawing on the dead.\n\nAdditionally pieds-noirs vigilantes have shot a number of local Muslims, and lynched Muslim prisoners from the jails, who likely had nothing whatsoever to do with the events in Sétif. Prominent Algerian politician and assimilationist Ferhat Abbas was travelling at the time and was detained by Colonial Police despite having no proven link to the uprising."
nfa_colonial.19.a: "They started it!"

nfa_colonial.20.t: "Hundreds of Algerians Killed in Reprisals"
nfa_colonial.20.d: "After five days of chaos, the Colonial Police has managed to restore order to the countryside around Sétif. There were some gun-battles with die-hard nationalists and a few villages refused to stand down and now resemble deserted ruins after the Army was brought in to support the Colonial Police. On the whole though, the sitution has been contained with a minimum of bloodshed, though unfortunately hundreds have still been killed.\n\nAdditionally pieds-noirs vigilantes have shot a number of local Muslims, and lynched Muslim prisoners from the jails, who likely had nothing whatsoever to do with the events in Sétif. Prominent Algerian politician and assimilationist Ferhat Abbas was travelling at the time and was detained by Colonial Police despite having no proven link to the uprising."
nfa_colonial.20.a: "They started it!"

nfa_colonial.21.t: "The PSF Protests Government Inaction in Algeria"
nfa_colonial.21.d: "The government has come underfire for it's 'tolerant attitude to active attacks on French settlers in Algeria' by the Parti Social Français. Colonel De La Rocque is making a great deal of noise about the police's handling of matters in Sétif, and commenting that we are being too understanding and kind to an 'alien culture' that would 'see pieds-noirs hung by their feet and their throats slit'.\n\nThis is hurting the government's popularity somewhat, though many know it is just the Colonel being his usual self, there is also some concern that we will be seen as weak on the Colonial Question and this might presage further issues, or at least electoral losses.\n\nWe can always ignore the Colonel. Or we can be seen to be doing something, so we're still in power to control this transition."
nfa_colonial.21.a: "Let De La Rocque complain."
nfa_colonial.21.b: "Make an example of Sétif then."

nfa_colonial.22.t: "Further Reprisals in Algeria Kill Thousands"
nfa_colonial.22.d: "The Foreign Legion have been sent in to Sétif and the countryside surrounding it, and they have been merciless. Hundreds, if not thousands have been slaughtered in an indiscriminate roundup of Algerians meant to send a message to those who oppose France, and who interfere with pieds-noirs and their property.\n\nVillages stand deserted. The airforce bombed more remote villages who perhaps hadn't even realised what was occurring. The signs of summary executions are everywhere, in the countryside and in the villages wild dogs roam the streets, gnawing on the dead. \n\nThis is a savage act, a brutal monument to French strength and the use of force in the name of peace. The only peace here now is the peace of the grave."
nfa_colonial.22.a: "If blood is what it takes."

nfa_colonial.23.t: "Formation of the UDMA"
nfa_colonial.23.d: "The Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto (Union Démocratique du Manifeste Algérien) (UDMA) is a political party founded by Ferhat Abbas. Their goals are not exactly clear, but it appears that he has shifted his opinion away from assimilationism and instead seeks to court nationalist attention by pursuing autonomy within the the framework of an Algerian state that is an autonomous part of France.\n\nThe matter is not yet sealed or settled though, so perhaps with some evidence of the success of reform, we can convince him citizenship is still a viable path. Or we can at least use his autonomy plan as a deterrent to those who seek full independence."
nfa_colonial.23.a: "Let us hope we can convince them."

nfa_colonial.24.t: "Ferhat Abbas elected to the National Assembly"
nfa_colonial.24.d: "The UDMA's policy has struck a chord with the Algerian population - not only has Ferhat Abbas been elected to the National Assembly, but several of his colleagues from the UDMA have as well.\n\nIt appears we are going to have allies in the fight for reform in the colonies, and we will not have to fight the Colonel alone.\n\nOf course, we will now have the dual edged sword that our reform must be felt to be enough by Abbas and his confederates, while not being so outrageous as to destroy our own electoral base of support."
nfa_colonial.24.a: "Hopefully we can work together to reform."

nfa_colonial.25.t: "Formation of the Organisation Spéciale"
nfa_colonial.25.d: "It appears that the pace of reform isn't enough for some. We have received news of the formation of an organisation calling itself either the Organisation Spéciele or the Organisation Secret.\n\nEither way, this is an armed guerilla movement that is seeking redress for the events at Sétif and preparing for an armed struggle against the Republic for the liberation of Algeria. We will have to keep our ears to the ground to try and handle this matter, but it is a concerning sign that our attempts to manage the situation are spiralling out of control."

nfa_colonial.26.d: "Several members of the Organisation Spéciele today stuck up the Central Post Office in Oran. They managed to take 3 million francs of cash from the teller there. Their leader was identified by witnesses as one Ahmed Ben Balla. The gendarmes were not alerted to the matter until it was too late to give pursuit.\n\nWe should keep an eye out, it is likely this money will be used to fund OS's campaign against the French presence in Algeria."

nfa_colonial.27.t: "Formation of La Main Rouge?"
nfa_colonial.27.d: "The Organisation Spéciele and other movements in Tunisia and Algeria have their own terrorist paramilitaries. We should not be afraid to also operate under the veil. They seek to inspire fear in our people, we should return the favour. All is fair in war right? And this is a war of peace.\n\nThe proposal is for the formation of an organisation, primarily recruited among pieds-noirs, called La Main Rouge (The Red Hand) which would allow us to strike back against the FLN and the OS without having our hands dirty as a state. Plausible deniability is key."

Hached miraculously avoided injury and abandoned his vehicle, hiding in a trench by the side of the road.\n\nFrom his account, after some time a second group of men passed by in another car but when they were unable to find him, they departed.\n\nThere is outrage in some quarters of the political scene at this outright hit."

The neo-Destaur political party, and the Chenik government's status are currently up in the air, as Lamine Bey has yet to appoint his ministers, but already comments swirl that the new Bey is not the man his cousin was."

Once there, they committed brutal reprisals against the local population, slaughtering thousands of Algerians in retaliation.\n\nDue to the chaos engulfing the region and a military cordon in place, reporters have been unable to verify these reports but insiders have stated that the airforce bombed several remote villages, ships bombarded the shore from the Gulf of Bougie and that in the more accessible areas there are signs of summary executions everywhere. Some photographs have been been smuggled out, showing French soldiers standing in front of their victims.\n\nThe General commanding the operation stated to the French Press that 'I have secured you peace for 10 years'."

#"President Reynaud's Speech"
#"Notre-Dame de la Garde, a once proud symbol of Marseille, turned into the symbol of the Commune's tyranny over southern France. Its walls, covered with casings and bullet holes all around, and the blood spilled between our own people. The Commune first attacked this proud institution of Marseille, for it served as a symbol of the decadent Catholicism that ran rampant over France. Today however, it serves a new purpose. Cameras are spread all throughout its exterior, with the crowds mounting into the thousands as they wait for President Reynaud to give out his speech on the top of the double staircase - a clear message to show his willingness to be with the people.\n\n"Monsieur, it is time."\n\nReyanud walks towards the microphones, with the crowds cheering his arrival.\n\n"Ladies and Gentlemen, citizens of this great Republic, it is my pleasure to stand before you on this moment of our history. Long before, this structure was the symbol of not just this city, but the entirety of France as a whole. It is a part of our identity as a people, that the Commune has recklessly perverted it into a mere reconnaissance tower to end our armies' advances. The notion that a symbol of our identity can be casted aside into a mere watchtower is simply horrific and disgusting."\n\n"That is true for one of our greatest products we've created - Republicanism and Democracy. Much like this structure, the Commune burnt out the dream of Liberté, égalité, fraternité in exchange for "protecting the revolution", even if it means murdering our countrymen by the millions, even if it means to burn out liberty's light. Make no mistake, we will not yield nor compromise on the ideals of liberty in our Republic, and as such, I hereby proclaim new elections in October, with all political parties allowed to participate in this historic vote. The UDC, the Parti Radical, and the PRS have already announced their willingness to participate in this upcoming election. I will unfortunately not participate, for I am an old man who has grown tired and weak to run this Republic. It is time for a new face, a new generation, to lead a newer, stronger France.""
#"Vive La France, Vive La République!"

### Leader Descs ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_MENDEZ_FRANCE_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 11th, 1907\nParis, France\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn Pierre Isaac Isidore Mendès France to a family of Judeo-Portuguese origin, he has slowly become a trailblazer in French politics. After becoming the youngest lawyer in the French Republic at the age of 21 in 1928, he established himself as a force in the political world by writing his thesis on the Franc Recovery Policy under the Presidency of Raymond Poincaré. As the Pétain regime tried to consolidate itself through the early 1930s, PMF would become an outspoken critic of the regime.\n\nDuring the Second Weltkrieg he was drafted into the Air Force where he served as an aerial oberver for the early campaigns. During Operation Pegasus he was called back into service and his intelligence helped secure the Entente's victory on the first day.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Commune and the establishment of the Provisional Government he returned to civilian life as a member of the National Assembly. By mid-1947 he had established himself as one of the most ardent supporters of French Republicanism and of the current French government. Having served a key role in the writing of the new constitution and his popularity among National Assembly members, it was almost certain that he would run for the Premiership.\n\nNow serving as both Prime Minister and President of the Parti Radical, the young PM has much to prove to the more wary members of the electorate while still ensuring that France doesn't lose any prestige or credibility even as a shell of its former self.§!"
POLITICS_ALBERT_SARRAUT_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJuly 28th, 1872\nBordeaux, France\n§W--------------§!\nFirst elected in 1902, Albert Sarraut made a name for himself with his advocacy for laicite and adherence to negotiation in the face of crisis. His pre-Weltkrieg career took him quite literally across the world, from a series of minor cabinet posts to two largely unremarkable terms as the Governor of French Indochina. Recalled at the end of the war, Sarraut initially sympathised with the strikers. But he remained loyal with the Republican Government, trying fruitlessly to open up dialogues to calm the revolution. Fleeing to Algiers, he continued to take up increasingly important posts as the Republic fell into deeper and deeper crises. First Colonial Minister twice, and then Interior Minister in the fateful final government before Petain's coup, something he supported to save the nation.\n\nHis political apex came in 1937, when he served as Mordacq's Minister of State to check the influence of the ambitious PSF. In this post, he helped Mordacq stabilise the nation and though he resigned before the war began, he was still heavily respected for his efforts. Thus, the even-handed minister was a logical choice for the ascendant Radical's Presidential Candidate, willing narrowly and further driving the reactionary right towards Germany.\n\nSince reaching the largely ceremonial post, Sarraut has remained a steady hand. He's lobbied for reconciliation with former Communards, supported the broad alliance marshalled by Mendes France, and has quietly rivalled Colonel De La Rocque. But he proudly refuses to overstep his boundaries. If something is the will of Parliament, then it is the will of the French."
