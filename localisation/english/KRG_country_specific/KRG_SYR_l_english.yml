### National Spirits ###
SYR_Egyptian_Condemnation: "Egyptian Condemnation"
SYR_Egyptian_Condemnation_desc: "During a state visit in Cairo of democratically elected President, Shukri Al-Quwatli, General Sami Al Hinnawi couped the government and declared a state of emergency in 1941.\n\nSince then relations with the former ally in the Cairo Pact have been frosty, and Egypt harbours many who the Syrian government wished were not able to influence politics in the country still, such as Al-Quwatli, and Michal Aflaq."

SYR_SSNP_idea_2: "The State within a State"
SYR_SSNP_idea_2_desc: "The SSNP represent a State within a State under the leadership of the charismatic and illusive Antoun Saadeh. Whilst the organisation remains legal within Syria due to it's power base among the people, their political goals may ultimately lead them into conflict with Sami Al-Hinnawi or whoever else may come to power."

SYR_SSNP_idea: "The State within a State"

Whilst the organisation remains legal within Syria due to it's power base among the people, their political goals may ultimately lead them into conflict with Sami Al-Hinnawi or whoever else may come to power."


SYR_corruption: "Crippling Corruption"
SYR_corruption_desc: "The Sanjaks and Vilayets of Syria were never that wealthy to begin with, but still the leadership of Al-Hinnawi has led to even less bread on people's tables and more money in a certain circle's pockets."

SYR_discontent: "Growing Discontent"
SYR_discontent_desc: "A free people, under a democracy... until it was cruelly snatched away by another autocrat. The various peoples of Syria are not happy with their leaders, they do not believe that this is all life can be. They look to the future and they do not see Al-Hinnawi as their leader."

SYR_yishuv: "The New Yishuv"
SYR_yishuv_desc: "The dream of Theodor Herzl has come to pass, in a strange way. Still surrounded on all sides by the local Arabs, the Sanjak of Palestine - the former Ottoman Sanjak of Jerusalem, is nonetheless home to a significant number of Zionists, who cannot be ignored and who refuse to take up arms for Syria."

SYR_Baath_Idea: "The Renaissance"
SYR_Baath_Idea_desc: "The Ba'athist ideology advocates the enlightenment of the Arabs as well as the renaissance of their culture, values and society. It also advocates the creation of one-party states and rejects political pluralism in an unspecified length of time - the Ba'ath party theoretically uses an unspecified amount of time to develop an enlightened Arabic society. Ba'athism is based on the principles of Arab nationalism, pan-Arabism, and Arab socialism, as well as social progress. It is a secular ideology. A Ba'athist state supports socialist economics to varying degrees and it also supports public ownership of the commanding heights of the economy, but it opposes confiscatory policies with regard to private property. In Ba'athist ideology, socialism does not mean state-socialism or economic equality; rather, it has a strong current of modernization. Ba'athists contend that socialism is the only way to develop an Arab society which is free and united."

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_SAMI_AL_HINNAWI_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\n1898\nAleppo, Aleppo Vilayet, Ottoman Empire\n§W--------------§!\nSami al-Hinnawi studied at the Ottoman Military Academy in Istanbul, graduated with distinction in 1914, and joined the Ottoman Army in the first Weltkrieg. He defected from service in 1916 to become an officer in the rebel army of Sharif Husayn, who was leading an Arab Revolt against the Ottomans. When the Ottomans defeated the Arab Revolt, Sami Al Hinnawi fled to Egypt in 1920 and continued to fight relentlessly for the Arab cause from the underground. From the underground, Sami Al Hinnawi became acquainted with figures like Antoun Saadeh, Adib Shishakli and Husni Al Za'im.\n\nWhen the Desert War began, Hinnawi illustrated himself by leading the Syrian front in Palestine against the Ottomans, the Zionists and the International Gendarmerie. In 1939, Sami al-Hinnawi earned himself the nickname "The Lion of Al Quds" after inflicting a severe and humiliating defeat on the Ottomans in Jerusalem. In 1941, Sami Al Hinnawi and a clique of military officers overthrew the democratically elected president Shukri Al Quwatli and declared a state of emergency. Despite having been one of the most reluctant officers of the coup, Hinnawi was chosen to be the face of the new military government thanks to his distinguished status as a war hero and dedication to the Arab cause."

### Events ###
krg_syr.0.t: "The Kingdom of the Lion"
krg_syr.0.d: "As 1948 begins Sami Al-Hinnawi, while still working on the reconstruction of Syria, is trying to mediate between the Panarabs and the Syrian nationalists of the SSNP. In Syria where the influence of the SSNP is the strongest, dissenting opinions are met with violence and intimidation. In some sectors like the military administration, where the SSNP militias have been integrated, adherence to the party is mandatory.\nDespite being the face of the military junta and the commander of the army, the Lion of Al Quds does not rule as an unopposed autocrat within his government, the military junta is closer to a military oligarchy with Hinnawi as its strongman."
krg_syr.0.a: "All is not well..."

krg_syr.1.t: "The Lebanese Situation"
krg_syr.1.d: "In Lebanon after months of violence, the SSNP has been expelled, forcing the 'Supreme Commander' Antun Saadeh to take refuge in Damascus.\nWhile the lack of an SSNP presence in Lebanon is unfortunate given their closeness to the government, having Saadeh in Damascus also means that the viper's nest has moved closer to the seat of power. The SSNP, it cannot be underemphasised, IS the state in parts of Syria.\nThe Lion of Al-Quds must be wary of threats to his throne, as Adib Shishakli - his right hand, watches the maneuverings that he is forced to make to appease Saadeh."
krg_syr.1.a: "Best keep an eye on them both."

krg_syr.2.t: "Palestinian Matters"
krg_syr.2.d: "In Palestine, the SSNP never succeeded in becoming an influential political force. However, the influential Pan-Syrian and Pan-Arab "Al Nahda Al Filastiniyya" led by Izzat Darwaza, is working hand in hand with Hinnawi's government.\nYet, a significant number of Palestinian notables do not trust Hinnarwi or his people and have instead built close ties with the Lebanese and Egyptian merchant class, as well as with the Yishuv."
krg_syr.2.a: "A future battleground?"

krg_syr.3.t: "The Kurdish Borderlands"
krg_syr.3.d: "In Syrian Kurdistan, the government never managed to fully take control of the area without negotiating with the tribal chiefs. The situation there is aggravated by the porosity of the border between Syria, Turkey and Iraq. The Arabisation of Kurds in Iraq is currently leading to an influx of Kurdish immigrants, refugees and fighters in Syrian Kurdistan.\nIt seems like it will be awhile yet before the wild borderland can be tamed by the central government."
krg_syr.3.a: "What is to be done?"

krg_syr.4.t: "The Yishuv"
krg_syr.4.d: "In the Yishuv, the SSNP and the government have practically no control. Nevertheless, the Yishuv seeks to maintain relations with the Syrian government to avoid any potential confrontation with Syria and the rest of the Arab world. Furthermore, the relations between the Yishuv and the Arab notables in Palestine improved since the war ended.\nBecause of the introduction of modern medicine and the prosperity of the Yishuv, Palestine was the only region of Syria to see a decrease in infant mortality and even population growth during the Famine of 1940-1942. Foreign investments and immigration of college-educated Jews from Eastern Europe also helped the Yishuv urbanize Palestine."
krg_syr.4.a: "But they will not help us."

krg_syr.5.t: "A coup is afoot!"
krg_syr.5.d: "The Lion of Al-Quds has received information that his trusted right hand, Adib Shishakli has been plotting with Antoun Saadeh and the SSNP to overthrow him and bring in a new regime.\nThe claim is shocking to say the least, as Shishakli has been a loyal ally and friend of Sami Al-Hinnawi for a long time. However he does also have close connections to the SSNP, so the idea is not completely alien.\nWhat will Sami Al-Hinnawi do with this information?"
krg_syr.5.a: "This is ridiculous! Ignore it."
krg_syr.5.b: "Arrest Shishakli!"
krg_syr.5.c: "Arrest Shishakli and Saadeh!"
krg_syr.5.e: "We must be smart. Invite them to the palace."

krg_syr.6.t: "Coup d'état!"
krg_syr.6.d: "The Lion of Al-Quds was a fool, and now Sami Al-Hinnawi is imprisoned in his own palace. At 0700 this morning, the forces loyal to the Hero of the Independence War, Adib Shishakli, in the military junta with the aide of the SSNP seized the organs of state, including the broadcast studio of the Syrian National Broadcast Corporation and the Azm Palace where the President was.\nMost people seem to regard the situation as a changing of the guard in the Junta, with few new issues cropping up. What will happen to Al-Hinnawi? Well, there seems to be little concern about him among the Junta. Shishakli laid the groundwork for his coup well."
krg_syr.6.a: "Glory to the Heroes!"

krg_syr.7.t: "Shishakli Arrested!"
krg_syr.7.d: "Trusted members of the Syrian State Security today arrested the former right hand of the Lion of Al-Quds. Adib Shishakli is imprisoned in the Azm Palace, having being captured as he slept in his home.\nNot all has gone smoothly that nobody knows what has been done however, and we have already received reports that the Syrian Social Nationalist Party have taken up arms."
krg_syr.7.a: "Declare Martial Law."

krg_syr.8.t: "The SSNP Seize Power!"
krg_syr.8.d: "The SSNP militias, having spent the past few days provoking  considerable turmoil in Syria, today received their marching orders and converged on the organs of the state, seizing the Azm Palace where the President was and the Syrian National Broadcast Corporation studios. The Radio has been stating that the SSNP has taken control of the country, and in downtown Damascus and the Homs and Aintab regions, that seems to be the case\nIn the suburbs of Damascus however, not all has gone so smoothly, and we have already received reports that the Hizb Al Shahab have taken up arms in Aleppo.\nMeanwhile the areas of the country that were under tenuous government control have seized the opportunity to formally separate from Syrian government control."
krg_syr.8.a: "Looks like we have our work cut out for us."
krg_syr.8.b: "To arms, Ba'athists! (play as Ba'athist Syria)"

krg_syr.9.t: "Shishakli and Saadeh Arrested!"
krg_syr.9.d: "Trusted members of the Syrian State Security today arrested the former right hand of the Lion of Al-Quds, Adib Shishakli, and the 'Supreme Commander' of the SSNP, Antoun Saadeh. Both have been imprisoned in the Azm Palace, having being captured as they slept in their homes.\nNot all has gone so smoothly, and we have already received reports that the Syrian Social Nationalist Party have taken up arms."
krg_syr.9.a: "A hard fight ahead."

krg_syr.10.t: "A quiet discussion at the Azm Palace"
krg_syr.10.d: "When Sami Al-Hinnawi had Adib Shishakli and Antoun Saadeh visit him at the Azm Palace in Damascus, they were certain that the jig was up.\nAl-Hinnawi however, spoke to them calmly for several moments about the future of Syria, how he had hoped that he could form a state which would create the basis for a peace in the region, free of Turkish and European interference. His goal, he explained was to make Syria a great place to live, and that he had hoped that would not require further bloodshed.\nThen he..."
krg_syr.10.a: "Nodded to the guards, who arrested them both."
krg_syr.10.b: "Stated he would emigrate, and let them try instead."

krg_syr.11.t: "Exiled Baathists return from Egypt!"
krg_syr.11.d: "With the uprising against the state, those who had fled into exile in Egypt have returned via ships to the port at Latakia and are now already taking up arms. Some of them have used their time abroad well, and have been training in hidden camps in the desert."
krg_syr.11.a: "Welcome back brothers!"

krg_syr_news.0.t: "Change of the Guard in Syria"
krg_syr_news.0.d: "Through the circumstances of some kind of murky palace intrigue, the self-styled 'Lion of Al-Quds' - Sami Al-Hinnawi of the Syrian Republic is no longer in charge.\n\nInstead he's been replaced by his former right hand man, Adib Shishakli. What this means for the state, given it's tenuous status at the crossroads of many powers in the middle east and it's own internal dynamics, is unclear for now."
krg_syr_news.0.a: "Good luck? I suppose."

krg_syr_news.1.t: "Syria descends into Civil War!"
krg_syr_news.1.d: "Through the circumstances of some kind of murky palace intrigue, the self-styled 'Lion of Al-Quds' - Sami Al-Hinnawi of the Syrian Republic is no longer in charge.\n\nThe Syrian Socialist National Party - in some places practically the state already - have seized power in an action against the Azm Palace of the President in Damascus.\n\nAs a result, the many ethnic minorities in the territory of the Syrian Republic, along with the left wing Hizb Al Shabab, have risen up against this coup.\n\nHow this will end, nobody knows, but there is once again war in the desert."
krg_syr_news.1.a: "The mapmakers will be pleased."

krg_syr_news.2.t: "The Syrian Socialist National Party Triumph in Syria!"
krg_syr_news.2.d: "After a brutal campaign in the desert, the SSNP has managed to patch together the territorial boundaries of Syria.\n\nWith their charismatic leader [SYR.GetLeader] at the helm, one imagines their neighbours are quaking in their boots as to the ambitions of the red whirlwind for the Middle East."
krg_syr_news.2.a: "Interesting Times."

krg_syr_news.3.t: "The Ba'ath Party Triumph in Syria!"
krg_syr_news.3.d: "After a brutal campaign in the desert, the Ba'ath Party has managed to patch together the territorial boundaries of Syria.\n\nWith their charismatic leader [BSY.GetLeader] at the helm, one imagines their neighbours are quaking in their boots as to the ambitions of the Pan-Arab Syndicalist party for the Middle East."
