DNF_nationalist_tensions_1: "Tensions within the Federation"
DNF_nationalist_tensions_1_desc: "Our Federal system isn't one beloved by everyone, and how can it be. The Danubian Federation is made up of seven nations, each with their own culture and ethnic issues, and that isn't including the additional nationalities that lack their own nation, like the Slovenians & Ukrainians. Across Danubia, there is a slew of nationalist movements which seek to pounce on any instabilities or inadequacies the Federation encounters. It is therefore imperative that we keep their destabilising influence at a minimum, through appeasing their membership and ensuring the Federation runs smoothly and inclusively. Our diversity is our strength, and it mustn't become a weakness!\n\nEthnic and Nationalist Tensions are currently §GLOW§!. Such radical movements are disorganised and broadly unpopular, but they still have influence over our citizens."

DNF_figl_plan_1: "The Figl Plan"
DNF_figl_plan_1_desc: "The "Mitteleuropäisches Wiederaufbauprogramm", or Figl Plan for short, will take advantage of the infrastructure of Mitteleuropa to allow Danubian investment to reach the most devastated areas of Europe, allowing us to do our part in rebuilding the bloodied continent and bring stability back to our neighbours.

DNF_foreign_policy_divided: "Divided Foreign Policy"
DNF_foreign_policy_divided_desc: "The Danubian Federation's entrance to the Second Weltkrieg is generally seen as a blinding success, which debatably turned the tide of the war against the Syndicalists and saved the German Empire from collapse. However, with the increasingly polarised post-war world, the Federal Government is finding itself questioning their allegiances.\n\nDanubia's initial entrance into the Reichspakt, along with the Italian Republic, was a pragmatic move by Kaiser Karl I to improve the effectiveness of the Danubian army, however, the increasingly autocratic, belligerent shift of the German Sphere has left many in the Federation concerned. Voices on all sides of the government call for different actions to be taken, from fully aligning with Germany to splitting completely with Danubia's 'Brother in Arms'. We will need to pick a side at some point, but we mustn't be too hasty as the global situation develops further."
DNF_foreign_policy_europeanist: "Europeanist Foreign Policy"
DNF_foreign_policy_europeanist_desc: "The time has come and the choice has been made. It is felt that it would be more logical, for the time being to pursue a European foreign policy that remained alongside the Germans. Their overseas empire will allow us to focus on the nearby threats of Russia and the Balkan States while continuing to build a stronger, democratic Europe.\n\nTo affect change, it is sometimes better to be inside the room."
DNF_foreign_policy_non_aligned: "Non-Aligned Foreign Policy"
DNF_foreign_policy_non_aligned_desc: "The time has come and the choice has been made. The threat of the Kalterkrieg is one that will destroy the world if it is left to go out of control. By standing aside from that as a matter of principle, we are able to act as mediators and peacemakers.\n\nSometimes it's best to stand apart in order to lead by example."
DNF_The_Personal_Prinzip: "Das Personalprinzip"
DNF_The_Personal_Prinzip_desc: "The Austromarxist ideal resolution to the nationalities question faced by the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later by the Danubian Federation, the hypothesis was created in the late 1890's and subsequently became the life's work of Karl Renner and many of his disciples within the SDAPD. Having finally achieved it, the nation looks to a relaxation in ethnic tensions as the previous federal-national structure is dissolved in favour of a more representative central-federal one as a supra-national state.\n\nBy defining the modern nation as an association of like-minded and equivalently speaking people, a cultural community of modern people who are no longer bound by the soil, Renner sought to open up a way of organizing territory and nationality within the multinational state in such a way that autonomy no longer had to mean state secession for the minority nations.\n\nOf course, this drawing together could ultimately be an unravelling..."
DNF_nations_within_a_state: "Nationen innerhalb eines Staates"
DNF_nations_within_a_state_desc: "As outlined by the Balaton Congress of 1937-1938, the Danubian Federation is built upon the \"Nationen innerhalb eines Staates\" (Nations within a State) principle, where 'Staatsrecht' and national autonomy are enshrined in the Federal Constitution of 1938.\n\nUnder the Federal Constitution, the constituent nations of the Federation have heavy autonomy, with their own elected legislature and reservist \"Landsturm\" armies, ensuring their national rights are protected. Combined with a fairly weak Federal government, this means the various Nations of Danubia can be wildly different in terms of ideology, outlook and ethnicity, but are still united as one Federation.\n\nOf course, not all are happy with the current state of affairs. The SDAPD wish to reform the Constitution around the Austromarxist 'Personal Principle', which they claim will help alleviate ethnic tensions further. On the flip side, some members of the 'Balaton Bloc' believe that Federal power needs to be increased, lest the whole Federation could naturally drift apart under divergent ideologies. In addition, though the rights of the various ethnic minorities of Danubia are protected, many are not universally represented within National and Federal Politics."
DNF_nations_within_a_state_2: "Nationen innerhalb eines Staates"
DNF_nations_within_a_state_desc_2: "As outlined by the Balaton Congress of 1937-1938, the Danubian Federation is built upon the \"Nationen innerhalb eines Staates\" (Nations within a State) principle, where 'Staatsrecht' and national autonomy are enshrined in the Federal Constitution of 1938.\n\nUnder the Federal Constitution, the constituent nations of the Federation have heavy autonomy, with their own elected legislature and reservist \"Landsturm\" armies, ensuring their national rights are protected. The Federal government somewhat stronger in some aspects after the last few years, however the various Nations of Danubia can be wildly different in terms of ideology, outlook and ethnicity, but are still united as one Federation.\n\nOf course, not all are happy with the current state of affairs. The SDAPD still wish to reform the Constitution around the Austromarxist 'Personal Principle', which they claim will help alleviate ethnic tensions further. On the flip side, a few voices in the 'Balaton Bloc' still believe that Federal power needs to be increased, lest the whole Federation drift apart. The cantonisation of the Crownlands has led to increased calm, with the remaining voices among the Balaton Bloc somewhat muted by this change."
DNF_unfettered_economy: "Unfettered Economy"
DNF_unfettered_economy_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg brutalised nations across the world, killing countless and obliterating countless more economies. We therefore find ourselves as an exception. Aside from sporadic and failed Syndicalist raids on the Adriatic Coast, and Russian bombers being shot down at the borders of Galicia, our nation was basically unharmed by the horrors of war.\n\nInstead, our factories are booming from wartime production measures while Danubian businesses are beginning to dominate in neighbouring regions. Every major industry we have only got stronger thanks to the war effort, helping our transformation from a once great power into one of the world's greatest.\n"
DNF_Self_Management_2: "Industrial Self Management Paradigm"
DNF_Self_Management_2_desc: "The self management paradigm as proposed and implemented by the Danubian government is the means by which workers' councils and unions in the workplace are extended, providing support and resources for employees as well as working to align the interests of managers and workers towards more productive outcomes."

DNF_Danubian_Identity_idea: "The Danubian Identity"
DNF_Danubian_Identity_idea_desc: "State sponsorship of an official model of Danubian Identity has provided some measure of calm due to clarification on the matter of what exactly being Danubian means, at least in legal and official circles."
DNF_Dollfuss_government: "The Dollfuß Government"
DNF_Dollfuss_government_desc: "The Grand Coalition is no more, now the CSP-OKgFP and Minister-President Dollfuß rule alone. The seats for a majority are not quite there, so federal politics will be a bit more tumultuous than people are used to, but it is not the end of the world... despite what some say."
DNF_SocDem_Coalition: "The SocDem Coalition"
DNF_SocDem_Coalition_desc: "The CSP-OKgFP proved themselves susceptible to factionalism and infighting. It is time to take in some of the parties that have so loyally served in opposition, and have the SDAPD lead Danubia with them for some time. The CSP-OKgFP might prove themselves worthy of government in the future, but right now the voices of Danubian opinion are heard from across many parties."

DNF_Civil_Alternative: "Civilian Service"
DNF_Civil_Alternative_desc: "Some individuals, for whatever reason, have no specific desire or ability to serve in the armed forces. However the state still wishes them to have some involvement in contributing towards the benefit of the nation. Thus, the Civilian Service was born."

DNF_Federal_Election_1951: "The Danubian Federal Election of '51 Tree"
DNF_Federal_Election_1955: "The Danubian Federal Election of '55 Tree"

### Starting Tree ###

DNF_conservative_budget: "Keep A Conservative Budget"
DNF_conservative_budget_desc: "While we are in a good position, we should sure we do not over extend our financial means. The upcoming 'Peace Budget' will therefore be rather conservative in scope, allowing us to build up a considerable reserve that can be utilised down the line when, not if, the going gets tough."
DNF_proposal: "The Hayek Proposal"
DNF_proposal_desc: "Economist Friedrich Hayek proposes that we should reap the boon of our fortunate position, leveraging it to guarantee future dividends. This idea could be risky long-term, theres no telling how long our economic boom will last, but it could yield impressive improvements to the average Danubian's way of life."
DNF_economic_council: "Maintain The Federal Economic Council"
DNF_economic_council_desc: "Danubia is currently the largest free-trade area in Europe and part of that is the standardisation rolled out by the Federal Economic Council in the wake of Black Monday. It has proven its worth, we should keep it to continue co-ordinating economic affairs."
DNF_staatsrecht: "Strengthen The 'Staatsrecht' Principle"
DNF_staatsrecht_desc: "What is our Federation if it's not many Nations within one State? Economic affairs should be conducted on the National Level, not by some remote bureaucrat in an office in Wien. We will devolve further economic powers to the National Assemblies. Hopefully, this will not be a mistake..."
DNF_peacetime: "Spending For Peacetime"
DNF_peacetime_desc: "The war is over, and we cannot justify the military expenses we've been making now that we're on a peace footing. The budget should be realigned to reflect that, with deep cuts to military spending across the board."
DNF_enshrine_military_provisions: "Enshrine Federal Military Provisions"
DNF_enshrine_military_provisions_desc: "The Federal Army has done much for us, and is one of our truly unifying institutions. We should maintain its strength in the form of a strong budgetary backing, though this will annoy the more doveish Socialists in the coalition."
DNF_peace_budget: "Pass The 'Peace Budget'"
DNF_peace_budget_desc: "After much discussion and a fair bit of wrangling, Minister-President Wilhelm Miklas has drawn up the wide-reaching Peace Budget. Now, all we need is for the Grand Coalition to pass it through the Federal Parliament."
DNF_arms_commission: "Organize The Arms Commission"
DNF_arms_commission_desc: "The arsenals of our Federation are full of a great deal of materiel that has limited use in the present day. It would be logical to organise that materiel, plan for future acquisitions in a more unified fashion and dispose of obsolete weaponry."
DNF_figl_plan: "Commence The Figl Plan"
DNF_figl_plan_desc: "The time has come for Foreign Minister Figl's grand plan to be put into action. The "Mitteleuropäisches Wiederaufbauprogramm", or "Figl Plan" for short, will take advantage of the infrastructure of Mitteleuropa to allow Danubian investment to reach the most devestated areas of Europe, allowing us to do our part in rebuilding the bloodied continent and bringing stability back to our neighbours. Let us share our wealth in the spirit of Christian generosity to our allies."
DNF_new_world: "The New World"
DNF_new_world_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg has reshaped the international situation. Today, a battle for global dominance appears to be shaping up between Germany and the Entente. We need to tread very carefully in this new world, and decide where our loyalties truly lie..."
DNF_berlin: "Working with Berlin"
DNF_berlin_desc: "We have done well out of our collaboration with Berlin. We should continue it for our mutual benefit."
DNF_diplomatic_autonomy: "Pursue Diplomatic Autonomy"
DNF_diplomatic_autonomy_desc: "The Danubian Federation has so much more potential than being the junior partner to Berlin's ambitions will ever allow."
DNF_milan: "Improve Relations With Rome"
DNF_milan_desc: "With the reunification of Italy under the compromise candidate from the Savoy-Aosta family, Umberto II, there are still several matters that are barricades toward a peaceful border in our West. We should seek to improve relations via bilateral channels and investments into our neighbour."
DNF_italian_relations: "Improve Relations With Rome"
DNF_italian_relations_desc: "With the reunification of Italy under the compromise candidate from the Savoy-Aosta family, Umberto II, there are still several matters that are barricades toward a peaceful border in our West. We should seek to improve relations via bilateral channels and investments into our neighbour."
DNF_anti_russia: "Keeping Savinkov Down"
DNF_anti_russia_desc: "We have the opportunity to continue to destabilise the threat to our eastern flank by funding Ukrainian partisans in the occupied territories. The Savinkovist regime has overplayed it's hand and there is absolutely no reason that we do not proceed to draw further blood from their wounds."
# DNF_stay_out: "Stay Out Of The Risorgimento"
# DNF_stay_out_desc: "We don't want to be drawn into the affairs of our neighbours in this case. A Risorgimento is not in our interests and we should let the Italians spend as much blood and treasure on it as possible, so the resulting state will be weak and manipulable."
DNF_pick_a_side: "A Dynastic Alliance"
DNF_pick_a_side_desc: "It is in all the papers already, that Archduke Robert of Austria-d'Este and Princess Margherita of Aosta-Savoy are in love with one another. It would also be in our interests to make sure the Straits of Otranto are held by an ally.\n\nThus, Kaiser Otto plans to propose acceptable terms to Rome on a dynastic arrangement for the two young lovers, with an additional diplomatic approach which will provide opportunities for our governments to further collaborate and step over the thorny issue of naval rights."
DNF_italy_bases: "Ensuring Mutual Security"
DNF_italy_bases_desc: "Our withdrawal from Italy was forced by the economic turmoil induced by Black Monday, and with the reunification of the country, we had to insist on a demilitarized zone along our border. However the current state of affairs in the world indicates a more note-worthy agreement may be in order.\n\nAdditionally, we could perhaps allow the Italians freedom in their own lands, a gesture that should go down well."
DNF_italian_relations2: "Ensuring Mutual Security"
DNF_italian_relations2_desc: "Our withdrawal from Italy was forced by the economic turmoil induced by Black Monday, and with the reunification of the country, we had to insist on a demilitarized zone along our border. However the current state of affairs in the world indicates a more note-worthy agreement may be in order.\n\nAdditionally, we could perhaps allow the Italians freedom in their own lands, a gesture that should go down well."
DNF_minister_president: "The Next Minister-President"
DNF_minister_president_desc: "Minister-President Miklas has led our federation through the storm of the Second Weltkrieg. Such a thing has not left him with much strength remaining for the daily trials, tribulations and trivium of politics. He feels that his time is done and so he will retire to spend some time with his family, handing the reins over to a fresh set of hands in order to win the peace."
DNF_remember_the_bear: "Remember The Bear"
DNF_remember_the_bear_desc: "As the hardliner faction of the CSP-OKgFP are eager to remind us, the Russian state is still revanchist, led by the unstable Savinkov and on our eastern border after three days of an armoured spearhead through the rump of Ukraine. There is a logic to the fact that we should maintain our current force distribution and stance."
DNF_conscription: "Retain Limited Conscription"
DNF_conscription_desc: "A conscript is a citizen of the federation first and foremost. Therefore all should serve where possible. We will need every citizen who can to do their duty to defend this fragily balanced, wonderful democratic state that is the heart of Europe."
DNF_swords: "Swords Into Plowshares"
DNF_swords_desc: "Our weapons have served us well, but the world is changing. It would be better for us to divert our energies to other pursuits, rather than hanging our industrial might on a cross of iron that will bleed us dry. Danubia will provide an example of a more peaceful, prosperous world."
DNF_best: "Only The Best"
DNF_best_desc: "The armed forces should be those who hear the call to serve. We'll take those and then remove the ones who don't have the stamina or disposition to succeed. The remainder will prove to be a fearsome opposition to any who might think of interfering with Danubian interests."
DNF_hybrid_proposal: "Allow Civilian Alternatives"
DNF_hybrid_proposal_desc: "While war should be left to the professionals, if the scale of the next war to come is anything like the Second Weltkrieg then they will require the assistance of many amateurs. The nation will need a pool of reservists and militia to draw on, should the worst happen. A shorter term of conscription, with an alternative in civil national service is the order of the day for the time being."
DNF_institute_commission: "Institute The von Mises Commission"
DNF_institute_commission_desc: "Ludwig von Mises, famed economist and son of the city of Lemburg in Galicia has proposed a commission to investigate opportunities to develop the lands near the borders of the federation that were previously treated as marches. Whilst there has been some minor successes in economic development, von Mises and his commission plan to seek specific opportunities that an injection of federal funding would help."
DNF_university_act: "The Federal University Act"
DNF_university_act_desc: "The renowned and combined intellect of Danubia is immense, but it is a fraction of what it could be. Providing assurances that anyone who makes the passing grade at the gymnasium will be supported by the Federal government while getting their bachelor's degree will allow for an explosion in graduates. An educated work force is a more productive work force!"
DNF_revive_ideas: "Revive Zipernowsky's Ideas"
DNF_revive_ideas_desc: "Karoly Zipernowsky, the apostle of alternating current, and one of the great minds of our time proposed the creation of high-voltage lines as a means to power railways. His designs have been studied and his ideas were always of interest, the electrification of the railways along with high-speed transportation would reduce time wasted in transit and allow for rapid movement of goods, troops and materials. Now we have an economy strong enough to make it a reality, and by improving our infrastructure, we will reforge that strength over again."
DNF_galician_development_project: "Galician Development Project"
DNF_galician_development_project_desc: "The Galizisch-Karpathische Petroleum Aktien-Gesellschaft has one of the largest refineries in Europe at Drohobycz south of Lemburg. While they employ thousands already, the oil fields at Boryslaw, Jasło, and Drohobycz could become the centre of the Danubian venture into the lucrative and interesting world of plastics, with an injection of cash as well as some technical and managerial experience from the finest minds in Wien. It would also raise the prestige of the crownland and reduce some nationalist sentiment."
DNF_transylvanian_infrastructure: "Overhaul Transylvanian Infrastructure"
DNF_transylvanian_infrastructure_desc: "The meat of the complaints of the PNR in Transylvania is actually something that we can do something about. They feel as though they are in a backward land, isolated from the heart of affairs by the woods and mountains. With modern construction techniques and Federal funding, we would be able to improve the infrastructure of Transylvania, and perhaps add some high speed rail lines between Cluj, Brasov and Budapest. The federal attention would raise the prestige of the crownland and reduce some nationalist sentiment."
DNF_modernize_illyria: "Modernizing Illyria's Periphery"
DNF_modernize_illyria_desc: "The scenic coast between Rijeka and Dubrovnik, the rugged hills of the interior toward Sarejevo and then on to Vukovar, the periphery of Illyria is a place of stunning natural beauty. However these hills have still had bandits within living memory, and the crownland needs some financial and managerial assistance to be brought into the atomic era."
DNF_president_dolfuss: "Minister-President Dollfuß"
DNF_president_dolfuss_desc: "Engelbert Dollfuß, from humble origins in Hollabrunn, has ascended to the highest governmental office in the Danubian Federation. He is considered somewhat authoritarian in his techniques and tactics. However he's made his way to the top. The question is now, what will he do with it?"
DNF_agricultural_renaissance: "The Grand Agricultural Renaissance"
DNF_agricultural_renaissance_desc: "A renaissance of agriculture can happen, given the right conditions. It is said that if properly managed, the Carpathian Basin and its rich loamy loess soil could feed all of Europe. The proper management is now in place. It is time for Danubia to feed the hungry, time to let a thousand (paprika) flowers bloom."
DNF_mobilize_the_landbund: "Mobilize The Landbund"
DNF_mobilize_the_landbund_desc: "The Landbund represents the interests of both agriculture and heimat. The Danubian identity is one that is essentially agrarian, no matter what those pie in the sky socialists will sell you. By mobilizing these organisations, we can cement support in rural areas, increase productivity and enjoy the natural bounties that Danubia deserves."
DNF_scale_figl_plan: "Scale Up The Figl Plan"
DNF_scale_figl_plan_desc: "The Figl Plan as it stands is... good. But it was constrained by Minister-President Miklas's vision. He could only see from the boundaries of the war. The Figl Plan can stand to be scaled up, and other countries outside of the Reichspakt can be invited. It will show Danubia's strength and ability on the world stage, which is what we want to do."
DNF_undermine_grand_coalition: "Undermine The Grand Coalition"
DNF_undermine_grand_coalition_desc: "The Socialists constantly nay-say, obstruct or compromise our motions down to insubstantial whimperings from their original meanings. We cannot achieve the vision that Minister-President Dollfuß has for Danubia with them in government. So little birds must fly, and spiders must whisper in their webs. The days of the Grand Coalition are numbered. The CSP-OKgFP can do it alone."
DNF_assess_balaton_principles: "Assess The Balaton Principles"
DNF_assess_balaton_principles_desc: "The lofty founding principles of our nation written over the course of the Balaton conference were well meant. However they miss some key points, and several of them could be reconsidered either entirely or in part. This will be controversial, but it is better to be honest and truthful. The founding documents of our nation are flawed and need reworking, lest they destroy Danubia through our inaction."
DNF_push_out_socialists: "Push Out The Socialists"
DNF_push_out_socialists_desc: "All the pieces are in place, the Socialists have proven their inability to govern or to co-operate with effective governance. It is time to break the coalition deal and move Danubia forward into a future where the country can be managed by a competent manager, instead of a committee half comprised of buffoons who think they can conjure money out of thin air."
DNF_president_tildy: "Minister-President Tildy"
DNF_president_tildy_desc: "Tildy Zoltán, a Hungarian from Losonc in the Slovakian Crownland, has ascended to the highest governmental office in the Danubian Federation. He is a well respected and pious man. Now he's the first Hungarian Minister-President to a Habsburg Emperor and truly an example of how far Danubia has progressed. The question is now, how much further will it go with him in charge?"
DNF_reaching_across_the_aisle: "Reaching Across The Aisle"
DNF_reaching_across_the_aisle_desc: "True government does not rely simply on the formation of a coalition. Rather it works when all parties and therefore all voters have some say in the process. Perhaps by speaking to other parties outside of government, then we can both ensure the needs of our federation and it's citizens are being met, and defang our opponents best policies in the process."
DNF_examine_national_obligations: "Examine National Obligations"
DNF_examine_national_obligations_desc: "There are many economic differences between the nations of our federation. Perhaps therefore we should consider re-evaluating whether or not they should just pay their own way, or perhaps the more developed crownlands can contribute to the benefit of those which are not."
DNF_equalize_federal_ministries: "Equalize The Federal Ministries"
DNF_equalize_federal_ministries_desc: "Minister-President Tildy is the first Hungarian in the role, perhaps there are others who have been previously overlooked by their talents because of their origins. Let's appoint a few more diverse faces in order to underline the new way of working in Danubia."
DNF_agrobusiness_tax_breaks: "Tax-Breaks For Agrobusiness"
DNF_agrobusiness_tax_breaks_desc: "Danubia is an agrarian country, ultimately. It is said that if properly managed, the Carpathian Basin and its rich loamy loess soil could feed all of Europe. However the agricultural combines are limited by their means. Lets not have the federal government adding any additional burdens by an unfriendly tax regime."
DNF_courting_the_fblp: "Courting the FBLP"
DNF_courting_the_fblp_desc: "The Föderation der Bürgerlichen und Liberalen Parteien (Federation of Civic and Liberal Parties) sometimes have more in common with us than the CSP-OKgFP Falken hardliners. It might not be a bad idea to introduce them into the government, and split with the hardliners so that we don't have to compromise on policy in internal party disputes so frequently."
DNF_keep_diplomatic_channels_open: "Keep Diplomatic Channels Open"
DNF_keep_diplomatic_channels_open_desc: "Danubian politics recently has shown that perhaps being in the Reichspakt is not the best fit for our national direction or identity. We should make efforts to keep diplomatic channels open with the Accord countries, so that we might be considered a more neutral party, above the frey, than a member of the opposition."
DNF_president_de_gasperi: "Minister-President De Gasperi"
DNF_president_de_gasperi_desc: "Alcide De Gasperi was born in Pieve Tesino, the son of a policeman of modest means. His career to the upper echelons of politics has been a path of balance between advocating for his national minority and his passionate defence of Christian Democratic principles. His good relations with the Vatican and his passion for his Danubian motherland will provide plenty of opportunities in the Italian arena."
DNF_president_raab: "Minister-President Raab"
DNF_president_raab_desc: "The offspring of a middle-class family from Sankt-Polten, Julius Raab has ascended to one of the highest peaks of power in Danubia. His career thus far has been first fighting on the Italian and Russian front in the First Weltkrieg, then a brief stint of University, and a rise through the political layers of the CSP-OKgFP. He is a steady hand on the tiller, that represents a continuation of Miklas's politics."
DNF_unite_the_right: "Unite The Right"
DNF_unite_the_right_desc: "The principles of Christian Democracy are a strong lodestone by which the nations of Danubia can form a unified state. Let us unify the parties within that nation, so we can lead them all the better. Together we are strong, alone we are weakened."
DNF_working_with_nations: "Working With The Nations"
DNF_working_with_nations_desc: "Co-ordinating between nations, languages and cultures can be hard work. However we must work to overcome these divisions in order for Danubia to form a more representative, democratic state. Some things must therefore be taken for granted, from Krk to Krakow, Feldkirch to Floresti. We must work with the nations to ensure this is the case."
DNF_question_of_further_devolution: "A Question Of Further Devolution"
DNF_question_of_further_devolution_desc: "It needs to be considered of the nations within the state, if there are more responsibilities that they can take on. The federal government must be seen only as the solution in the final moment of need, rather than an endless supply of funds and manpower for pet projects."
DNF_organize_the_kindi_commission: "Organize The Kindl Commission"
DNF_organize_the_kindi_commission_desc: "Karel Kindl, notable Bohemian Social Democrat has proposed that we explore possibilities relating to the improved representation of minority nations within Danubia. At present while the various crownlands represent the largest segments of the population, the nationalities question remains one that is diverse in terms of its problems and potential solutions. The needs of the Rusyns, Italians, Szekely, Sachsens and many smaller groups are still not fulfilled. This commission will investigate what can be done to ameliorate their problems."
DNF_revise_the_nationalities_act: "Revise The Nationalities Act"
DNF_revise_the_nationalities_act_desc: "The results of the Kindl Commission have been formulated, the conclusions have been written into a report handed to the government. The need is clear. There must be a revision of the Nationalities Act in order to better represent the individual needs of the various minority groupings in order to counteract the ever present lure and poison of nationalism within Danubia."
DNF_strengthen_the_coalition: "Strengthen The Coalition"
DNF_strengthen_the_coalition_desc: "Whilst we do not always see eye to eye on all things and all projects, the Grand Coalition and our arrangement with the SDAPD allows us to make a true difference in the way we govern the many states of the nation. It makes sense to work more closely with them, to learn from their own hardships in forming a federal party."
DNF_federalize_the_christian_bloc: "Federalize The Balaton Bloc"
DNF_federalize_the_christian_bloc_desc: "Bloc politics is all well and good but targeted projects, political tricks and schemes can allow our opponents to peel away our support and compromise our base at vital moments. The time has come for the states within a nation to have a unified conservative party that is truly federal rather than regional."
DNF_expand_the_welfare_state: "Expand The Welfare State"
DNF_expand_the_welfare_state_desc: "Danubia is a modern, progressive and prosperous nation. It is in the nature of Christian charity to give to those who are in need. There are five giant evils in Danubian society, squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease. Expanding the welfare state will destroy those things. Conditional upon the applicant seeking gainful employment, a state insurance scheme paid during prior employment will resolve many problems related to those five giants. By attacking them at the root, Danubia cements the foundation of its successes, and attacks its failures."
DNF_president_renner: "Minister-President Renner"
DNF_president_renner_desc: "The 'Father of the Grand Coalition' and chairman of the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Donausfoederation, Karl Renner has come far from his humble origins as one of eighteen children, a son of poor wine-growers.\n\nThe Austro-Marxist ideals that formed the basis of the 'Personal Prinzip' of national personal autonomy were formulated in part by Renner, and were pushed by the 'Rotes-Österreich' government that he led in the 1930's to Balaton.\nThe Balaton Principles ultimately did not align with that idea and the Danubian Federation took on a different character.\n\nForced by electoral mathematics to be the junior partner in the political equation, the short-lived Dollfuß government has given him one more chance to try and make the change he believes is needed for Danubia, if he can get the votes for it."
DNF_repairing_the_grand_coalition: "Repairing The Grand Coalition"
DNF_repairing_the_grand_coalition_desc: "The brief period of the Dollfuß government spawned many iniquities that must be overcome by the Grand Coalition before we can move forward with our political agenda. Whilst Dollfuß has lost his job and brought shame to his party, he has not formally resigned. If there is to be any peace within the Coalition we must pressure him and his confederates to hand in their notices, at the very least."
DNF_soothing_tensions: "Soothing National Tensions"
DNF_soothing_tensions_desc: "Minority groups are up in arms over the perceived injustices of the Dollfuß government's plans for continuing radical change in the fabric of Danubian society. Documents of dubious origins have been produced that paint an alarming picture. It has become quite clear, if one believes these files, that the old pattern of 'Germanisation and Magyarisation' was to be resumed, and that the central authority in Wien was to become an overreaching force for tyranny once again. We have to destroy this perception and stamp out conspiracies where they may arise."
DNF_rally_around_the_flag: "Rally Around the Flag"
DNF_rally_around_the_flag_desc: "Things have not been particularly good in Danubia lately. We should remind people of why they should be proud to be Danubian. Let them know that this was a blip and an error in our countries course, caused by shady back-room politicking and foreign interference as opposed to the free and democratic will of the Danubian peoples. People must know that Danubia is still a good place to live, and a place where people do not need to be afraid of the state."
DNF_SDAPD_Agenda: "Implementing Our Agenda"
DNF_SDAPD_Agenda_desc: "Much precious time has been wasted dealing with the mess left by Dollfuß and his cronies. With his resignation secured and the ship of state righted once more, we can now actually look forward to enacting our own agenda. It has been far too long that the Christian bloc has called the shots and we have had to force them to compromise. Now we will write policy and they will come to us with changes that we will then discuss with them."
DNF_Convincing_The_Junior_Partner: "Convincing the 'Junior' Partner"
DNF_Convincing_The_Junior_Partner_desc: "Despite the SDAPD leading the country, we are in hock to the Christian bloc. Calling an early election without moving our agenda forward is out of the question, but at the same time without the support of the CSP we cannot reliably pass measures in the Federal diet. Thus we need to convince them. Fortunately there are a decent number of pragmatists who are looking to continue repairing the damage of the Dollfuß government, and if we sway them, we might be capable of continuing our plans."
DNF_Expanding_State_Institutions: "Expanding State Institutions"
DNF_Expanding_State_Institutions_desc: "The error of the Dollfuß government was that the state's own institutions were weak enough to be captured by an unholy alliance of outside forces and hardline right wing elements. Even if it was only temporary, there were plenty of people who went along with the new programme without much concern as to the fact it might ultimately destroy the fabric of Danubian society. By reinforcing the role of institutions and diminishing that of personalities, we can ensure this does not happen again."
DNF_Building_Regional_Support: "Building Regional Support"
DNF_Building_Regional_Support_desc: "While the Personal Principle has support at the Federal level throughout the SDAPD there are still many local particularisms that need to be dealt with, debates won and party districts brought into line at the regional level. If our voice is the same in each Diet in each country then the nations within a state will soon move toward our goal."
DNF_Moving_Past_Balaton: "Moving Past Balaton"
DNF_Moving_Past_Balaton_desc: "The Dollfuß government was right in the sense that they sought to override and discard the Balaton documents as being unfit for purpose. However they wanted to regress Danubia to a reactionary era by discarding them. Instead we need to have people understand that the Balaton document did not go far enough, and that it was originally meant to contain the groundwork for the Personal Prinzip. Unfortunately Otto Ender managed to sabotage that by insisting on the Staatsrecht principle as a competitor, even if it was a parting blow by the old fox before he was retired by the CSP-OKgFP.\nSo we instead must fix his last attack, more than a decade later."
DNF_State_Development_Loans: "State Development Loans"
DNF_State_Development_Loans_desc: "The Von Mises Commission has done some very good work, but we feel that their conditions are perhaps too stringent. The state can promote further development and take a longer view of things than some of the banks that the Von Mises Commission recommend to their candidates once their angel-investments are finished. By adding a second tier of State support we are able to ensure that enterprises who may not reach immediate profitability, but show promise, can continue so they reach their profit point, rather than wasting funds on ventures that fail."
DNF_Overcoming_Christian_Bloc_Reluctance: "Overcoming the Balaton Bloc's Reluctance"
DNF_Overcoming_Christian_Bloc_Reluctance_desc: "Even the pragmatists in the Balaton Bloc still view some of our plans, such as developing the Personal Principle with a great degree of suspicion. They are conservative by nature, and see the Staatsrecht system working as well as anything can work given the numerous competing ethnic, social, linguistic and of course, class divides. We acknowledge that the Personal Principle isn't a panacea to resolve all issues, but it would allow Danubia to become a truer federation and allow individuals to elect representatives who are truly capable of representing them and their interests.\n Many individuals would still need representatives with a viewpoint such as the Balaton Bloc provides."
DNF_Building_Popular_Support: "Building Popular Support"
DNF_Building_Popular_Support_desc: "The people must be led to understanding, that is the duty of the social democratic party. Something well understood by our Austro-Marxist contingent as well. It is not enough for us to simply convince their representatives, we must explain to them, in detail and yet simply enough that any can understand how we are going to open up their world. No longer will the vaguaries of the map wholly determine the opportunities one might face in life. This must be reiterated over and over, until it is understood by the simplest farmhand as well as the intellectual in their academic seat of learning."
DNF_president_scharf: "Minister-President Schärf"
DNF_president_scharf_desc: "Born into a poor working class family, Schärf moved to Vienna at age 9. A talented young man, he put himself through law-school while working part time and having won a scholarship. At the end of the First Weltkrieg he was discharged from the army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He worked as a secretary under the tutelage of fellow South Moravian, Karl Renner in the SDAPD. Now he's scrambling to get the party ready for election, and mourning his friend."
DNF_prepare_for_the_federal_elections: "Prepare for the Federal Elections"
DNF_prepare_for_the_federal_elections_desc: "As much as we may mourn our former leader, Karl Renner, we must keep party organisation up. We have a duty to our nation to give our best possible showing in this election, so that we might properly follow his plan."

## Military Tree ##

DNF_lessons_of_war: "The Lessons Of The War"
DNF_lessons_of_war_desc: "The Danubian Federation entered the Weltkrieg with an army only partially reformed from the fractured and misaligned forces of Austria-Hungary. Divisional languages (sometimes more than three in a single division), stratification of rank by ethnic and national origin and the reserving of certain ethnic groups for certain roles were all things that had to be reworked or put aside in order to operate as a modern military force at the Federal level. The task now is that we must update the operational manuals, and on the basis of those updates retrain the Armeeoberkommando, then the officer corps and then NCOs. This is just a beginning of a lengthy undertaking, but it is an important first step."
DNF_formalize_the_oberkommando: "Formalise The Armeeoberkommando"
DNF_formalize_the_oberkommando_desc: "An adhoc recreation of the staff first created in the original weltkrieg, the value of the Armeeoberkommando is undoubted. If Danubia is to have this as an ongoing co-ordinating body between the different military branches then the institution needs to be formalised, and the Armeeoberkommando will have a dedicated building in Wien - the formerly disused Schloss Neugebaude, rather than the Kaisershaus in Baden bei Wien. This will allow the formation of a proper ancillary support staff in order to ensure our armed forces can be managed effectively."
DNF_realities_of_demobilazation: "The Realities Of Demobilisation For The Gemeinsame Armee"
DNF_realities_of_demobilazation_desc: "No longer burdened with infinite conscripts to do scutwork, and a generous budget of endless kronen, the Gemeinsame Armee will have to prove its fitness to serve and cut out some dead wood. The material of war costs more than ever before, and at the same time the Gemeinsame Armee has to show it can fight not just as a modern army, but as an army that can win the next war too."
DNF_modernize_officer_corps: "Modernising The Officer Corps"
DNF_modernize_officer_corps_desc: "The Officer Corps has received the new operational manuals and are undergoing retraining. However some officers have proven reticient to learn. Indeed some of them still seem to labour under the assertion in their private conversation, that they still live in a country called 'Austria-Hungary'. We need to ask a few of our younger candidates to step into higher command roles, and a few of our more grizzled veterans to allow Danubia to move into the Atomic age."
DNF_modernize_command_and_control: "Modernise Our Command And Control"
DNF_modernize_command_and_control_desc: "Signal flags? Telegrams? AM Radio? We need to embrace modern low-band frequency modulated radios with accompanying paper cipher codes to provide our forces with the ability to communicate wherever they are, securely and swiftly. Wartime advances in plastics, battery packs and radio technology will allow for these to be rolled out on a federal level to every division in the Gemeinsame Armee. They will allow troops to call in airstrikes, spot artillery and co-ordinate advances between infantry, armour and mechanised elements or even naval elements. It is necessary, if the Gemeinsame Armee is to win the battles of tomorrow."
DNF_complete_force_reintegration: "Complete Force Reintegration"
DNF_complete_force_reintegration_desc: "With the Modernisation of Command and Control, the retirement of the dinosaurs and the new fit and lean mentality firmly embedded in the Gemeinsame Armee, the Armeeoberkommando believe it is time to initiate a federal army exercise on the Hungarian plain in order to demonstrate the completeness of the force reintegration. It would also serve as a good end-to-end practise, since thus far divisions, officers and army groups have all tested the implementation at what the AOK Revised Field Manual calls 'Unit Test' level. This would be a first full army 'Integration Test'. Anticipation of a successful exercise wargame with the opposition forces representing Russian State troops would be a great assurance to the AOK and Danubia as a whole."
DNF_lesson_of_odesa: "The Lesson Of Odesa"
DNF_lesson_of_odesa_desc: "Our greatest victory in the second Weltkrieg was the breaking of the Russian encirclement of Odesa. The swift and rapid deployment of modern mechanised forces in a spearhead proved the decisive factor. We have to build our forces around the ability to provide that same decisive action in future, so that we can turn the tide of any war we join."
DNF_shadow_of_rimini: "The Shadow Of Rimini"
DNF_shadow_of_rimini_desc: "'It was just before dawn, One miserable morning in black 'forty four, When the forward commander, Was told to sit tight, When he asked that his men be withdrawn. And the Generals gave thanks, As the other ranks held back, The enemy tanks for a while, And the Rimini beachhead, Was held for the price, Of a few hundred ordinary lives... There was frost in the ground, When the Tiger broke free, And no one survived, From the Donau Schärfschutze Kompanie Z... They were all left behind, Most of them dead, The rest of them dying, And that's how the Armeeoberkommando, Took my daddy from me.' \n\nWe must learn from this stain on our battle record. The mismanagement of the Rimini landing is the greatest shame of the Armeeoberkommando. Improper communication between the Danubian and Italian joint commands as well as poor co-ordination of naval and aerial assets as well as bad intelligence turned a simple landing into a bloodbath that set back the progress of the war by six months. We cannot let it happen again. We will not."
DNF_shock_and_awe: "Shock And Awe"
DNF_shock_and_awe_desc: "The union between air, land and sea in perfect combination allows us to overrun our opponent in one huge, shocking attack that will demoralise our enemies and send them running for their foxholes. Naval shelling, close airsupport from airstrikes before a combined armoured and infantry advance will scatter our enemies to the breeze."
DNF_might_is_a_mechanized_monolith: "Might Is A Mechanised Monolith"
DNF_might_is_a_mechanized_monolith_desc: "The armoured spearhead has proven it's worth before now. But an army that is fully mechanised, that can deploy armoured vehicles in such overwhelming numbers can react to and pierce through the Russian horde and reach Moscow before those yokels can put down their vodka bottles. Danubian steel will crush Eurasia under it's treads, if need be."
DNF_robust_response: "Rapid Reactive Robust Response"
DNF_robust_response_desc: "Armoured and mechanised spearheads, backed by elite parachutists, mountain troops and marine forces will allow our armies to punch through hard positions, appear behind enemy lines and destroy infrastructure and then vanish through terrain inhospitable to our foes. We will be formless, until the moment of our strike against our opponents."
DNF_expand_corps: "Expand The Fallschirmjagerkorps"
DNF_expand_corps_desc: "The doctrinal requirements of our military masterminds require more parachutists than we currently have.

DNF_siting_a_testing_ground_desc: "A vast undertaking is to excavate and then reinforce an underground weapons testing facility. The question is where? Carpathia? Transilvania? Eastern Slovakia? The Tatras and Carpathians both provide plenty of vast mountains underneath which we can hide a detonation testing facility that will set seismometers ticking across Europe, whilst we safely develop our thermonuclear device."

DNF_war_performance_commission_desc: "The performance of various aeroplane models, pilots and airwings through the war is being considered by the War Performance Commission in order to assess tactics, strategies and current and future materiel acquisitions. Their conclusions will determine if Danubia will continue with license production or jump start local jet fighter production, and if an air force is to be formed."
DNF_independent_air_force: "An Independent Air Force"
DNF_independent_air_force_desc: "The war performance commission have concluded that the usage of the aerial troops in the war would have been better managed if they had been conducted by their own independent command structure instead of as subordinates to the army and navy. Therefore the commission has given the mandate to Air Ace and Commander Alexander Löhr to form an independant air force."
DNF_service_air_wings: "Service Air Wings"
DNF_service_air_wings_desc: "The war performance commission have concluded that the usage of the aerial troops in the war were adequately managed by their army and navy commanders and as such does not see the need at this time for a merging of army and navy air wings into an independant command.

DNF_lohrs_institutional_buildup: "Löhr's Institutional Build-Up"
DNF_lohrs_institutional_buildup_desc: "The air services have been reformed into an independent institution.

We expect this will all happen shortly and in good order."
DNF_die_raketenkorps: "Die Raketenkorps"
DNF_die_raketenkorps_desc: "Rockets are the technology of the future. By using rockets we will be able to bombard our foes from afar, destroy their aircraft overhead, and destroy their cities from a distance with minimal disturbance of our own personnel. An individual is costly, and the safety of the ground crew and the fact that a rocket does not need our airmen to risk themselves over foreign airspace means any material expense is more than saved by the fact we can retain a smaller, dedicated corps of demolitionists."
DNF_das_bomberkorps: "Das Bomberkorps"
DNF_das_bomberkorps_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg showed that bombers (and any nuclear devices they carry) will be able to make decisive blows against our enemies, whether striking their armies in the field, or by flying over their defenses and levelling their cities through conventional weapons or even by atomic strikes. We should ensure that Danubia has the necessary means and support for a powerful bomber wing, and the men who will crew them. The bombers will be the extension of our aerial power, that we will send our enemies back to the stone age with."
DNF_missile_defense_in_depth: "Missile Defense In Depth"
DNF_missile_defense_in_depth_desc: "Our development of rockets will allow us to defend our territory as well as strike our opponents.

With the dawn of the jet age, we need appropriate defenses rather than antiquated flak cannons."
DNF_go_ballistic: "Go Ballistic!"
DNF_go_ballistic_desc: "We should prioritise having missiles that can launch upward through the atmosphere and reach distant targets anywhere, at anytime. By having an arsenal of ballistic missiles we can, at an order, snuff out our opponents.

DNF_focus_on_guided_missiles: "Focus On Guided Missiles"
DNF_focus_on_guided_missiles_desc: "Surface to Air missile systems are good, but if we can improve and miniaturise the guidance systems we will have not only better defensive capabilities but also better means for our fighter forces to engage with the enemy. Air to Air missiles that can lock onto and pursue an opponent's aircraft should be our priority, so that we can guarantee air superiority."

DNF_die_atomrakete_desc: "The intercontinental missiles provide the perfect platform for a nuclear warhead delivery system. Our scientists believe they've found a way to reliably deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere on the planet, without any risk or strategic bomber crews involved. If we build the relevant infrastructure, we can launch missiles from secret silos or mobile missile trains and ensure that nobody on earth will consider attacking Danubia directly, lest they start the apocalypse itself!"

DNF_danubian_on_the_moon_desc: "The intercontinental missiles we have could, with some development be used as platforms to launch humans into space, to the moon even given time. We could demonstrate the intellectual prowess of the 'Old World' once and for all, and show the Accord and the Germans that Danubia is a scientific and military superpower. The Kaiser is due to give a speech, declaring our intentions and perhaps starting a race to Space."

DNF_return_to_sender_desc: "Enhanced development of surface to air missiles allows us to produce them in greater volumes and to create a system by which intruding aircraft or enemy missiles will be detected and detonated by skilled ground operators as soon as they infringe on our airspace. Danubia will be protected from infringing objects, identified or otherwise."
DNF_raumverteidigung: "Raumverteidigung"
DNF_raumverteidigung_desc: "Area defense for the various crownlands has to be our priority. Danubian interests are not served by wars of conquest or aggressive attacks but rather designing a national defense in depth that obstructs primary wargoals of opponents and protects the integrity of our borders, while acknowledging the interest of Danubia is in deterrence and defense rather than war abroad."

DNF_expand_regional_landstrum_desc: "The nations within the state still maintain their own forces. These can be called upon in times of need, brought up to fight wars abroad, or act as staybehind troops in the event of invasion.

DNF_expand_border_fortifications: "Expand And Maintain Border Fortifications"
DNF_expand_border_fortifications_desc: "There are many natural borders to Danubia. The Carpathians, the Alps, the Tatras and so forth provide immense bulwarks for any foes to overcome. But it does not befit a fine nation such as Danubia to rely on mere mountains when it has the means to build it's own additional defenses. There are also regions that, while sadly deficient in giant natural barriers, we can improve with a bit of concrete and the application of a few thousand kilometers of razorwire. We must also not forget our existing defenses, and make sure they are up to date and hardened against the latest enemy weaponry to a sufficient degree."

DNF_air_wing_innovations_desc: "'Air power rests at the apex of the first triad of victory, for it combines Mobility, Flexibility, and Initiative.' The age of propeller driven fighter planes is coming to an end, and our air-wings are being forced to innovate in order to find tactics that are effective in the new jet planes. This is a long process that will require ongoing rigour and increased flight times for our pilots before they can be considered qualified. Pilot training manuals will need updating and combat maneouvres will need to be understood in the context of the strength and fragility of jet-engine mounted aircraft."
DNF_embrace_jet_age: "Fully Embrace the Jet Age"
DNF_embrace_jet_age_desc: "The Jet is the future of aircraft, and that means that we need to have an air force that flies fighter-jets. Propeller aircraft, despite the advances of the end of the war, just cannot keep up with the jet craft. We need to go through a full evaluation of our inventory and see what can be sold, as well as beginning development of a next generation jet fighter for the Danubian air force, with an internal development testing and development tender. But whatever result we choose, the jets are here to stay regardless."
DNF_dogfighting_future: "The Future Of Dogfighting"
DNF_dogfighting_future_desc: "'1) The basics of Air Combat Manuevering have not changed since the early days of aviation, and 2) A fighter pilot must maintain constant aggressiveness for success. As the Red Baron would say, 'All else is rubbish.''\n\nHowever the weapons available to our pilots have changed. Rockets and missiles, once clunky attachments for bombing ground targets, can now pursue opponents unwise enough to get to close. The cannons mounted in our planes can now shred through the airframes of the opponent with ever more devastating ease. And the cost of a plane is higher than ever.\n\nOur pilots must learn to maintain their aggression, and make the enemy pay for any mistake he makes immediately."
DNF_blitz: "Der Blitz Des Kampfflugzeugs"
DNF_blitz_desc: "The lightning fast fighter planes!\n\nThe development of a next generation fighter jet to ensure Danubian air superiority in the future must begin sooner rather than later. The development of designs and testing them can take years before the project stops being a prototype and starts being a warplane. Therefore a committee must be set up to open a tender for designs, acquire a budget for acquisitions from the relevant organs and then explore and test the resultant choices to their full extent before authorising fullscale production."
DNF_close_air_support: "Close Air Support Primacy"
DNF_close_air_support_desc: "We must make sure it is understood by our air force that their role is not to go off on high-flying missions and taking aerial tours of the backwoods of our enemies country. They are to provide actionable intelligence and reconnaissance of enemy manouvres. They should be available to drop bombs and napalm on enemy strong-points from their jet-powered fighter-bombers when the corpsman on the ground calls on them from his radio. Close Air support has to be the primary role of the air wing."
DNF_strategic_bomber: "Strategic Bomber Deterrence"
DNF_strategic_bomber_desc: "Our strategic bomber wing will play the primary role in deterring attacks by our enemies. Their role is to go high over enemy defenses, flatten their cities and resource collecting infrastructure, and weaken the enemy behind the lines as while our armed forces take advantage of their weakened state and lack of supply by punching through and overwhelming them."
DNF_the_great_mothballing: "The Great Mothballing"
DNF_the_great_mothballing_desc: "The navy of the Danubian Federation is, in many respects, that of Austria Hungary. As such with the end of the war, the Kriegsmarine is being mothballed enmasse. Large battleships are going down to bare minimums of maintenance and smaller obsolete ships will be sold off for scrap or converted to fishing trawlers or convoys."
DNF_submersible_status_quo: "The Submersible Status Quo"
DNF_submersible_status_quo_desc: "Our submarines are some of the finest in the world and the advantages of silence and stealth cannot be understated. Submarine forces are also comparatively economical to the maintenance of carrier airgroups or battleships. Finally submarines will allow us to control the entirety of the Mediterranean and the sealanes beyond."
DNF_rising_air_sea_power: "Rising Air-Sea Power"
DNF_rising_air_sea_power_desc: "True overseas naval power is the combination of air and sea - modern weaponry from the Weltkrieg has showed that battleships are useful platforms for guns, but a plane can evade those guns and then destroy the battleships. Even if we lose a plane, the battleship will cost a hundred times more than the plane did."
DNF_plan_mh: "Plan MH"
DNF_plan_mh_desc: "K.u.K. Großadmiral Graf Miklos Horthy may have retired after the events of the Second Weltkrieg but he still has a degree of influence in military and policy circles throughout the Danubian governments. Given the mothballing of a major part of the fleet, his prestige and experience will provide a great deal of support for any future refurbishments to the navy. He also still has the vision to recognise the changes the navy must undertake to be a competitor in a modern world and can help guide decisions as to who his ultimate successor will be."
DNF_we_need_a_seawolf: "Get Kern, We Need A Seawolf!"
DNF_we_need_a_seawolf_desc: "Rear Admiral Ivan Kern has served with distinction in the battleship fleet, but he understands the vision of the submersible arm. He's a salty veteran who has served with distinction, and can lead our submarines into being the terrors of the Mediterranean and beyond."
DNF_vukovic_has_the_ambition: "Vukovic Has The Ambition"
DNF_vukovic_has_the_ambition_desc: "Janko Vukovic has served loyally alongside Miklos Horthy for years in the Admiralcy. It is now time for him to show his skills beyond the shadow of his ally and friend. He is a bold one, and believes that the continued combination of Air and Sea will provide Danubia with a strong weapon to press her enemies over the waters."
DNF_modern_carrier_task_force: "Establishing Modern Task Forces"
DNF_modern_carrier_task_force_desc: "Simply having a carrier is not enough, it must be supported with other ships that carry supplies, screen against submarines and torpedo boats and perform picket duties. It's therefore of crucial importance we develop the necessary infrastructure and ships to support these queens of the sea."
DNF_fast_and_numerous: "A Partisan Battlegroup"
DNF_fast_and_numerous_desc: "The design of our modern escorts work on the principle that as soon as our enemy is detected they are swarmed by a number of highly agile and decently armed ships that can deploy torpedos or fire deck guns before disengaging without the opponent being able to pursue."
DNF_speak_softly_and_carry_a_stick: "Speak Softly And Carry A Long Stick"
DNF_speak_softly_and_carry_a_stick_desc: "The design of our modern escorts is to work with our air, radar and sonar technicians to detect threats before they get too close to the Carrier task group, and react by the firing of long range guns or missiles before the enemy reaches engagement range."
DNF_die_froschmanner: "Die Froschmanner"
DNF_die_froschmanner_desc: "Teams of Navy Commando Frogmen provide additional support for operations, with each submersible having a squad of several specialists. These men also work aboard the surface fleet, providing any surface bombardment or landing with an infiltrator component that will create havoc behind enemy lines once the operation commences."
DNF_twenty_four_hour_awacs: "Twenty-Four Hour AEW"
DNF_twenty_four_hour_awacs_desc: "Aboard a carrier someone must always be awake. By scheduling and cycling aircrews we can use radar carrying aircraft to provide the carrier task force with constant updates as to the location of all aerial and naval vessels in it's area."
DNF_over_the_horizon_capability: "Over The Horizon Capability"
DNF_over_the_horizon_capability_desc: "The technical capacity of our radars and AEW contingents is such that we can launch strikes from our carrier task force group and it's screens at such ranges as to make our opponents not even know we were aware of them until we have already hit them."
DNF_kern_hears_it: "If A Crab Falls In The Water In Tunis, Kern Hears It"
DNF_kern_hears_it_desc: "By deploying many submarines and hydrophones throughout the mediterranean, as well as the feared Froschmanner, we have unrivalled intelligence on naval operations. Our ships can interdict our opponents, or strike without warning and there is nowhere for them to hide, short of hauling themselves into drydock and hoping we'll go away."
DNF_danubian_pond: "The Mediterranean Is A Danubian Pond"
DNF_danubian_pond_desc: "The conclusion of plan MH has seen the Mediterranean become a Danubian pond. The force we have built is modern, makes use of technology and innovation of individuals as well, and allows us to extend our power from Suez to Gibraltar and Gallipoli undisputed."
DNF_das_haifisch: "Der Haifisch Lebt Im Wasser"
DNF_das_haifisch_desc: "The Shark lives in water - with the completion of the Atomgerät there has been discussion as to two avenues of development. First submarine mounted missiles. These will have to wait for some time. The other project that is recommended to be started is the use of atomic elements in a reactor system to power the submarine, creating a vessel that will have to return to base to resupply only when its supplys of weapons or food start to run short. This is an achievable goal."
DNF_unternehmen: "SMS Unternehmen"
DNF_unternehmen_desc: "The Undertaking - a nuclear powered carrier. It would be bigger than anything built thus far by our navy and would take all the expertise of our dockyards and scientists but it would create an unrivalled base for our carrier task force and air wings. They would not have to return to base except for repairs, upgrades and decommissioning. Otherwise all transit aboard could be performed by tugs and supply ships could be sent to replenish it. Practically a portable island."
DNF_modern_escorts: "Modern Escorts"
DNF_modern_escorts_desc: "We must review and determine how we will use screening vessels with regards to the doctrinal changes we have began to implement, as well as update our existing vessels to use more modern apparatus where possible."
DNF_stealthy_domination: "Stealthy Domination"
DNF_stealthy_domination_desc: "Let enemy sailors shake in their bunks aboard their ships when they think of the Danubian submarines prowling the cool depths beneath them where the sun does not go. Let our foes mistake us for a land power uncomfortable on the seas. Let our domination be felt through the subtle application of pressure to our enemies on the nerves that hold their naval ventures together, rather than through some obvious show of force."

DNF_The_1951_Election_desc: "The Danubian Federal Election of 1951 will determine the look of the Federal Diet, and who will lead the government for the next four years. With the events of the last few years, there's no clear expectation as who will lead the nation. A strong campaign will lead any party to a victory."
DNF_The_SDAPD_51: "The SDAPD Campaign"
DNF_The_SDAPD_51_desc: "The Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Danubien is the only truly federal party, and has the organisational savvy and intelligent policy required to lead the nation to greatness over the next four years."
DNF_Government_Oversight_In_Industry: "Government Oversight In Industry"
DNF_Government_Oversight_In_Industry_desc: "Whilst our factories boom and the land gives up its resources, the side effects of industrialisation are unsightly pollution and dangerous chemical spills. Government is needed to regulate industry more strictly, and perhaps to oversee key sectors to ensure they are not poisoning our people, nor producing things which are dangerous to them."
DNF_The_Illyrian_Example: "The Illyrian Example"
DNF_The_Illyrian_Example_desc: "The Illyrian Crownland has prospered under a Social Democrat government that has started to turn around the fortunes of the region, reversing industrial stagnation, uplifting people from poverty and reducing the chronic unemployment that has strangled the region for decades. We can hold them up as a great example of what Social Democratic policies can do for the nation as a whole."
DNF_A_True_Federation: "A True Federation"
DNF_A_True_Federation_desc: "The Danubian Federation was not meant to be this way. The borders of the crownlands should not still be this sharp. The ending of the States within a Nation principle should be a key policy plank. The Federation should stand on its various merits as a whole, and have one consistent set of laws and regulations that are universal within its borders, which respect the rights of individuals and ethnicities to their language and customs, without the same individuals having different rights twenty kilometers due to an invisible border and a different legal regime."
DNF_A_Self_Managed_Society: "A Self-Managed Society"
DNF_A_Self_Managed_Society_desc: "The Illyrian economic principle and practise of Worker Self-Management has shown great gains, providing incentives to the workers to keep their firm competitive and showing how the involvement of people from all levels within an organisation can provide valuable insights, as opposed to the authoritarian and hierarchical top-down model pursued in most industrial sectors. Danubian society can benefit from this."
DNF_The_Personal_Prinzip_51: "The Personal Prinzip"
DNF_The_Personal_Prinzip_51_desc: "The concept of National Personal Autonomy (hereafter referred to as the Personal Prinzip) is the logical conclusion of the fact that Danubia is a consociational state - that is one that requires powersharing between the different disparent groups within it. Whilst we can hope for, and promote a Danubian identity, it must be one that contains multitudes. A plurinational state is the only cure for nationalism, and by definition it must therefore acknowledge and support the nationalities within its borders, whilst allowing individuals of those nationalities to navigate their lives without ever feeling that the state makes some unwarranted distinction based on physical location or national identity.\n\nThe Personal Prinzip was the idea that Karl Renner spent most of his life trying to bring to the public. If we win, we should honour his efforts and wisdom."
DNF_The_CSP_51: "The Balaton Bloc Campaign"
DNF_The_CSP_51_desc: "Danubia is a great nation. It is a great nation because of the stewardship of the Balaton Bloc, as leaders of the Grand Coalition. As partners of the Imperial Family. Danubia must stay the course, and continue to flourish. Why change what works? Why alter the winning formula?"
DNF_Point_To_Our_Successes: "Point To Our Successes"
DNF_Point_To_Our_Successes_desc: "Who led our nation to victory in the Second Weltkrieg? Was it Karl Renner? Was it Péter Veres? No. It was Wilhelm Miklas, of the CSP. But things have changed since 1948. Our current leader has proven his own credentials, he has made the nation stronger and developed the state so that the people of Danubia can flourish and prosper. We should make it evident, regardless of how obvious it is, that the country is in the state it is because of our policies."
DNF_A_Nation_Of_Innovation: "A Nation of Innovation"
DNF_A_Nation_Of_Innovation_desc: "Under the Balaton Bloc we have presided over a period of great development and flourishing that shows no sign of abatement. The people are free and able to create and design wonderous things that would have been regarded by our grandparents as miraculous. The nation is truly a place of excitement and interest for the first time in a long time. Thanks to our sage leadership."
DNF_Laud_The_Merits_Of_Staatsrecht: "Laud The Merits of Staatsrecht"
DNF_Laud_The_Merits_Of_Staatsrecht_desc: "The Staatsrecht has provided the limits of flexibility that have allowed our country to move past the initial hurdles of Austria-Hungary. The division into a true Federal-State model has created the right amount of change and opportunity without tipping the country into the arms of the nationalists, the radicals and the republicans. We should remind people that change has to be gradual, and carefully made, if at all. The Staatsrecht system proves that change can be good, but we should not go about tipping over the apple cart just because one or two might be a touch rotten."
DNF_Stewarding_Our_Economy: "Stewarding Our Economy"
DNF_Stewarding_Our_Economy_desc: "A careful touch here, a change to the interest rates there, an adjustment in the tax brackets on income over 100,000 kronen... We have finetuned the Danubian economy to be the ideal mix of innovation and governance. Our industries boom without overheating. The vast majority of people are wealthier than they were a decade ago. Children surpass their parents. The Federation should be reminded that our careful stewardship is what makes things this way."
DNF_A_Steady_Hand: "A Steady Hand At The Helm"
DNF_A_Steady_Hand_desc: "'Let's be frank - most of our people have never had it so good.' - We have survived a World War, and built a nation that any can be proud of no matter where he was born, or what his standing in our society is. Our steady hand, our policy has led Danubia this far. We should remain in power, and we will reach to the stars."
DNF_The_Agrarians_51: "The Agrarian-Liberal Campaign"
DNF_The_Agrarians_51_desc: "Politics makes for strange bedfellows, but the CPD/D Demokraten (Progressive Bloc) and the Föderation der Bürgerlichen und Liberalen Parteien (Federation of Civic and Liberal Parties) have reached breaking point. The Liberal Agenda has been unheard in Danubia for too long. The authoritarian excesses of both the Social Democrats and the Balaton Bloc have been unopposed due to their majority in the Federal Diet. It is time for the people of Danubia to remind who is in charge, and who is not."
DNF_Breaking_The_Grand_Coalition: "Breaking The Grand Coalition"
DNF_Breaking_The_Grand_Coalition_desc: "Any success we will have will involve at least one party in the Grand Coalition deciding that we are a more attractive partner than their current bedfellows. We must simultaneously attack one, and attract the other, so we might make our own Coalition."
DNF_Point_To_Their_Failures: "Point To Their Failures"
DNF_Point_To_Their_Failures_desc: "The Grand Coalition has led Danubia through uncertain times, but they have not done so perfectly. We should remind the people of the political meddling, the factionalism, the bold ideas that died under the endless compromises forced by their failed system of powersharing to keep us out, and then we should remind the people that it doesn't need to be this way."
DNF_A_Different_Foreign_Policy: "A Different Foreign Policy"
DNF_A_Different_Foreign_Policy_desc: "Danubian interests will be better served by a foreign policy that represents our values of Democracy and Liberty rather than the goals of German realpolitik!

DNF_Position_Ourselves_To_Lead: "Position Ourselves To Lead"
DNF_Position_Ourselves_To_Lead_desc: "For the longest time we have had to sit in opposition. We must make sure the electorate view us as more than a protest vote against business as usual.

DNF_A_New_Vision_For_Danubia: "A New Vision For Danubia"
DNF_A_New_Vision_For_Danubia_desc: "The leadership of the other two parties place themselves on long and esteemed traditions of social and national thought. But their vision is also one that hearkens back to making Austria-Hungary work, rather than reflecting on the current situation. We will show to the people that we are the party that will have Danubia grow strong and flourish under our care, as we look to the future of our nation and what we can do outside their hidebound patterns and partisan lines."

DNF_Developing_Illyria: "Illyrian Employment Support Program"
DNF_Developing_Illyria_desc: "\"Start by doing what's necessary, then what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.\" - St. Francis of Assisi.\n\nThe work done by the Sokol organisation in supporting the youth in Illyria is a good start but the creation and extension of employment programs will feed into the development of this region. In turn this will both tamp down any smouldering embers of resentment, and underline that the Habsburg presence in the region is a fact of life that will not change."
DNF_Developing_Transylvania: "Siebenbürgen Eisenhütte AG"
DNF_Developing_Transylvania_desc: "One of the largest employers in the Transylvanian region are the various mines which dot the landscape, each with a huddled village or town around it's entrance to provide the manpower to extract the lignite and iron from the ground. Now the Ganz-MAVÁG Werke combine have expressed an interest in constructing a iron and steelworks in the town of Brasov. However, they are requesting government aid for this venture. The prospects are good, and the influx of money in the region would spark further economic growth."
DNF_Developing_Slovakia: "Growing Slovak Heavy Industry"
DNF_Developing_Slovakia_desc: "Strategically speaking, we have a great deal of exposure on the German border. A significant portion of the industrial capacity of the entire Danubian Federation lies within striking range of Germany. Whilst relations between our two countries are not liable to sour to the point we should fear attack, it would still be prudent to take advantage of proximity to raw materials in Slovakia by building up the capability of the Crownland to support heavy industry."
DNF_Develop_The_Hungarian_Hinterlands: "Eastern Hungary Plan"
DNF_Develop_The_Hungarian_Hinterlands_desc: "The Tatras and Carpathians brood over the Eastern Hungarian Plain. Beneath them, and within their valleys, people toil in conditions that their grandparents would recognise. Expanding the mines, railways and roads of the region, clearing forests and developing the towns and villages will mean that their grandchildren will not."
DNF_Exploiting_Nagylengyel: "Exploiting Nagylengyel"
DNF_Exploiting_Nagylengyel_desc: "Recent prospecting in Zala county by gravity and seismic refraction has revealed something in the range of 45 million metric tonnes of oil. Developing this oil field is of strategic relevance to the whole country and it should not be left to the Hungarian national government to shoulder the burden in its entirety. Of course, that also means the federal budget will take a slice of the oil revenues as well."
DNF_Develop_Bukovina: "Rescuing Bukovina"
DNF_Develop_Bukovina_desc: "Bukovina is a shorthand in Danubia for grinding poverty. To do something 'the Bukovinan Way', is to do it by hand, without tools even. Developing the region by making funding available, building schools and sending equipment, will perhaps not shake this linguistic quirk. But the people of Bukovina will be grateful to see real improvements."
DNF_Develop_The_Austrian_Hinterlands: "Developing Vorarlberg and Postonjia"
DNF_Develop_The_Austrian_Hinterlands_desc: "Both Vorarlberg and Postonija are rural and mountainous, even by Austrian standards. Putting a little money aside from the Federal budget to bring them into the future will settle grousing that development funds only go to the poorer, ethnic crownlands, and it'll provide additional ease of transportation to Switzerland and Italy from Wien respectively."
DNF_Developing_The_Sudentenland: "Taming the Bohemian Massif"
DNF_Developing_The_Sudentenland_desc: "The Bohemian Forest, Sudetes and Ore Mountains make the borders of the Bohemian Massif. Each mountain range mostly consists of broad, sloping hills that make transportation into and out of Bohemia more difficult perhaps than it should be. By putting some funding into these regions we can improve the countryside there and create opportunities for economic development which will drive improved infrastructure."
DNF_Danubian_Highway_Network: "Danubian Federal Highways Project"
DNF_Danubian_Highway_Network_desc: "The Donaubundesautobahnen Projekt (Danubian Federal Highways Project) promises to both improve freedom of movement across the country and provide employment for unskilled labour, as well as providing a network of roads that will knit the disparate regions of the nation together more firmly."
DNF_Federal_Ministry_Of_Veterans_Affairs: "The Federal Office for Veterans Affairs"
DNF_Federal_Ministry_Of_Veterans_Affairs_desc: "The Bundesveteranenamt (Federal Office for Veterans Affairs) inauguration has become a matter of critical importance as disparities between pensions for Veterans between Federal Crownlands has come to a head. Presently the funds are disbursed from national treasuries, however the differences between tax incomes and financial solvency are causing issues where our Austrian and Bohemian veterans are drawing significantly larger pensions, even accounting for cost of living."
DNF_Modernise_Agriculture: "Modernise Agriculture"
DNF_Modernise_Agriculture_desc: "There are farms in Danubia that resemble the 18th century. We should make fertilisers more freely available, and provide loans from the Federal government to farmers to allow them to buy capital intensive equipment. We will see the returns in the bounty of their harvests."
DNF_Federal_Work_Commission: "Federal Work Commission"

DNF_Federal_Health_Service_desc: "'Illness is neither an indulgence for which people have to pay, nor an offence for which they should be penalised, but a misfortune the cost of which should be shared by the community.'\n\nDanubia should provide for the sick and the weary. The ability to go to a doctor without being concerned for the cost of a visit will hopefully provide a sufficient preventative and reduce cases where people wait until it is already too late to help them properly."
DNF_Support_Automotive_Industry: "Support the Automotive Industry"
DNF_Support_Automotive_Industry_desc: "The Automotive, whilst useful, is mostly viewed as a tool of business and is seen in the form of trucks and tractors. The government should popularise personal transportation, so that people might be able to live further away from the cities without concern for their employment or the train schedule."

DNF_The_Question_Of_Mitteleuropa: "The Mitteleuropa Question"
DNF_The_Question_Of_Mitteleuropa_desc: "We have been invited to Mitteleuropa on very decent terms. However we will need to ratify joining the economic bloc in the national diets due to devolved aspects of economic policy. However approving this in principle will put it on the agenda."
DNF_Renewing_Commission_Mandate: "Renewing the Von Mises Commission Mandate"
DNF_Renewing_Commission_Mandate_desc: "The Von Mises Commission has provided opportunities and supported regional development programs, however their mandate expired with the election. It is of importance that we renew their mandate so they can continue to investigate and discover opportunities within Danubia, and perhaps abroad too."
DNF_A_Social_Democratic_Economy: "Government-led Development"
DNF_A_Social_Democratic_Economy_desc: "The Von Mises Commission provided opportunities and supported regional development, however with the expiry of their mandate and certain political opposition within the SDAPD to a non-state body leading development efforts, the Federal government has decided to officially institute a Regional Development Commission as part of the Ministry of Finance."
DNF_Danube_Rhine_Export_Corridor: "Danube-Rhine Export Corridor"
DNF_Danube_Rhine_Export_Corridor_desc: "By developing the navigability of the Danube within the boards of the Federation as well as up-stream expansion of the Rhine-Danube canal by the Germans, the ability to transport goods via water from Budapest to Rotterdam promises to cut transportation costs and expand profit margins."
DNF_Improve_Border_Rail_Links: "Improve Border Rail Links"
DNF_Improve_Border_Rail_Links_desc: "With our accession to Mitteleuropa, the simplified customs regime has further increased the flow of goods between Danubia and the Mitteleuropan nations. Developing the rail links across the German border will reduce the strain on our transportation."
DNF_Trans_Alpine_Routes: "Expanding Trans-Alpine Routes"
DNF_Trans_Alpine_Routes_desc: "The Alps are both an amazing natural fastness, a great fortress, and a barricade to the flow of goods and materials. By boring tunnels for roads and railways through them, we can facilitate more movement between Italy and Germany, with the side benefit of developing a more remote region of Austria."
DNF_modernised_construction_techniques: "Modernised Construction Techniques"
DNF_modernised_construction_techniques_desc: "With the recent construction projects domestically, we have large construction companies that are competent and capable of immense projects.

DNF_Sarajevo_Concordat: "The Concordat of Sarajevo"
DNF_Sarajevo_Concordat_desc: "With the new democratic government in Serbia, we have finally managed to normalise relations between our two countries, allowing for eased movement across borders and removing the looming threat of irredentism. This has been partly achieved by providing investment funds for the counties on both sides of our shared border."
DNF_Bridging_The_Danube: "Bridging the Danube"
DNF_Bridging_The_Danube_desc: "A simple symbol of the new peace and amity between Serbia and Danubia is the construction of the Belgrade Peace Bridge across the Danube, allowing for eased transportation of goods and individuals across our mutual border. By simplifying the flow of goods and streamlining customs processes, we are all able to enjoy greater profits as the nations of the Danube no longer compete but co-operate."
DNF_Lower_Danube_Navigation_Treaty: "Lower Danube Navigation Treaty"
DNF_Lower_Danube_Navigation_Treaty_desc: "With the recent events in Romania, it seems only logical to extend the co-operation in the customs and economic sphere down river.

DNF_Pragmatic_Investments_desc: "By investing in some of the poorer regions of Danubia, we can increase the standard of living there, uplifting our fellow citizens into the modern era."
DNF_Reiterating_Danubian_Values: "Reiterating Danubian Values"
DNF_Reiterating_Danubian_Values_desc: "The values that the Danubian Federation is formed on are drawn from the reforms of Karl the Blessed. It cannot hurt to reiterate those underlying values of freedom, equality and brotherhood."
DNF_Danubian_Peoples_Community: "The Danubian People's Community"
DNF_Danubian_Peoples_Community_desc: "The people of Danubia are Danubians, not Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs or any other ethnic group. The corporate interest group, as defined by noted philosopher Othmar Spann, of Danubian Society is not the ethnic or social ties between citizens but rather the federal state.\n\nWe should ensure as a federal state to draw people together so they can be better cared for."
DNF_Implement_Cantonisation: "Implement Cantonisation of the Crownlands"
DNF_Implement_Cantonisation_desc: "The Cantonisation of the Crownlands is not the complete obliteration of the crownland structure itself, but rather a redrawing of the internal borders, breaking historical counties and borders to reflect the ethnic and social realities of the various peoples who live in Danubia. Having won an electoral mandate we can now proceed with this concept." 
DNF_Subsidise_Agriculture: "Subsidies for Agriculture"
DNF_Subsidise_Agriculture_desc: "There are still many people in Danubia who live in small villages and remote farmhouses, who make their living from the soil. We are an agrarian country, and supporting that is supporting Danubian culture."
DNF_Danubian_Identity: "Build the Danubian Identity"
DNF_Danubian_Identity_desc: "The Danubian supra-identity must be understood to be common and inclusive. Inclusion of the topic in educational materials and continued reminders to the population will help our nation-building project."
DNF_Canton_Economic_Specialisation_Programme: "Canton Economic Specialisation Programme"
DNF_Canton_Economic_Specialisation_Programme_desc: "Several of the new cantons are in regions which contain or revolve around the development a singular industry and it's ancillary operations. Additionally there are cantons in ports and cities that would provide opportunities for zones with varying economic regulations to promote development.\n\nIt makes good sense to fully embrace these industrial combines and regulatory opportunities within cantonal boundaries."
DNF_Federal_Chamber_Of_Commerce_And_Industry: "The Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry"
DNF_Federal_Chamber_Of_Commerce_And_Industry_desc: "By inaugurating the Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry the state is able to ensure that regulatory standards are developed uniformly and enforced. Additionally the Chamber can provide an additional channel for development grants for commercial interests and provide the capital for industrial loans that are in the national interest."
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_Raab: "In Danubia's Best Interests" 
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_Raab_desc: "We've set in motion a great deal, that will start to reshape the future of our country into something better. We must ensure that the country understands the import of what we are doing, and that it is in everyone's interests to proceed." 
DNF_Reconsider_Reichspakt_Alignment_Raab: "Reconsidering the Reichspakt"
DNF_Reconsider_Reichspakt_Alignment_Raab_desc: "The situation in Germany is, frankly, alarming. The democratic regime there, shaky at the best of times, is now nothing more than a sham due to the Prussian privilege and the Bredowist 'Neuer Staat'. We cannot stand idly by, working hand in hand with autocrats."

DNF_Developing_Mass_Housing: "Developing Mass Housing"
DNF_Developing_Mass_Housing_desc: "The Development of Housing for the Masses is something that can be improved.\n\nThe 'voter blocks' of Rote Wien stand as an example that we can build on for other cities within Danubia."
DNF_Reconciling_The_Hardliners: "Reconciling the Hardliner Faction"
DNF_Reconciling_The_Hardliners_desc: "The Hardliner Faction have their place in the government, but they also have their own agenda.\n\nThere has to be an alignment of our interests with theirs in order to ensure our political survival as a coherent party, or we will at some point be split and relegated to the opposition."
DNF_Building_Consensus: "Building Consensus"
DNF_Building_Consensus_desc: "If Alcide De Gasperi is known for anything, it is for his ability to find a compromise and rally people around that compromise.\n\nSocial reforms such as the ones planned require a broad social and political consensus that this is the correct path for the future, or they will be reversed the moment another government comes into office."
DNF_Reallocating_The_Budget: "Reallocating the Budget"
DNF_Reallocating_The_Budget_desc: "Given the post-war economic boom, the government is making more from taxable income than it has in decades. We should ensure that some of those dividends are returned to those people who need it in order to feed this cycle of economic development and innovation as part of our Christian distributivist ideal."
DNF_Rewriting_The_Nationalities_Act: "Amending the Nationalities Act"
DNF_Rewriting_The_Nationalities_Act_desc: "The De Gasperi solution to the issues faced by the minorities within the crownlands is to amend the nationalities act. Rather than having a majoritarian perspective with regard to social and linguistic rights within the crownlands, we will instead move towards a pluralist one, where each crownland will respect the rights of all minorities within it's borders.\n\nThis should soothe the issues we are seeing, though there will be some predictable nationalist reaction at this change."
DNF_The_Social_Housing_Program: "Expanding the Social Housing Stock"
DNF_The_Social_Housing_Program_desc: "The people of Danubia are ever more populous, and the amount of houses is not keeping up with their numbers. Development of new properties available to even the most destitute family, funded for and owned by the Crownland governments with Federal backing will help relieve pressure on the housing market.\n\nThese homes may not be much to look at but they will provide many Danubian families with their first opportunities to advance in life."
DNF_Pan_Europa_Projekt: "Pan-Europa Projekt"
DNF_Pan_Europa_Projekt_desc: "Danubia provides the example of a successful implementation of a multinational state within Europe. There is nothing to stop the promulgation of that idea beyond the boundaries of the Habsburg lands.\n\nFor too long Europe has been riven by war and nationalist discord. We should make a stand for a grander European project."
DNF_A_Christian_Danubia: "A Christian Danubia"
DNF_A_Christian_Danubia_desc: "The Christianity of the country and De Gasperi's own background in the Christian Democratic Party means that he sees the nation to be partly bound up in an inheritance that stretches to Rome and the Middle East. Indeed, the Kaiser still claims the Kingship of Jerusalem amongst his titles.\n\nTrying to segregate the state and religion from one another is a fool's errand, and not one the Minister President will follow."
DNF_Expanding_Employment_Legislation: "Expansion of Employment Legislation"
DNF_Expanding_Employment_Legislation_desc: "The protection of employee rights from discrimination, especially based on ethnic or gender basis is something that feeds right into support for the SDAPD.\n\nBy taking the initiative in this field, we are showing that the Balaton Bloc have more than a paternalistic attitude to the people of Danubia."
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_De_Gasperi: "In Danubia's Best Interests" 
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_De_Gasperi_desc: "We've set in motion a great deal, that will start to reshape the future of our country into something better. We must ensure that the country understands the import of what we are doing, and that it is in everyone's interests to proceed."

DNF_A_Federation_Of_Nations_desc: "Danubia is a Federation of Nations, but what that will look like will require us to figure out our position going forward. \n\nAre we going to build a Federation in extension of it's current image, or are we going to proceed with an agenda that is more ambitious?"
DNF_Economics_Of_Prosperity: "The Economics of Prosperity"
DNF_Economics_Of_Prosperity_desc: "Prosperity is a certain catchy word among those in power in Danubia, but true prosperity will derive from us expanding our offerings to the world. Releasing certain state controls and oversights on the economy will return greater profits for all."
DNF_Negotiating_A_New_Vision: "Negotiating a New Vision"
DNF_Negotiating_A_New_Vision_desc: "The Hardliner Faction have their place in the government, but they also have their own agenda.

DNF_Danubian_Personhood: "Creating Danubian Personhood"
DNF_Danubian_Personhood_desc: "We must promote the sensation of Danubian-ness, an identity that will exist alongside and above the individuals national or ethnic background. A unifying factor, something more coherent than the 'Kaisertreu' of the past."
DNF_Crownland_Development_Programme: "The Crownland Development Programme"
DNF_Crownland_Development_Programme_desc: "Centered through a new Federal Crownland Development Office, the programme aims to deal with more of the societal and social aspects of development, as opposed to the infrastructural and industrial."
DNF_Strength_In_Diversity: "Strength In Diversity"
DNF_Strength_In_Diversity_desc: "Danubia is a nation of multitudes, and those multitudes are it's strength. A nation with a Hungarian Minister-President, an Austrian Emperor, an army with Czech, Slovak and Illyrian generals, a cabinet with all of the above. From this diversity, the nation emerges stronger."
DNF_Social_Industrial_Complex: "Building a Social-Industrial Complex"
DNF_Social_Industrial_Complex_desc: "The Military-Industrial complex is a well known phenomenon - the alliance of the armed forces and industrial combines. We are going to provide a competing alignment.\n\nThe Social-Industrial axis will see government funding of development and planning of new towns and cities to ensure that the cities we have do not become sprawling, chaotic messes. The idea of urban planning is not new - the Ringstraße in Wien is testament to that, but we will build New Towns from scratch to meet our needs."
DNF_European_Heart_of_Innovation: "The European Heart of Innovation"
DNF_European_Heart_of_Innovation_desc: "Danubia has one of the greatest collections of scientific minds in the world, and we finally have the economy to support their experiments. Using the Crownland Development Office, we can support them and ensure that they have plenty of successors."

DNF_Gain_States_Approvals_PP: "Gaining Approvals at State Level"
DNF_Gain_States_Approvals_PP_desc: "While the Personal Principle has support at the Federal level throughout the SDAPD there are still many local particularisms that need to be dealt with, debates won and party districts brought into line at the regional level. If our voice is the same in each Diet in each country then the nations within a state will soon move toward our goal."
DNF_Evaluate_Overseas_Commitments: "Evaluate Our Overseas Commitments"
DNF_Evaluate_Overseas_Commitments_desc: "Is it in our interests to be potentially dragged into wars of aggression? To support imperialism abroad? Does our military really need quite the budget it has, given our position in Europe?\n\nThese are all questions we must consider and potentially start a national conversation on."
DNF_Underline_Dedication_To_Consociationalism: "Underlining Our Dedication To Consociationalism"
DNF_Underline_Dedication_To_Consociationalism_desc: "There are some excitable sorts who believe that the SDAPD leading the government in coalition is going to inevitably lead to some kind of Syndicalist coup and the murder of our beloved Kaiser.\n\nThis is not the case, but it does not hurt to make that point very clear. It will at least discredit those cranks on the right wing, who see Totalists lurking in every shadow and wage dispute."
DNF_Equalising_Prosperity: "Equalising Prosperity"
DNF_Equalising_Prosperity_desc: "Prosperity is practically a byword for Danubia today, however there are still a small contingent of persons who cannot find work, or are unable to work due to disability or infirmity or illness. Should we exclude them from the general rising tide because of this? We think not. Extension of the welfare system to maintain an acceptable standard of living is a vital policy."
DNF_Danubian_Economic_Theory: "Danubian Economic Theory"
DNF_Danubian_Economic_Theory_desc: "State economic interventions have a long history in Danubia. They have helped the country industrialise, laid thousands of kilometers of railway and generally helped to increase the standard of living. Continuing to expand the subsidisation of businesses given the current post-war economic boom seems only logical."
DNF_Review_Federal_Budgets: "Reviewing Federal Budget Expenditures"
DNF_Review_Federal_Budgets_desc: "The Federal Budget is burgeoning with potential and possibilities for the state. The question is how we wish to exercise the spending leverage we have, and whether we should consider raising taxation while the economy can stand it, in order to maintain national strategic reserves."
DNF_Introducing_Self_Management: "Introducing Self-Management"
DNF_Introducing_Self_Management_desc: "The Illyrian economic principle and practise of Worker Self-Management has shown great gains, providing incentives to the workers to keep their firm competitive and showing how the involvement of people from all levels within an organisation can provide valuable insights, as opposed to the authoritarian and hierarchical top-down model pursued in most industrial sectors. We are now going to move forward in providing the legal framework for this on a federal level."
DNF_Try_To_Defuse_Global_Tensions_Scharf: "Trying To Defuse Global Tensions"
DNF_Try_To_Defuse_Global_Tensions_Scharf_desc: "The elephant in the room is the atom bomb. Perhaps by creating an organisation which the nuclear powers would agree to some form of visibility and regulation, or at least a nuclear deals clearing house, we can calm matters."
DNF_Foreign_Domestic_Policy_Alignment: "Aligning Our Foreign and Domestic Policy"	
DNF_Foreign_Domestic_Policy_Alignment_desc: "Our current disparity in Foreign Policy and Domestic Policy are causing more and more headaches for our ministers and diplomats. Significant portions of the party rank and file are expressing their disappointment that we continue ventures abroad that conflict with our professed ideals that we are implementing at home.\n\nThey are right to do so. We must act on this clear imperative."	
DNF_Gain_Popular_Approval: "Gaining Popular Approval"
DNF_Gain_Popular_Approval_desc: "The people must be led to understanding, that is the duty of the social democratic party. Something well understood by our Austro-Marxist contingent as well. It is not enough for us to simply convince their representatives, we must explain to them, in detail and yet simply enough that any can understand how we are going to open up their world. No longer will the vaguaries of the map wholly determine the opportunities one might face in life. This must be reiterated over and over, until it is understood by the simplest farmhand as well as the intellectual in their academic seat of learning."
DNF_Personal_Prinzip_p51: "The Personal Prinzip"
DNF_Personal_Prinzip_p51_desc: "The concept of National Personal Autonomy (hereafter referred to as the Personal Prinzip) is the logical conclusion of the fact that Danubia is a consociational state - that is one that requires powersharing between the different disparent groups within it. Whilst we can hope for, and promote a Danubian identity, it must be one that contains multitudes.\n\nA plurinational state is the only cure for nationalism, and by definition it must therefore acknowledge and support the nationalities within its borders, whilst allowing individuals of those nationalities to navigate their lives without ever feeling that the state makes some unwarranted distinction based on physical location or national identity. \n\nAfter a long struggle, we are finally able to bring this into law."
DNF_Building_New_Institutions: "Building New State Institutions"
DNF_Building_New_Institutions_desc: "The institutions of the Federal State must be expanded and new offices created to take over those functions previously fulfilled by the crownlands. This process will take some time as simply shuttering the national offices would be seen as a centralising power grab. Instead we must employ our energies to co-ordinate the apparatus of the state across the body of the Federation."
DNF_The_Danubia_Plan: "The Danubia Plan"
DNF_The_Danubia_Plan_desc: "Development of the Danubian State must proceed in an orderly and logical fashion. While we are not against private enterprise, there is no shame in the state also providing the means and motivations for the country to advance further. Only radical market-economists would dispute this basic fact.\n\nSo the state has drawn up the Danubia Development Plan (though it's often referred to as just the Danubia Plan, even within high office). In it, the tools are provided to ensure that economic interventions by the state can be made to support strategic commercial, military and resource extraction ventures, in the national interest."
DNF_Reconsider_Reichspakt_Alignment_Scharf: "Reconsidering the Reichspakt"
DNF_Reconsider_Reichspakt_Alignment_Scharf_desc: "The situation in Germany is, frankly, alarming.

DNF_Commitment_To_Minorities_In_Government_desc: "Despite the promises of liberty and equality, a great number of leadership positions in Federal Government are still held by Germans and Hungarians. The Veres government and the Agrarian party have many members who are from other national groups, and as such it would behoove us to clear the way to represent them at higher levels.\n\nOur federation will only grow stronger by showing people that they are truly all part of it."
DNF_Agrarian_Foreign_Policy: "Defining our Foreign Policy Position"

DNF_Work_With_CS_On_Social_Issues: "Work with the Balaton Bloc on Social Issues"
DNF_Work_With_CS_On_Social_Issues_desc: "The Balaton Bloc came forward with good ideas for social development for Danubia. Working with them on this topic will strengthen our coalition agreement and allow for some commonality and continuity in our policy making."
DNF_Maintain_Fractuous_Coalition: "Maintain the Fractuous Coalition"
DNF_Maintain_Fractuous_Coalition_desc: "Tension between the FBLP and the Balaton Bloc is flaring up with the Agrarians in the middle. Minister-President Veres has to make a decision about who to try and appeal to, at least for the moment, to keep things calm."
DNF_Rally_The_Agrarian_Parties: "Rally The Agrarian Parties"
DNF_Rally_The_Agrarian_Parties_desc: "The Agrarian bloc across Danubia has the potential to be more forceful. Right now, between the Balaton Bloc and the SDAPD we are pushed around, and not able to perform at the same level. The Minister-President must rally the parties to build support across the nation and overcome the issues we are seeing within the government."
DNF_Break_With_the_fblp: "Break with the FBLP"
DNF_Break_With_the_fblp_desc: "The Föderation der Bürgerlichen und Liberalen Parteien (Federation of Civic and Liberal Parties) were the coalition partner that helped us get into office. However if we feel that the Agrarians are having a hard time being heard, they are the most junior partner and one of the most persistently upset at being ignored or overridden. We would still be able to hold government, and pursue our policies more fully, should we let them go back into the political wilderness."
DNF_Develop_Social_Welfare: "Develop the Social Welfare Programme"
DNF_Develop_Social_Welfare_desc: "Free of the Market economists insistence that 'state interventions in the economy only lead to disaster' we can now expand the Social Welfare net in co-ordination with our allies in the Balaton Bloc."
DNF_Promote_Agrarian_Policies: "Promote Agrarian Policies"
DNF_Promote_Agrarian_Policies_desc: "A lot of the time the Agrarian policy is something that overlies an existing Balaton Bloc policy, or concept. We have to make sure our own ideas are clearly shared and understood by the people, that they know where their government gets it's ideas from, and what those ideas actually are and how they help people."
DNF_Break_With_CS: "Break with the Balaton Bloc"
DNF_Break_With_CS_desc: "The Balaton Bloc hold approximately fifty percent of our government's seats in the Federal diet. However their historic presence in government means they act like we are the junior partner and they can dictate their policy to us. We can step away from them, and we will reach out to the SDAPD to try and remain in government."
DNF_Develop_Neutrality_Philosophy: "Develop Neutrality Philosophy"
DNF_Develop_Neutrality_Philosophy_desc: "Our position in the world is such that we should be neutral in the affairs of the great powers. The Kalterkrieg is not our affair.

DNF_Assure_The_Kaiser: "Assure the Kaiser"
DNF_Assure_The_Kaiser_desc: "The Kaiser is understandably concerned - for most of his lifetime the Grand Coalition in some form has been in charge of the nation. That we have then had this kind of upheaval and disruption... it is unsurprising he wants additional assurances from the Minister-President that he will not be hurting the future of the nation."
DNF_Develop_A_Computer_Industry: "Developing a Computing Industry"
DNF_Develop_A_Computer_Industry_desc: "The idea of thinking machines as proposed by Janos Von Neumann and the development of this technology holds vast potential implications. The government should ensure there is support in order to develop this technology so that Danubia does not fall behind the curve in the development of devices and machines that will ease computational requirements on labour."
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_Veres: "Holding the Veres Government Together"
DNF_Danubias_Best_Interest_Veres_desc: "Our coalition partners are intolerable. But we are really out of alternative options. At this point we must try and limp to the finish line, and avoid any no-confidence votes or coalition fractures."

DNF_The_1955_Election: "The 1955 Election Commences"
DNF_The_1955_Election_desc: "The Danubian Federal Election of 1955 will determine the look of the Federal Diet, and who will lead the government for the next four years. With the events of the last few years, it seems the only true contenders will be the SDAPD and the Balaton Bloc, with the Liberal Coalition having fragmented along regional lines. \n\nA groundswell of support seems to be toward the SDAPD, but the Balaton Bloc still has a chance at victory if they give a strong campaign."
DNF_The_SDAPD_55: "Everyone For Danubia"
DNF_The_SDAPD_55_desc: "The SDAPD stands for the rights of the people, for the voice of the masses to be heard and developments within the Danubian Federation to happen organically. They question the division of the world into two armed camps and believe that Danubia's role in world politics is one to herald peace globally."
DNF_The_Rising_Tide: "Ride the Red Wave"
DNF_The_Rising_Tide_desc: "The zeitgeist of our times is in our favour. The political ideas of the SDAPD are further disseminated than ever before as the urban masses grow in number and become conscious of their situation.\n\nIt goes without saying that we should seek to expand our party organisation, mobilise the people actively, and seek to lead Danubia into a brighter future where the masses have the voice they deserve."
DNF_Universal_Suffrage: "The Final Opening of Suffrage"
DNF_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "Universal Suffrage is an achievable goal - the fact that there are still age differences between male and female voters in this day and age speaks, unfortunately, to the outmoded and backward thinking nature of some more of the rural parts of the country that certain parties seek to pander to.\n\nAn age of eighteen for both genders, without property requirement or other barrier should be pursued."
DNF_Social_Democratic_Modes_Of_Production: "Social Democratic Modes of Production"
DNF_Social_Democratic_Modes_Of_Production_desc: "The intertwining of state and industrial combine threatens to choke the democracy out of our country. Certain groups within the Balaton Bloc subscribe to corporatist ideas that would minimise individual agency into mere 'interest groups' to be managed by the state and business.\n\nWe need to ardently pursue a political agenda aimed towards encouraging more worker involvement in decision making."
DNF_Freedom_Of_Assembly: "Freedom of Assembly"
DNF_Freedom_Of_Assembly_desc: "The fear of Syndicalism still runs so deep in this country that there are laws against the assembly of workers. These fears are frankly excessive and while there exists a fringe of authoritarian socialists out there, their role is vastly overblown.\n\nThe SDAPD represents the majority of leftist thought within Danubia and the workingmen's associations, unions and worker's aid councils should not be afraid of their meetings being raided and broken up by police called for and egged on by right-wing cranks with spurious grounds."
DNF_Tackling_Vested_Interests: "Tackling Vested Interests"
DNF_Tackling_Vested_Interests_desc: "The alignment of capital, landowners and aristocrats is ultimately one against the working class. This is not necessarily outright class warfare, but it is a truth that too many prefer not to acknowledge as it is an uncomfortable one.\n\nAs the working class grows, we must therefore stand for their rights and ensure they do not fall prey to rentier landlords and abusive industrial combines who view them as nothing more than fodder to keep their wallets fat and the machinery working."
DNF_Polanyi_Contribution: "Polányi's Contribution "
DNF_Polanyi_Contribution_desc: "Once the free market attempts to separate itself from the fabric of society, social protectionism is society's natural response. This is Karol Polányi's 'double movement'. \n\nPolanyi does not see economics as a subject closed off from other fields of enquiry and indeed that economic and social problems are inherently linked. He states that the ultimate solution will be a socialist society, noting, \"after a century of blind 'improvement', man is restoring his 'habitation.'\""
DNF_A_Pluralist_Campaign: "A Pluralist Campaign"
DNF_A_Pluralist_Campaign_desc: "This is our land, a land of peace and of plenty, a land of harmony and hope. This is our land. Danubia... These are our people, the workers, the strivers, the builders...\n\nThe SDAPD is an organisation that is open to all, regardless of ethnic background or social standing. The strength of the great river of leftist intellectual development in this country is comparable only to that which gives the land its name."
DNF_The_CSP_55: "Maintain 'The Course'"
DNF_The_CSP_55_desc: "Danubia is a great nation. It is a great nation because of the stewardship of the Balaton Bloc, who are carefully seeking to guide the country into the brave new future."
DNF_Navigating_The_Kalterkrieg: "Navigating the Kalterkrieg"
DNF_Navigating_The_Kalterkrieg_desc: "In the past several years the global forces that were once united against the spectre of Syndicalism have fallen further and further into two armed camps - the German centred Reichspakt and the Anglo-French Accord. This cannot be ignored nor forgotten. Tensions between the two threaten to eclipse all of civilisation in disaster.\n\nThe Balaton Bloc have a vision to keep Danubia both relevant and able to put our finger on the scale to avert confrontations between the two.\n\nDanubia will remain a force for peace in the world."
DNF_Maintaining_Our_Readiness: "Maintaining Our Readiness"
DNF_Maintaining_Our_Readiness_desc: "Danubia's Gemeinsame Armee, Imperial Navy and the Air wings are some of the most technologically advanced and prepared military forces in the world. This preparedness and cutting edge development however has a cost that is both budgetary and social.\n\nOur opponents like to deride the military budget and frequently seek to cut it, however the Balaton Bloc know that it is a necessary price in order for Danubia to maintain peace."
DNF_The_Party_Of_Peace: "The Party of Peace"
DNF_The_Party_Of_Peace_desc: "Tacitus famously said 'if you wish for peace, prepare for war'. The Balaton Bloc has a deep desire for peace, but we are well aware that the world as it is requires men of resolve to defend it, men who are perhaps nasty and scary...\n\nThey will be men who are willing to hurt our enemies, so that our people may sleep peacefully in their beds at night."
DNF_State_Economic_Involvement: "State Economic Interventions"
DNF_State_Economic_Involvement_desc: "Certain strategic sectors of the economy should be supported by the government, regardless of what the FBLP, policy think tanks and the Von Mises Commission state. The current global environment and the pressures of the Kalterkrieg require a strong domestic industrial base in Danubia. \n\nThe state supporting and developing industry cannot be allowed to be captured as a Social Democrat policy, so the Balaton Bloc is making it clear their own ties to business are more than just good relations with the Industrial Combines."
DNF_Military_Industrial_Complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
DNF_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "A great number of the civilian aviation, commercial vehicle and consumer goods manufacturers in Danubia are subsidiaries or owned by holding companies that also have a defence manufacturing concern. Through government purchases (and international sales), the developments from the defence manufacturers are filtering into commercially available products. This then makes our products more generally competitive on the global markets.\n\nSupporting our defence manufacturers improves everyone's standard of living."
DNF_Corporatist_Developments: "Christian-Corporatist Developments"
DNF_Corporatist_Developments_desc: "'The corporate group that forms the basis of Danubian society is not the ethnic or social ties between citizens but rather the federal state.' This is the thought of the late professor Othmar Spann. Whilst politically active during his lifetime, re-evaluation of his theories in the face of growing Social Democratic upswell provides some basis for the evolution of thought espoused by the Balaton Bloc to compete. \n\nThere is a concern among some that 'pure' Christian Democracy is not appealing to voters, and they're picking up Spann's ideas as a natural development to be explored."
DNF_Bulwark_Against_Tyranny: "A Bulwark Against Tyranny"
DNF_Bulwark_Against_Tyranny_desc: "The Balaton Bloc stands for the rights of personal freedom, peace at both home and abroad, and the continuation of the Danubian Federation playing a role in world politics against the impositions of tyrants. The fact that the world has fallen into two armed camps is a reality that must be dealt with, rather than daydreamed away."

DNF_The_Election_Concludes_55_desc: "After a close fought and rousing campaign, the people go to the polls across our great land, casting their votes for the politicians on the Federal Party lists. Exit polls provided by Donausfoederationsfunk (DFF) put the popularities of the heavyweights at \nSDAPD: [?DNF_55_SDAPD] \nBalaton Bloc: [?DNF_55_CSP]\n\nGiven only two parties really gave a showing this year, observers are commenting on the apparent increased level of polarisation in Danubian society."

DNF_Call_On_The_Silent_Majority_desc: "There is a rising tide of Social Democratic thought across Danubia, and even more who are swept up in the countercultural movement that views certain behaviours and music as an expression against the discourse of the majority.\n\nThe Silent Majority are those who do not take part in such nonsense, and their support will be vital for the Balaton Bloc going forward."

DNF_Lean_Into_Danubian_Identity_desc: "The Danubian Federation is the boldest experiment in modern history and the social identity constructed by this reformulation of the state deserves our full support. \n\nCounterculturalism will have the wind taken out of it's sails by our co-opting of it's language and concepts, reshaping them into something palatable to all."
DNF_Starting_A_Managed_Democracy: "Starting a Managed Democracy"
DNF_Starting_A_Managed_Democracy_desc: "Our democracy is very important. However the results of elections in relations to the ultimate hold on power are tenuous at best. The Grand Coalition has been in government in the Danubian for practically it's entire existence. \n\nWe should acknowledge this fact, and start planning on how to ensure that stability and order are continuous within this political framework, whilst defending against extra-parliamentary opposition groups."
DNF_Using_New_Media: "Using New Media"
DNF_Using_New_Media_desc: "Television is a fantastic new device, and the sales of such objects are continuously rising as they become more and more affordable. We should ensure that the broadcast content is not just comedies of the lowest common denominator and dry news information.\n\nDanubia needs to know what the government is doing for them."
DNF_Accelerate_Polarisation: "Accelerate Polarisation"
DNF_Accelerate_Polarisation_desc: "There is a sense of political polarisation in recent years - you are either a Balatonist or an SDAPD supporter. This is ultimately beneficial as long as the two parties remain in coalition with one another, as we suck the oxygen out of the room for smaller parties by dominating the news cycle.\n\nIt should therefore follow we should not be afraid to be more aggressive in public, so that we might retain the focus on our policy, and bring the country into our camp, or that of our coalition partners."
DNF_Defining_Danubian_Interests: "Defining Danubian Interests"
DNF_Defining_Danubian_Interests_desc: "It is of great importance that Danubia's interests are clearly delineated, so that we can expend our energy in a logical fashion rather than haphazardly fight fires as they rise up and threaten to destroy the whole edifice of the nation.\n\nBuilding on our supra-national identity requires a clear vision for where our country is going and what we expect the future to look like.

DNF_New_Federalism_desc: "The Balaton agreements with the additionally recently strengthened Federal centre are enough. There are too many attempts to curtail the powers of the crownlands, when they are perfectly suited to the role they fulfil.

DNF_Countering_The_Red_Wave_desc: "Leftist political thought seems to have captured the zeitgeist of our times. It is no longer enough to simply react to the events as they crop up. The state must engage in active counter-measures, lest we be swept out of government on the back of a red wave."

DNF_Extending_The_Franchise: "Extending the Franchise"
DNF_Extending_The_Franchise_desc: "The history of the extension of Suffrage in Danubia is one that has been gradual, and has always had requirements, initially of property, then of education.\n\nThe current incarnation still requires an age greater than 23 for women, and a university degree whilst a man merely has to be 18 and not a felon. Having won a mandate at the election to extend this to the point of equality, the time is ripe."
DNF_Social_Democratic_Modes_Of_Production_1: "Social Democratic Modes of Production"
DNF_Social_Democratic_Modes_Of_Production_1_desc: "The intertwining of state and industrial combine threatens to choke the democracy out of our country. Certain groups within the Balaton Bloc subscribe to corporatist ideas that would minimise individual agency into mere 'interest groups' to be managed by the state and business.\n\nWe need to ardently pursue a political agenda aimed towards encouraging more worker involvement in decision making."
DNF_Removing_Barricades_To_Assembly: "Removing Barricades to Freedom of Assembly"
DNF_Removing_Barricades_To_Assembly_desc: "The fear of Syndicalism still runs so deep in this country that there are laws against the assembly of workers. These fears are overblown and while there exists a fringe of authoritarian socialists out there, their role is vastly overblown.\n\nThe SDAPD represents the majority of leftist thought within Danubia and the self-managing workers meetings should not be at risk of interruption by police raids instigated by corporate owners."
DNF_Tackling_Vested_Interests_Scharf: "Tackling Vested Interests"
DNF_Tackling_Vested_Interests_Scharf_desc: "The alignment of capital, landowners and aristocrats is ultimately one against the working class. This is not necessarily outright class warfare, but it is a truth that too many prefer not to acknowledge as it is an uncomfortable one.\n\nHaving won an electoral mandate promising to tackle these interests we can now pursue housing and rent reforms as wall as solidifying worker's rights in law."

DNF_Expanding_State_Ownership_desc: "After the implementation of the Personal Princip, the Federal Government inherited MAVAG - the Hungarian State Railways - from the Hungarian Crownland.\n\nHaving ran it efficiently and undercutting competitor services in the process, it is felt by many that the state should hold this key industrial sector directly across the entirety of the Danubian Federation."

### Leader Descriptions ###

  POLITICS_KARL_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nAugust 17th, 1887\nPersenbeug-Gottsdorf, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\nWhen he was coronated Kaiser in the heart of the Weltkrieg, few expected much from Karl von Habsburg. Thrust into a position he wasn't supposed to be in, the masses believed the inexperienced noble was massively out of his depth, and would lead Austria-Hungary to ruin. And people have never been more wrong.\n\nStarting with the Volkermanifest of 1918, Karl worked tirelessly to save the Empire. His plans were thought to be insane, impossible in the face of rising nationalism. But he persevered, for the sake of his people. Cisleithania would be federalised in the late 20s, though the Hungarian nationalists almost derailed everything. But in 1939, after the F48P fell and Hungary finally recognised the need for reform, his mission would be complete. The proclaimation of the Danubian Federation, a nation built on equality, democracy and pluralism, validated his every wish.\n\nDespite being a man of peace, the threat of Savinkov and the Internationale would drive Karl to intervene in the Second Weltkrieg, saving the German Empire in their time of strife. Together, the "brothers" beat back the invaders, and in military victory Danubia would truly rise to a superpower, surpassing even Karl's wildest dreams. To everyone in Danubia, Karl is beloved, hailed as a hero, a savior, even a saint. His hatred of political partisanship has helped to shape a moderate nation, where all voices are heard in equal measure. But the Reformer is ill. An extended history of stress and health problems over his 32 year reign has turned the once ambitious young man into an old, frail one. Now, all of the people of Danubia are asking themselves a punishing question...\n\nWhat happens when their founding father is gone?"

  POLITICS_OTTO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember 20th, 1912\nReichenau an der Rax, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\nBorn to the palace, Otto has been brought up to be a Catholic Monarch by his mother, and a good man by his father. He has strived to be both, whilst also developing an interest in Pan-Europeanism as a panacea for the continent's two plagues, war and poverty.\n\nWar has been the backdrop to his life, first the Weltkrieg which swirled through the first decade of his life, and now as an adult the second one, that served as a backdrop to his ascent to the throne. All of this war has borne within the young Kaiser a deep and abiding interest in peace. His desire for peace has not lead him to seek to control others however, rather he is patient, thoughtful and attentive. He listens, and seeks compromises acceptable to both parties.\n\nHis education was not simply in Saints, morals and manners however, he speaks almost every language of Danubia fluently as well as French and Latin. He also went to university and attained a Doctorate in Political and Social Sciences from the University of Louvain in Belgium. His thesis was on 'the right, born of usage and of the peasant law of inheritance, of the indivisibility of rural land ownership in Austria'.\n\nWell travelled, and since his father's last health scare, increasingly well prepared to rule, Otto looks to set Danubia on a course that is determinably pointed toward Peace.\n\nThe question is whether his popularity will persist and allow him to pull Danubia along behind him."

  POLITICS_ALCIDE_DE_GASPERI_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 3rd, 1881\nTesin, Trentino-Südtirol, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LAlcide Amedeo Francesco De Gasperi grew up in the South Tyrol, and while he was anti-Germanisation he was never pro-reunification, which made him somewhat unique amongst his contemporaries. He spent some time editing the Italian language newspaper La Voce Cattolica before going into politics in 1911. He lead the Unione Politica Popolare del Trentino, which merged into the Christian Democratic Party of Austria in December 1920.\n\nHis agenda has always been to improve the opportunities for those minorities unrepresented by the Staatsrecht system, within that system. He was also involved in Kaiser Karl's attempts to find Honorable Peace in the First Weltkrieg.\n\nA man of peace, with strong Christian Democratic credentials, in the years between the Weltkriegs he rose as far as the Speaker of the Federal Diet. During the war he made sure the Diet functioned smoothly and helped the government pass legislation effectively and quickly when needed.\n\nHe has a reputation of a pragmatic statesman, and represents a steady pair of hands to manage Danubia now that the storm of war has passed."

  POLITICS_KARL_RENNER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 14th, 1870\nUnter Tannowitz, Südmähren, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LThe 'Father of the Grand Coalition' and chairman of the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Donausfoederation, Karl Renner has come far from his humble origins as one of eighteen children, son of poor wine-growers.\nFormer Reichsrat Parliamentary Librarian he has published on the matter of the nationalities question Danubia since 1899 under various aliases, initially fearful of losing his privileged role in the legal institution.\n\nIndeed the Austro-Marxist ideals that formed the basis of the 'Personal Prinzip' of national personal autonomy were formulated in part by Renner, and were pushed by the 'Rotes-Österreich'  government that he lead in the 1930's to Balaton.\nThe Balaton Principles ultimately did not align with that idea and the Danubian Federation took on a different character.\n\nForced by electoral mathematics to be the junior partner in the political equation, the short-lived Dollfuß government has given him one last chance to try and make the change he believes is needed for Danubia, if he can get the votes for it."

  POLITICS_JULIUS_RAAB_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember  29th, 1891\nSankt Pölten, Niederösterreich, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LJulius Raab is the son of a middle-class Catholic family, and a master builder. Following in his father's footsteps he enrolled at the Technische Universität Wien to study civil engineering. Drafted to fight in the First Weltkrieg in 1914, he served as a pioneer officer and returned to university after the war, engaging in politics at the same time. However he dropped out after his father died in 1925 and went into politics full time.\n\nHe immediately joined up to run for a diet seat as a member of the Christian Democratic Party, in the same electoral intake as Engelbert Dollfuß and Kurt Schussnigg. Since then he's proven to have a head for figures despite his lack of a completed degree, and served first as Commerce and Trade minister, and then was promoted to the Finanzamt when his predecessor retired. Wilhelm Miklas took a personal shine to his Finanzminister and gave him the advice and guidance that polished the rough edges off him.\n\nRaab is in some respects Wilhelm Miklas's protege, and represents a continuation of his political legacy. Raab will manage the peace that Wilhelm Miklas envisioned, no doubt."

  POLITICS_ENGELBERT_DOLLFUSS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 4th, 1892\nTexingtal, Niederösterreich, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LEngelbert Dollfuß was always destined to serve his country. When he was at university when the First Weltkrieg broke out, he was rejected by the Wien draft due to his height. Undeterred he went to Sankt Pölten and insisted on joining the war effort. The draft board recruited him and he served in the Kaiserschützen, since as a volunteer he could choose his regiment.\n\nAfter the war ended he returned to University, where he was involved with the Niederösterreichischer Bauernverband. His organisational skills soon marked him out for a full-time role working for the Balaton Bloc, studying Christian Principles in Economics at the Technische Universität Wien before graduating. He then ran for political office and gained a Federal Diet seat for his trouble. His organising talent was put to work, as the Federal Minister for Railways his purview extended across the entire Danubian railway network.\n\nHe has been involved there since 1933, whilst occasionally filling other minister portfolios when the incumbent has retired or stepped aside. After a decade and a half of work, there is no joke when people comment that 'Dollfuß makes the trains run on time'. Using extraordinary measures during the Second Weltkrieg he was able to temporarily assume full control of the Federal and state railways, which some credit to helping play a role in the Danubian victory.\n\nSuch a man is known for his liking of order, simplicity and predictability in all things. He loathes the hand-wringing, complex positions of the Social Democrats, and he believes that God lights the path that he must follow to preserve the country he loves."

  POLITICS_ZOLTAN_TILDY_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 24th, 1875\nLosonc, Mittelslowakei, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LZoltán Tildy was the son of a Hungarian official in the local government. He took a degree in theology from the Reformed Theological Academy in Pápa, afterwards spending a year studying at Assembly's College, Belfast, in Ireland. Tildy served as an active minister of the Reformed Church beginning in 1921, and edited the daily paper of the Reformed church in Hungary, the Keresztény Család (Christian Family), as well as other periodicals. In 1929, Tildy joined the Országos Kisgazda- és Földmüves Párt and soon gravitated to the leadership of the party through his strong personality and his organisational talent. By 1948 he was the spokesman of the informally referred to 'Minority Bloc' in the Federal Party.\n\nA strong proponent of Christian Democracy and Christian economic values through the lense of big business and also with close ties to the Hungarian Agrarian movement, a Tildy government will probably see more prominent politicians who are not of German stock, and close ties between the industrial combines and the state apparatus."

  POLITICS_WILHELM_MIKLAS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 15th, 1872\nKrems, Niederösterreich, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn as the son of a post official in Krems, in the Cisleithanian crown land of Lower Austria, Miklas graduated from high school at Seitenstetten and went on to study history and geography at the University of Vienna. From 1905 to 1922, Miklas was headmaster of the Federal Secondary School in Horn, a small town in the Lower Austrian Waldviertel region. In 1907, Miklas was elected to the Imperial Council (Reichsrat) parliament as a member of the Christlichsoziale Partei. Re-elected in 1911, Miklas held a parliamentary seat for the CSP for the next three decades, serving as state secretary when appointed in 1919 and from 1923 to 1928, he was the speaker of the National Council (Nationalrat).\n\nFinally in 1939 after the first Danubian Federal Election, Miklas became CSP chairman when Otto Ender refused to work with the SDAPD to form The Grand Coalition against the wishes of his party, and was so forced to resign.\n\nNine long years later, the strain of the Second Weltkrieg has left this politician now looking eagerly to his impending retirement. He led the country to victory, through the fires of war and the ascent of Otto to the throne after his father's death. He gave many stirring speeches about the need to bend their backs to win a victory, not for imperial adventure or vendetta, but for the chance of lasting peace in Europe. \n\nNow he'll shape that peace, at least in Danubia, and then he'll probably let someone else take on the hard work of maintaining it, while he retires to a Viennese cafe to enjoy the fruits of his labours."

  POLITICS_PETER_VERES_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 6th 1897\nNeustadt auf d. Heiduckenboden, Heiduckenkomitat, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn as the bastard son of a maid and a wealthy peasant in Neustadt auf d. Heiduckenboden, in the crown land of St. Stephan, Péter Veres has come far indeed. During the First Weltkrieg he served on the Italian front as a conscript, he married Julianna Nádasdi in 1919 after the war ended, from whom he had five children, the eldest son of whom, Péter Nádasdi, was born in 1920 and also became a writer. As time went by he expressed his opinion in passionate journalistic writings on the most burning social issues of the age (popular-urban opposition, responsibility of the Hungarians, the fate of the nation). Within the camp of folk writers, he was an advocate of an idealised rural agrarianism, but he was also influenced by racial and nationalist views. Towards the end of the 1930s, he maintained close contact with the left-wing movements including the most influential organization among the contemporary intellectuals, the Turul Association, which had a strong popular wing and social program at the time, and a similar far-right association linking the problems of the poor peasantry.\n\nA fellow-traveller of Nationalists and Syndicalists, he spent a portion of the Second Weltkrieg in jail by state order to defend against his national-syndicalist attitudes. After his stint in jail he claimed a reformed political viewpoint and joined the Progressive Democrats and Agrarians Hungarian wing, moving quickly to the top of the organisation due to his oratorical skills and the respect of his fellows.\n\nHe has now managed to lead the FBLP and Agrarian coalition to a stunning victory and finds himself the head of the Danubian Federation. The question is whether his change of heart is authentic, or if Danubia is about to embark on a radical experiment indeed, and whether his coalition will follow him through it."

  POLITICS_ADOLF_SCHARF_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 20th 1890\nNikolsburg, Südmähren, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn into a poor working class family, Schärf moved to Vienna at age 9. A talented young man, he put himself through law-school while working part time and having won a scholarship. At the end of the First Weltkrieg he was discharged from the army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He worked as a secretary under the tutelage of fellow South Moravian, Karl Renner in the SDAPD.\n\nThis closeness and similar background to the esteemed gentleman of Danubian Austro-Marxism meant that his own ascent to political power was that of the protege. In his spare time, he managed to pass the Inner Austrian bar and worked as an attorney to further the SDAPD cause in the judicial system on occasion.\n\nWith recent events, his slow climb to the peak of Danubian politics has now been completed, and the question is now, what is to be done? Adolf Schärf is considered a safe pair of hands by many in the SDAPD, and his closeness with Karl Renner will probably mean his policies will be in a similar vein."

  POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 7th 1892\nKumrovec, Kroatische Bergland, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn into a family so poor that after completing his primary education, and being apprenticed to a locksmith, Josip Broz had to buy his own work clothes because his father could not afford them, the man has come far from humble origins. Conscripted into the army in 1913 for his mandatory two year term, he was sent to fight against Serbia in 1914, then Russia on the Galician front in 1915 where he was recommended for an award after the scout platoon he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive.\n\nAfter a stint in the Russian Prisoner of War camp systems and some hard labour on the Trans-Siberian Railway, he escaped Russia with the signing of the peace, crossing the Ukrainian border with a number of other Croat POWs who had escaped their camp and ridden freight trains westwards. He returned to Austria-Hungary with a wife, and for a time lived in Zagreb, being involved in a Waiters strike in the city and making connections with the more radical elements of the Social Democratic party there. He found trouble maintaining long-term employment due to these associations, however his fiery speeches and political acumen got him a job inside the party apparatus.\n\nSince those early days he has worked tirelessly to better his life, and to push his convictions, becoming the Minister-President first of Illyria, and then after some factional chicanery within the SDAPD, Minister-President of Danubia."

  POLITICS_LEOPOLD_FIGL_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 2nd 1902\nRust im Tullnerfeld, Niederösterreich, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n§LBorn a farmer's son with eight siblings (four brothers, four sisters), Leopold Figl's father died when he was 12. Despite this setback, his mother sent him to the Gymasium in Sankt Polten, where he met his future colleague in politics, Julius Raab and founded the Middle School Association Nibelungia with him.\n\nGraduating with an Engineer's Diploma in Agriculture from the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences Vienna, he became involved in politics in Lower Austria, whilst finding time to marry his wife Hilde Hemala in 1930.\n\nFrom there he has been involved in foreign policy at the federal level for some time, holding the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs for several years under the Balaton Bloc, and most famously coming up with the "Mitteleuropäisches Wiederaufbauprogramm" for reconstruction of Europe.\n\nHis rise to the top has been patient, slow, and cunning. The question now is whether this approach will serve Danubian interests in the shifting landscapes of the Kalterkrieg."
