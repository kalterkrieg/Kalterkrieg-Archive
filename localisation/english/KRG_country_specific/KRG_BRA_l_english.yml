BRA_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "§LPartido Sindicalista Brasileiro§! (Brazilian Syndicalist Party)\n§LDespite having never been poweful enough to seriously threaten the political establishment, the last ten years have been particularly harsh to the Brazilian Syndicalist Party. The target of severe state persecution beginning in the Vargas years, the party was further weakened by the defeat of the Syndicalist powers in 1947. Right now, the PSB survives solely on the popularity of the "Knight of Hope", the old Tenente Luís Carlos Prestes.§!"

(Socialist Democratic Union - Radicals)\n§LAt a time when leftists were being arrested in the thousands, João Mangabeira was the one to stand up and denounce what he perceived as grave violations of Brazil's democratic liberties. Perhaps owing to his connections to his brother Otávio, João was able to serve untouched as "Brazil's conscience" during those dark years. Following the restoration of the '27 Constitution in 1943, Mangabeira gathered his old followers of the Democratic Left and formed the even looser "Socialist Democratic Union", which even includes disillusioned ex-Syndicalists.§!"

BRA_revolutionary_republican_party: "PSR"
BRA_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "§LPartido Social Republicano§! (Social Republican Party)\n§LBeing mainly the \"party of opposition\", the party is an idiosyncratic coalition of regional interests who stand against the hegemony of the Liberal Party. Traditionally strong in Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, and among the working class of Rio de Janeiro, the party was founded by the remaining Republicans who stayed loyal to Vargas until his downfall. While lacking a cohesive ideology - in fact, local sections of the party sometimes go as far as openly oppose each other - their main rallying cry is the opposition to perceived oligarchical and corrupt nature of the Liberal government and its supposed anti-national character.§!"
BRA_social_liberal_party: "PPD"
BRA_social_liberal_party_long: "§LPartido Popular Democrático§! (Democratic People's Party)\n§LFirst appearing as a pro-democracy group during Vargas' later years, the membership of the would-be Popular Democratic Party was originally composed of catholic lawyers and intellectuals. Despite being very small, the PPD has achieved some notoriety due to the support it has received from influential members of the press and the civil society as a whole.§!"
BRA_market_liberal_party: "PRE"
BRA_market_liberal_party_long: "§LPartido Republicano Evolucionista§! (Evolutionary Republican Party)\n§LOriginating from João Pessoa's and Otávio Mangabeira's Dissidência Republicana, the Evolutionist Republicans are the representatives of the more pan-Americanist oligarchies and urban intelligentsia. Economically liberal and extremely pro-Accord, the small PRE has been an ally of the PL in the past, though Liberal dovishness and abuse of power have reduced the possibility of any further cooperation in the future.§!"
BRA_social_conservative_party: "PL/PRA"
BRA_social_conservative_party_long: "§LPartido Liberal/Partido Republicano Autonomista§! (Liberal Party/Autonomist Republican Party)\n§LInaugurated in 1943, after years of warfare and Republican authoritarianism, the new Paulista-dominated Liberal political order seemed fragile at best. President Altino Arantes knew that the survival of the regime depended upon bringing the maximum number of states into the sphere of influence of São Paulo and the PL, and that would inevitably have to include Minas Gerais. Being a traditional bastion of the PR, however, the whole Mineiro establishment was implicated in the Vargas government and unwilling to cooperate. Lacking better alternatives, the Paulistas were forced to forget the grievances of the Interstate War and turn to their former enemies, the disgraced Bernardista wing of the old PRM. The Bernardistas, in turn, preferred to keep their separate identity and founded the Autonomist Republican Party, despite the party being little more than a local satellite of the PL. While the PL-PRA alliance has successfully managed to hold together for now, some Autonomist Republicans, members of the younger cohort of the party, have shown worrying inclinations towards the PSR.§!"
BRA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PL-AR"
BRA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "§LPartido Liberal - Ação Renovadora§! (Liberal Party - Renovating Action)\n§LFor the last few decades, Brazilians have been closely watching the rise and fall of new political movements across Europe and the Americas. Integralism, Savinkovism, and even Syndicalism have all left their impression on the Brazilian public, enticing many young minds with their novel ways of political and social organization. In fact, not even Brazil's traditional parties, such as the PL and the PR, have been left unscathed from their influence. Most noticeably, the "Renovator Action", an informal Liberal caucus made up of the former "Young Wing" of the party, very active in the late 30s and early 40s, has been promoting the adoption of some of the tactics and methods copied from these modernist authoritarian regimes. The AR advocates for the political use of mass media, statist corporatism, and alignment with Germany, though striving to maintain a distinctively Brazilian and formally "social-democratic" outlook.§!"

(National Labor Party)\n§LOf all the small political parties that appeared in the wake of the 1943 elections, the National Party of Work is perhaps the most exotic one. Uniting catholic, corporatist, and socially-oriented politicians from the whole country, the PNT has attracted the most unabashedly conservative and authoritarian supporters of the Vargas regime, as well as more republican-leaning members of the Brazilian Integralist Action.§!"

### Leader Description ###

BRA_francisco_solano_carneiro_da_cunha_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 20th, 1887\nCabo de Santo Agostinho, Pernambuco, Republic of Brasil\n§W--------------§!\nScion of a wealthy usineiro family from Pernambuco, Francisco Solano Carneiro da Cunha became involved in politics from an early age. Having spent most of his adult life in Rio de Janeiro, however, first as a manager of Caixa Econômica, then as a congressman and speaker of the House, Solano da Cunha has hardly any political ties left with his home state. Perhaps it was his closeness to central power that preempted the Liberal Party to nominate him in 1947 to succeed Altino Arantes as President of Brazil, expecting him to rely on the Paulista caciques of the federal PL rather than let him have an independent power base in Pernambuco. Despite being known to have an agenda of his own, such as trying to reconcile the PL and the Evolutionists, one must be a fool to believe that Solano da Cunha can act independently in any matter of serious political importance, for every step he takes must first be approved by São Paulo's Liberal establishment."

### Ideas ###

BRA_a_patria_mutilada: "A Pátria Mutilada"
BRA_a_patria_mutilada_desc: "For centuries, the Gaúchos have resisted Castilian encroachment in the southern territories of Brazil. "Brazilians by choice", the people of Rio Grande have paid with their blood to keep the Brazilian sovereignty intact, only to see themselves pawned by a bunch of entreguista politicians and foreign generals. The day will come, however, when the gold-green flag is flown once again over the town halls of São Borja, Alegrete, and Uruguaiana, and Brazil is restored once again to its righteous borders."
BRA_decrepit_political_system: "Decrepit Political System"
BRA_decrepit_political_system_desc: "Although Brazil's current Constitution is merely 20 years old, its political system stinks of much older practices. Clientelism, nepotism and corruption are endemic, while governmental positions are monopolized by a handful of "carcomido" politicians from the PL and its allies. Access to the public sphere and patronage that comes with it are not only closed to competitors from other parties, but from inside the party as well - as attested by the intergenerational conflicts that currently plague the Liberal Party.\n\nThe sad truth is that, lacking influential godfathers and born outside of the restricted business-family web that binds the ruling elite together, some of our brightest young leaders are blocked forever from advancing in their political careers. "
BRA_discredited_army_leadership: "Discredited Army Leadership"
BRA_discredited_army_leadership_desc: "In the two decades that preceded the Brazil-Argentina War, educated Brazilians would boast about having the best Armed Forces in South America. Despite the obvious material disadvantages relative to Argentina, the Brazilian Army was said to be more disciplined, innovative and apolitical - the best emulation of the Prussian model in the continent. It all made sense at the time, for unlike its southern neighbor, which still looked up to outdated British doctrines, Brazil had the "Young Turks", a cadre of promising young officers who had spent time abroad in Germany before the Weltkrieg. This house of cards eventually came crashing down, however, as the war exposed all the corruption, unpreparedness, and incompetence of those who should be leading "the finest military force in South America". For many of our young, ours is no longer the Army of Caxias, but rather the pitiful Army of the defeatist General Klinger.\n\nWith the entire older military establishment implicated in the defeat, it remains to be seen whether our new generation of soldiers can rise up to the task of restoring the glory of Brazilian arms on the battlefield."
BRA_high_foreign_exchange_reserves: "High Foreign-Exchange Reserves"
BRA_high_foreign_exchange_reserves_desc: "Thanks to the impossibility of importing goods from Europe and North America, as well as to the high demand for Brazilian cotton, rubber, and hides in Mitteleuropan war economies, Brazil accumulated consecutive current account surpluses in the years between the end of the Brazil-Argentina and the end of the Second Weltkrieg. Now, with the war over and Bank of Brazil's coffers overflowing with foreign-exchange reserves, the balance of payments situation never looked so stable. Not everything is good news, though, as the wartime chokehold on Brazilian imports has caused much overheating in the economy, now suffering from accelerating inflation and quickly depreciating capital goods."
