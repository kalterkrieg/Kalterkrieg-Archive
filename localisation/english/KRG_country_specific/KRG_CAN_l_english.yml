CAN_idea_government_transition_desc: "When the exiles came, they all came at once. And when they came, they decided how we ran our government wasn't good enough. They tore apart our political structure, a structure they created for us, and replaced it with theirs. The senate was replaced with the house of lords, replacing our institutions with a nepotist position only people of certain birth could obtain. Upon the arrival of King George V, he usurped the Position of Governor-General and gave it to himself, whilst also increasing its Power so that he may rule as if he were still in London.\n\nMay we be thankful for Sir Mackenzie King, for without him, we would be nothing more than an extension of England rather than Canadian.

Coupled with our efforts to exploit our rich deposits of petroleum, war is truly a profitable venture, one that uplifts our small, civilian-based economy, into a matured industrialized economy. Even now, our machines crank out both appliances and weapons at maximum efficiency, not sacrificing neither quantity nor quality. Our citizens enjoy a higher standard of living, with more and more of them living in urbanized centers with higher incomes.

He spent most of the early years of his service as an Officer in the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, eventually attaining the rank of Major. He was later appointed as a General Staff Officer with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division shortly before the war broke out. Having served as a Brigade Commander for a number of years, he was eventually appointed as the General Commanding Officer of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and lead them during the landings on the Home Islands. In the years since the war, he has continued to serve Canada as a staff officer, choosing to remain rather than return to Britain. One of the youngest Generals in the Canadian armed forces, the future looks bright for General Foulkes."
CAN_rod_keller: "Rod Keller"
CAN_rod_keller_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 2 October 1900, in Tetbury, United Kingdom\n§YInformation:§W Attending the Royal Military College in Ontario in the waning years of the First Weltkrieg, he joined one of the few Canadian regiments that would not be demobilized following the war. Like almost all other Canadian flag officers, he attended a Staff College. By the time the Second Weltkrieg began and Canada once more sent her boys to fight the Empire's enemies in Europe, he had already been promoted to Major. After action in Italy and France, he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade. He would soon be promoted once more to Major General and served as General Commanding Officer of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division during the initial days of the invasion of Britain, being put in charge of one of the major landing areas. While General Keller was highly respected by his troops, after the beachheads had been secured, his drinking problem and hesitance to utilize his troops in offensive operations became clear to all. While many in the Army high command expected he would be delegated to a less important position, he was wounded when French bombers accidentally attacked his divisional headquarters, and he remained injured for the rest of the war. Without the young vitality or theoretical prowess of many of his contemporaries, the success of General Keller is by no means guaranteed in the coming years."

At age 19, he joined the Canadian Army shortly before the Second Weltkrieg's outbreak. Seeing limited action in the early years of the conflict, he eventually served in the landings in Wales and southern England. After assisting in the capture of several Totalist soldiers, he was wounded and lost one eye. He first gained national fame after capturing 93 British soldiers single handedly.  He was later assigned to perform a limited reconnaissance mission of Syndicalist elements in the area with a fellow Frenchman, who was eventually killed by Totalist militias, and Major proceeded to capture the entire town by himself, burning down the local R.E.D. office, as well as killing 4 British officers, and forcing another 5 to retreat with their troops. After an entire night of fighting and Major capturing an estimated 100 soldiers by himself, he was finally relieved and informed that all Syndicalist troops had abandoned the town. For his valorous conduct, he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and was commissioned as an officer. Throughout the remainder of the war, he would earn several promotions due to feats of bravery and excellence, achieving the rank of General by the conclusion of the war. Famously distrustful of the Germans during the war, Marshall Major is sure to oppose them with all means during this Kalterkrieg"

Serving in various battles in southern France and the invasion of Britain, he was eventually awarded the Distinguished Service Order twice over. He is the second youngest General officer in Canadian history, being promoted at the young age of 29. He shares many of the same theories as fellow General and French-Canadian Jean Allard, who is likewise a relatively young flag officer. Many military theorists speculate that Field Marshal Dextraze is just at the beginning of a very successful career, with several projecting he will eventually lead the entire Canadian Armed Forces, or perhaps all the Accord's."
CAN_bert_hoffmeister: "Bert Hoffmeister"
CAN_bert_hoffmeister_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 15 May, 1907, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Dominion of Canada\n§YInformation:§W A native Canadian, Bert Hoffmeister comes from German ancestry. He served as a sales manager during his younger years, but enlisted in the Canadian Army reserves as a young man. When Canada entered the Second Weltkrieg, Hoffmeister had already been promoted to the rank of Captain. He was quickly promoted to Major, and served as the commanding officer of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, Vancouver's Highlander reserve regiment. While still stationed in Canada, he attended courses at the Royal Military College of Canada and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel for his efforts. During the invasion of the Home Islands, Hoffmeister was given a Distinguished Service Order for his gallant service to the Empire, which he later earned a bar onto. A year later, Hoffmeister was again promoted to Brigadier, and was made commanding officer of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, seeing intense action in the frontlines against the Internationale. Another year after that, he was promoted to Major General and was transferred to the 5th Canadian Armored Division, where he would revolutionize Canadian combined arms tactics using his position as commanding officer. He was promoted one final time to General, and was given command of the 6th Canadian Division, which saw worldwide action during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. When the war ended, he was honored with several Canadian and British honors, such as being made a Companion of the Order of Bath, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and Commander of the Legion of Merit. He has since expressed some desires to retire from the military, though Ottawa has pressured him to stay at least for the time being, but this is an unsteady relationship. Small, yet growing, numbers of the Canadian citizenry are accusing him of being a German sympathizer due to his heritage, and this may be what he needs to resign"

After the First Weltkrieg broke out, he attended the Royal Military College of Canada, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Canadian Artillery, shortly before the Peace With Honor. After the humiliating defeat, Crerar attended the Army's staff college in order to further his military career and educate himself. Shortly before the Second Weltkrieg, he briefly served as Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada, resigning this post once Canada was once more at arms. He was promoted to Brigadier General, and served in a small military headquarters in Ontario, before being promoted again to Major General and commanding the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. Once the planning for landings in the Home Islands began, he was promoted once more to Lieutenant General and placed in command of the entire Canadian First Army, although it contained many troops from various Entente nations. His legendary success in recapturing England led to him eventually being promoted to a full General and Chief of the General Staff under Prime Minister King. As he is now more than sixty years old, rumors abound of General Crerar's intentions to retire, and they are not without base."

He served as a Captain in a French-speaking Canadian Infantry Regiment prior to the Second Weltkrieg, and was promoted to Major shortly after its outbreak. When his unit became converted to one of primarily English Canadians, he requested and was given a transfer to a Quebecois Infantry Reserve regiment, before being promoted and assigned to the Royal 22nd Regiment, fighting in Italy against the Socialists. He was a rare breed in the Army's upper echelons, not just due to his Quebecois roots, but also being one of a few Canadian flag officers that never served during the First Weltkrieg. His lack of exposure to the wars failed tactics led to him developing his own combined arms theories, which he employed on the battlefields of Europe, winning him many military honors and strategic positions. With many of her greatest military minds aging or leaving for Britain, General Allard is a sure member of the Canadian General Staff for this new kind of warfare."

CAN_MACKENZIE_KING_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 17th, 1874\nBerlin, Ontario, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nKing is a man of irony and contradictions. Someone who shouldn't be yet is. A man that leads a country on a collision course with Germany yet is born in a town named Berlin. The grandson of the rebel leader who fought against the British Empire yet commands the most powerful country in the Entente. A man of no charisma and zero affection yet is Canada's longest-serving Prime Minister with a record of achievements.\n\nKing proved himself in his second tenure when he faced the challenge of leading the country through the Second Weltkrieg. Under King, Canada became a modern industrial nation, making immense sacrifices to the war effort that taxed the country's resources to the limit in its fight against the Third Internationale. Canadians commanded an Entente whose influence even feared Germany, who feared the resurgence of the faction. Throughout all of this, national unity was King's most important goal, his handling of conscription prevented a national divide. King had a nation entirely dedicated to defeating the enemy once and for all.\n\nWith the victory unshackling Canada from the colonial era, the post-war prospects look promising as the economy booms, and Canada reasserts its independence ready to lead the free. All of which is carefully curated by a cabinet of talented men and his carefully moulded Liberal Party. While King's political acuity and faultless judgement have made him a strangely potent figure, the Germans' aggressive posturing against the Entente and their bomb will test the ageing King whose stamina is drained. Perhaps it's time for a new ambitious face for this Canada. A Liberal face, of course."

CAN_MJ_COLDWELL_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 2nd, 1888\nSeaton, England, United Kingdom\n§W--------------§!\nDespite being a noted Leftist in Canadian politics for many years and a former English immigrant, Prime Minister Coldwell did not return to Britain to participate in the Revolution of 1925. In fact, Coldwell's staunch criticism of the totalitarian government of the Union of Britain allowed him to avoid becoming a victim of the fervent anti-socialist sentiment of the Interwar Period. The Prime Minister's true loyalties remain with Canada and the plight of her people. As one of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation's founding members and leader, Coldwell has frequently toed the line between political pragmatism and the ideals of a democratic socialist utopia to the contempt and derision of Tories and traditional Leftists alike.\n\nAs a man of the working class, few would ever guess that Coldwell himself descended from a wealthy and conservative family. Yet, this former schoolteacher proved to be one of the  great uniters for the labour movement in Western Canada. Coldwell helped bring together the coalition of farmers, trade unionists, and progressive intellectuals that would form the heart of the CCF.\n\nA strong supporter of the welfare state and egalitarianism, Coldwell and the CCF found themselves increasingly sidelined in Canadian politics as the Liberals implemented an increasing number of social welfare policies. Although victorious in the election, many are already speculating that the Coldwell Government will be a short-lived one. The question remains as to whether the Prime Minister will stick to the policy of moderatism that has served him so well before or will he return the CCF to the more radical past of the Regina Manifesto."


CAN_TOMMY_DOUGLAS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 20th, 1904\nCameron, Scotland, United Kingdom\n§W--------------§!\nBefore immigrating to Canada as a young boy, Douglas injured his right knee and developed Osteomyelitis. After arriving in Winnipeg, his parents were told that Douglas' knee would require amputation. Fortunately, a surgeon took interest and agreed to treat him for free in exchange for allowing students to observe the operation. Douglas's early experience would drive his passion for social betterment for all.  After this profound experience, he became involved with the Social Gospel Movement which combined Christian principles with social justice in the pursuit of salvation.\n\nDouglas' prominence as a Baptist minister and as a left wing activist during the Depression would eventually lead him to being elected as an MP and as Premier of Saskatechwan for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.  Douglas' bold public investment programs and democratic socialist principles would lead to the pioneering of the Canadian welfare system and greater advances in workers' and individual rights.  Despite the war and unease with many Exiles, Douglas would denounce the Totalists and strongly supported conscription. By the end of his second term, Douglas had achieved the introduction of universal healthcare in Saskatchewan. This was not enough for Douglas, more had to be done on a national level. The disappointing failure of the federal CCF left it reeling and without a leader. Douglas would be chosen as the new leader of the CCF and negotiated the merger between the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress, resulting in the formation of the New Democratic Party.\n\nAlthough this upstart leftist party was considered doomed to failure by many, Douglas' raving speeches and the increasing popularity of the policies he successfully implemented in Saskatchewan surprised many. With this newfound surge in popularity, Douglas' NDP rocked the 1953 election and secured his position as Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Douglas promises to expand the welfare state to the national level, most notable is his promise to create a national single-payer healthcare system in the new mixed economy. Many of Canada's more traditionalist elements despise him and his NDP, for a variety of reasons. The growing number of Detentists within the NDP has been a concern to many as the Kalterkrieg progresses. Stranger still, there is a small radical minority in the party who feel Germany is a threat to progressivism and calls for its eradication. Douglas has never spoken publicly about his views on the Kalterkrieg. Many can only hope that he seeks to strengthen Canada's position on the global stage."

CAN_LOUIS_ST_LAURENT_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 1st, 1882\nCompton, Quebec, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nFor a statesman reluctant to enter national politics, Prime Minister St. Laurent has proven himself to be a productive and indispensable member of the Liberal Party during his tenure in Ottawa. A young man during the time of Sir Wilfred Laurier, St. Laurent chose to pursue a career in law rather than politics and became a lawyer. St. Laurent dutifully served as the Minister of Justice in the wartime cabinet of Prime Minister King after the untimely death of his predecessor Ernest Lapointe in 1941. Becoming one of King's most trusted advisors on Quebec and French-Canadian tensions. It would be thanks in large part to the efforts of St. Laurent that the Liberal Government was able to survive the Conscription Crisis of 1936. Thus, making St. Laurent King's natural choice as successor.\n\nControversially, St. Laurent was also responsible for the creation of the St. Laurent Committee. The Committee would be the Liberal Government's answer to the calls for sweeping powers to be granted to the RCMP and act as Canada's shield against the spread of syndicalism and internal dissent. With its members operating solely within the purview of the War Measures Act and St. Laurent himself. Much of the Committee's operations and methodology remain classified to the Canadian public to this day.\n\nFor now, the Canadian public appears to be willing to overlook these past wartime measures as they throw their support behind the Liberals and the grandfatherly "Uncle Louis". The Liberals will need to be mindful of where they tread, the postwar euphoria will not last forever and voters are often fickle things. In these uncertain times of changing cultures and beliefs, it will be up to St. Laurent to lead this nation through the changing zeitgeist of the new decade."

CAN_JOHN_DIEFENBAKER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 18th, 1895\nNeustadt, Ontario, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nPrime Minister Diefenbaker finds himself in a unique position in Canadian history. A Prime Minister of German descent in a time where anti-German sentiment in the country almost rivals that of the First Weltkrieg. Make no mistake though, he is no mere German puppet. Diefenbaker has had the aspirations to hold the Office of Prime Minister since childhood during the days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.\n\nAs his forceful public speeches make clear, he is an ardent civic nationalist and firm supporter of the British Commonwealth at heart. Appalled by the authoritarian measures being advocated by the Exile-dominated Conservative Party at the time, Diefenbaker threw his lot in with Prime Minister King and the Liberal Party. Although many speculated that this union was unlikely to last. With the new media on his side and against all odds, Diefenbaker's national policies and unique sense of Canadianism defeated King's handpicked successor, the controversial Louis St. Laurent, and won him the leadership position of the Liberals after King's retirement. The defeat of the St. Laurent faction reflected renewed calls for the downsizing of the postwar federal government and the dismantling of the large industrial complex that developed in the government during the Reclamation of the Home Isles. That being said, Diefenbaker has promised to increase support for working families and returning veterans with better pensions and a more robust social safety net.\n\nDuring his time as a small town lawyer in rural Saskatchewan, Diefenbaker has spent a great amount of effort championing the cause of civil libertarianism. With his election, the Canadian Civil Rights Movement has seen an incredible revitalization in momentum and morale. With growing calls to expand civil rights and equal opportunities for all Canadians, Diefenbaker's Government will be on the forefront of the debate on the drafting of a national Bill of Rights.\n\nNow in this strange and uncertain age, it rests upon this German-Canadian to lead the international struggle against German authoritarianism and to defend the integral rights and freedoms of the Canadian people. With a resurgent German Empire in Europe and old nationalist divisions revealing themselves in Canada, Diefenbaker's staunch traditionalism will be tested. Only time will tell if Diefenbaker's vision of "One Canada" for all will be able to withstand the trials both at home and abroad."

CAN_LOUIS_ST_LAURENT_1953_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 1st, 1882\nCompton, Quebec, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nFor a statesman reluctant to enter national politics, Prime Minister St. Laurent has proven himself to be a productive and indispensable member of the Liberal Party during his tenure in Ottawa.

St. Laurent dutifully served as the Minister of Justice in the wartime cabinet of Prime Minister King after the untimely death of his predecessor Ernest Lapointe in 1941.

Prior to this, it was in large part thanks to the efforts of St. Laurent that the Liberal Government was able to survive the Conscription Crisis of 1936. Thus, making St. Laurent King's natural choice as successor.\n\nNow nearing the twelfth consecutive year of his "temporary" political career in Ottawa. The strain from the daily runnings of the state are evidently beginning to take their toll on the elderly St. Laurent. The once affable "Uncle Louis" no longer displays the same dedication and enthusiasm he once did in cabinet meetings and parliamentary debate. Now, St. Laurent appears weary, disinterested, and prone to outbursts of anger. Many senior members in the cabinet suspect St. Laurent has begun developing the symptoms of depression. Fortunately for the Liberals, St. Laurent's ministers remain loyal and competent in their duties.\n\nAlthough not yet apparent, the public perception of Liberals has begun suffering as a consequence of the aging leadership and general arrogance of some principal figures. With St. Laurent himself far more interested in retiring and spending time with his grandchildren than spending time in the House of Commons, the Liberals will need to seriously reassess their place in Canadian politics as society shifts. Should they fail, it will likely mark the end of Liberal dominance in parliament for years to come."

CAN_LESTER_PEARSON_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 23rd, 1897\nNewtonbrook, Ontario, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nServing in the First Weltkrieg in the Canadian Army's Medical Corps as well as the Royal Flying Corps, Prime Minister Pearson was humbled and haunted by the inhumanity and horrors of the Great War. A modest man by virtue, Pearson entered politics as a member of the Department of External Affairs following the British Revolution. After former Prime Minister King's victory in the 1944 election, he reshuffled some of his cabinet positions and appointed Pearson as the Secretary of State for External Affairs. Pearson dealt with many dignitaries and Heads of State in this role, from Kings to Kaisers and everything in between. After King's retirement, Pearson continued being one of the prominent faces of Canada internationally as one of Canada's foremost diplomats while advocating strongly for the Accord but also encouraging stronger and cooperative ties with non-aligned countries.\n\nWith the defeat of the Liberals in the previous election, the party decided it needed a new face and Pearson was deemed the best option. Although by no means a surprise victory, the election was far from guaranteed for the Liberals and many attest their victory solely to Prime Minister Pearson's efforts. With the promise of social programs and a more distinct Canadian identity, his term will mark a modern Canada ready for anything or so it is hoped. A man strongly committed to peace and the peaceful resolution to conflicts, Pearson while not a Detentist, prefers diplomatic solutions to open belligerency. He will leverage his skills as a diplomat to increase Canadian prestige and power internationally and to stymie his foes. However, Pearson is equally ready to defend the interests of the Accord and nations threatened by foreign aggressors should they not heed to the calls of diplomacy. The rapid expansion and modernization of the Canadian Nuclear Weapons Program under Pearson will serve as the epitomization of the old adage: "Si vis pacem, para bellum, if you want peace, prepare for war".\n\nWith Pearson's ascension to the Office of Prime Minister, Canadian influence in global affairs has seen a stark increase with fresh funding being made available to the diplomatic corps and the armed forces. Pearson's term will likely see closer ties being formed with our allies in the Accord along with greater outreach efforts being made towards the non-aligned nations of the world. The world watches with great curiosity, as this new leader of the free world boldly shapes the new foreign policy of a modern Canada."

CAN_GEORGE_DREW_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 7th, 1894\nGuelph, Ontario, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nGeorge A. Drew has been a man of many fascinating professions: lawyer, journalist, youngest mayor in Canada, war hero, Premier of Ontario, and now the Prime Minister of Canada. There are few men out there that are as loved or as hated as Prime Minister Drew. Lauded for his stalwart anti-syndicalism by his supporters and accused of being a rabid anti-Quebec puppet of the British Exiles by his detractors. Regardless of whether you love him or hate him, there is no doubt that he is a man that holds his convictions above all and will defend them at any cost.\n\nThroughout his life, Drew at his core has been a steadfast loyalist to the British Crown. Even his forefathers were British Loyalists that fled the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution and would eventually settle in Guelph, itself a town of a British immigrants in what would become the Colony of Upper Canada. With his grandfather having served in the local militia and Prime Minister John A. MacDonald's cabinet during Confederation, Drew was acquainted with the rule of law, conservatism, and imperialism at a young age. Drew himself served with distinction as an artillery officer during the First Weltkrieg, losing the function of his left arm in service to the Empire. Despite the valiant efforts of men like Drew, Britain's humiliating defeat was only exacerbated by the Revolution of 1925. After his entry into politics, Drew would become one of the strongest advocates for the British Exiles with relentless calls for the toppling of the syndicalist menace across the Atlantic.\n\nWith the end of the Second Weltkrieg and the Reclamation of the Home Isles complete, it will be up to this former soldier to win the peace. Even though victorious in this election, the Conservative Party is nearing disaster. With funds and support drying up with the departure of the Exiles and divisions widening between the traditional "Blue Tories" and communitarian "Red Tories", the Conservative Party seems poised to tear itself apart. In these changing times, personal inflexibility and vehement British nationalism may prove more problematic than beneficial for the new Prime Minister."

CAN_JOHN_DIEFENBAKER_1953_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 18th, 1895\nNeustadt, Ontario, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nThe aftermath of the Liberal Party purge left a very bad taste in the mouths of many Canadians and none more so than Diefenbaker's base in Western Canada and the new young fledgling middle class of Canadians. In the eyes of the Diefenbaker faction, this was nothing more than a thinly veiled coup. Outraged by the arrogance of "Uncle Louis" St. Laurent and the Liberal establishment, many Liberals began breaking away from the party. A majority of these breakaways would end up joining Diefenbaker's new Progressive Conservative Party to the chagrin of the Liberals. Now with his base of power secured, he has yet again become Prime Minister of Canada, much to the ire of the Liberal Party.\n\nMuch of Diefenbaker's good fortune coincided with the collapse of the old Conservative Party who, too tied up with the oldstock politics and glory of British imperialism, began to split as its modernist "Red Tory" faction took heed in leaving the party in favour of Diefenbaker's more moderate and modern communitarianism idyllic form of Red Toryism. Promising a government fair to the people and respectful of the will of Parliament, a new government policy not based on dogmatic principles of the past, but based on cosmopolitan and increasingly diverse needs of the changing Canadian population. With the promise of lower taxes along with greater state support for citizens and the country at large, defiant to the interests of big business and bureaucrats. As charismatic and raving as before and without the shackles of party elites, Diefenbaker's blunt and honest message ensured him the biggest election victory to date.\n\nWith much to prove and a new loyal following, Diefenbaker's vision of "One Canada" commitment to political freedoms, civil liberties, and the "common good" of all Canadians will test Canada's ability and willingness to bring the ideological battle to Germany and the emerging struggles for self-determination across the world. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's often chaotic style of leadership will test the effectiveness of his government in turning campaign promises to law for Canadians already distrustful of government bureaucracy and Bay Street Elites. With a new generation of young Canadians gaining increasing prominence in Canada's postwar society. Diefenbaker's Conservative government will need to be mindful of their promises for a modern Canada, the new Canadian generation will not be quick to forget broken promises."

CAN_DOUGLAS_JUNG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 24th, 1924\nVictoria, British Columbia, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nThe plight of Chinese Canadians coming to Canada has been a long and often heartbreaking tale, something Prime Minister Douglas Jung himself is unlikely to forget. Chinese immigration to Canada predates the very idea of a united "Canada". Many Chinese immigrants came to North America in search of opportunity and to escape the poverty and turmoil afflicting their homeland. Their numbers spiked as immigrants flocked to the Pacific Northwest towards the close of the California Gold Rush. In fact, it was the labour of these immigrants that secured the entry of British Columbia into Confederation. Countless Chinese labourers were exploited and would be mutilated or killed to fulfill Prime Minister MacDonald's promise of a new railway to unite the nation. These efforts would be rewarded with increasingly harsh and restrictive head taxes and Immigration Acts. Alas, even Laurier's Last Best West would be for Europeans and Europeans only. Over the years, Chinese-Canadians would continue to be victims of racial discrimination. The stories of numerous immigrants during the Exclusion Era stand as one of the darkest periods in Canadian history.\n\nPrime Minister Jung would not be discouraged by the shackles that society placed on him and his people. He would make it his life goal to prove that the notions held about Chinese-Canadians were wrong and that these loyal sons of Canada could be just as capable as anyone else regardless of race or ethnicity. Jung immediately enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces at the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg. Despite the reluctance of the government to utilize Chinese-Canadian forces, the Military High Command overrode them in the affair and accepted Jung into active service. The Secret Intelligence Service recruited dozens of Chinese-Canadians for intelligence-gathering operations in Southeast Asia based in the former colonial holding of Hong Kong. These intelligence reports would prove invaluable for both the military and the Department of External Affairs. Jung managed to evade detainment during both the German and Japanese Occupations of the Legation Cities until he was finally withdrawn after the Guangzhou Government's reincorporation of Hong Kong. The legacy of Chinese-Canadian SIS operatives would soon shift public views and gain the respect of many.\n\nAfter being released from active service, Jung would obtain a law degree and enter Canadian politics as a member of Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative Party. In Vancouver, Jung was elected as the first Asian MP to be sent to the House of Commons. Jung rose through the ranks and became leader of the large Young Conservative Wing of the party along with serving a term as a representative at the Congress of Nations. As a longtime compromise figure between Diefenbaker and dissenters within his cabinet, Jung was able to win the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives. His personal dedication and charm won him overwhelming support from the new generation of young adults. Now as Prime Minister, Jung seeks to amend Canada's past wrongs at home and to expand the ideological battlegrounds of the Kalterkrieg. As a descendent from Southern China himself and with years of valuable experience behind him, the former colonial world is shaping up to Jung's main diplomatic aim. It is up to the fresh-faced Jung to lead the nation through the turn of the decade."

CAN_WAC_BENNET_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 68th, 1900\nHastings, New Brunswick, Dominion of Canada\n§W--------------§!\nThe election of Prime Minister William Andrew Cecil Bennett came as a surprise to many in the traditional political establishment of Canada. It would appear distrust of the Liberal Party and CCF along with doubt over the capabilities of Diefenbaker's new Progressive Conservatives was more predominant than previously estimated by political experts. Coupled with the effectiveness of the Unionist Party's intense criticism of their opponents as threats to Canadian heritage at best and syndicalist sympathizers at worst proved disastrous for the mainstream political parties.  Nevertheless, Bennett's victory in the 1953 election has proven the viability of right-wing populism in Canadian politics.\n\nThe Conservative Party Schism and its resulting fracturing was the catalyst that led to the formation of the Unionist Party of Canada. The Unionists are predominantly comprised of hardcore Conservatives, the Western Social Credit Movement, and the remnants of the British Exiles in Canada. Elected on the promises of defending Canadian values and rooting out radical elements within Canadian society, their ascension to power has likely marked the beginning of a sharp rightward shift in Canadian politics and foreign policy. Although stylizing themselves as defenders of the Canadian way of life, concerns exist within the Canadian intelligentsia that these defenders will overwhelmingly focus their efforts on pursuing the ghosts of syndicalism. The greatest concern is that Bennett and his Unionists will attempt to court the Kaiser in their crusade during the Kalterkrieg.\n\nPrime Minister Bennett himself comes from a fairly humble background. Despite the financially disadvantaged position of his family during adolescence, Bennett's personal ambition remained unwavering. Dissatisfied with the life of a farmer, Bennett successfully bought and managed a hardware store in Kelowna. Eventually, Bennett was able to start his own hardware store chain before entering politics. Originally a member of the Conservative Party of British Columbia, Bennett would leave the party after the collapse of the federal Conservative Party to take up the reins of the Unionist Party. As the exemplar of the hardworking Christian Canadian man, Bennett has a clear vision for his ideal society. The question remains as to who exactly can be included in Bennett's Canada."

CAN_protection_through_annihilation_desc: "The best way to protect yourself from an enemy is to eliminate it, and this philosophy applies itself perfectly to military theory. By inflicting maximum devastation upon enemy forces through armour and artillery strikes, we can be sure that they can no longer pose a threat to us, allowing our infantry to advance with minimal casualties."
CAN_command_and_staff_college_expansion: "Command College Expansion"
CAN_command_and_staff_college_expansion_desc: "Command colleges are critical institutions to our officer class. They provide them with the information they need to command their units in various circumstances effectively and in how to use specific equipment to their greatest extent. As such, with our increased number of commissions being handed out, it becomes imperative that we expand the scopes of our current colleges to accommodate the new influx of potential officers and update the information being taught to them."
CAN_anti_panzer_capabilities: "Anti-Panzer Capabilities"
CAN_anti_panzer_capabilities_desc: "With our focus being refocused on Germany, it stands to reason that we shall design our military strategy to counter the German military doctrine. To this end, the panzer stands as a critical point of contention as its unique ability to be reliable, mobile, and host significant firepower poses a unique challenge to our armed forces. However, nothing is perfect, the panzers being no exception, and as such, our forces will be issued and trained to use new anti-tank equipment designed to exploit weaknesses in the panzers' armor."
CAN_rocket_powered_tactics: "Rocket Powered Tactics"
CAN_rocket_powered_tactics_desc: "The field of rocketry is quickly advancing, opening up new and exciting possibilities for our military. In order to fully realize the potential of these great new advancements, we should fund additional research into how rocketry can be used to enhance our military tactics."
CAN_armoured_regiment_refits: "Armoured Regiment Refits"
CAN_armoured_regiment_refits_desc: "By retrofitting the in-service tanks to meet new technological standards, we can prolong the service life of our equipment by several years, saving us valuable resources without compromising operational effectiveness."
CAN_tank_durability_and_armour_company: "Tank Durability and Armour Company"
CAN_tank_durability_and_armour_company_desc: "A tank is only as useful as it is reliable, and though under normal circumstances, our tanks perform within our standards, we can't always expect to operate within such temperate conditions. As such, the durability of our tanks must be improved to withstand the stresses of more extreme environments."
CAN_heavy_infantry_mechanization: "Heavy Infantry Mechanization"
CAN_heavy_infantry_mechanization_desc: "The creation of a heavy infantry unit between traditional infantry and armor units would allow for a formation that holds the mobility of infantry with the firepower of armor. This heavy infantry would be equipped with various armored cars, half-trucks, and mechanized transports to support their mission and reach their goals, becoming a new and integral part of our land forces."
CAN_armoured_breakthrough: "Armoured Breakthrough"
CAN_armoured_breakthrough_desc: "The primary role of armor on the battlefield will be to punch holes within enemy formations to allow our infantry and mechanized infantry to mop up the remaining forces. This strategy worked during the Second Weltkrieg, and by analyzing its strengths and weaknesses, we can further refine its usage on the battlefield to achieve superior results."
CAN_reconnaissance_and_exploitation: "Reconnaissance and Exploitation"
CAN_reconnaissance_and_exploitation_desc: "As a component of our military strategy, reconnaissance cannot be understated in its importance. Scouting out the enemy allows us to gauge their strengths and weaknesses, allowing our forces to exploit this information to their advantage, and win the day's battle, while also saving valuable lives."
CAN_integrated_armoured_bridages: "Integrated Armoured Brigades"
CAN_integrated_armoured_bridages_desc: "Allowing armored brigades to interact with other brigades across numerous divisions more effectively will allow for a more flexible military environment for tanks to operate without being held up in confusion regarding who's in command or what orders they are to follow."
CAN_hussars_of_tomorrow: "Hussars of Tomorrow"
CAN_hussars_of_tomorrow_desc: "Like the Hussars of centuries past, the tank will occupy a similar role to the cavalry of that era, softening up the enemy lines to allow the infantry to beat them back, pursuing them through their retreat, all the while defining a legacy of their own through their Canadian heritage. Yet, unlike the Hussars, Canadian armor is far more deadly, protective, and bombastic in achieving its results, leading to a reputation of fear for anyone who should stand in their way and comfort for those who stand by them."
CAN_modern_warfare: "Modern Warfare"
CAN_modern_warfare_desc: "After much time and investment, the Canadian Armed Forces are now fully equipped for the challenges of modern warfare. While there are certainly still challenges ahead and maintenance to be done to adapt the Armed Forces to the future, we can rest on our laurels knowing that the groundwork we've laid today will help us achieve those challenges that much easier. Although, it is probably best that we don't get too overconfident, lest we fall victim to hubris, much like how Icarus flew too close to the sun."

CAN_a_new_era_desc: "Never again shall the people of our nation suffer under the hardships of another Great Depression. The massive economic and social changes brought by the Second Weltkrieg has seen Canada transform herself from an agricultural backwater to a global industrial power. With further advances in technology and productivity, a new era is dawning on Canada, an Era of Growth and Prosperity."

CAN_sea_to_sea: "From Sea to Sea"
CAN_sea_to_sea_desc: "Canada's lengthy coastlines are both a blessing and a curse. Despite the plentiful access provided to the sea for trade, the Royal Canadian Navy is stretched between foreign stations and policing the home territories. Domestic shipbuilding capacity must be expanded if Canada is to be able to both defend her own waters and project power abroad, a mari usque ad mare, from sea to sea."

CAN_transcanada_highway: "The Trans-Canada Highway"
CAN_transcanada_highway_desc: "Over half a century ago, the infant Canadian nation was united from coast to coast by the Canadian Pacific Railway. With Canada's growing populations and North American defense policy, a new need arisen for stronger transport connections to link the nation. An ambitious plan has been proposed for the constuction of the modern successor to the Canadian Pacific Railway, a national Trans-Canada Highway."

CAN_new_suburbia: "Suburbia"
CAN_new_suburbia_desc: "With the postwar economy booming and soldiers re-entering civilian life, more and more Canadians are seeking to find their own slices of paradise away from the dense cities in the idyllic countryside. Supporting the counstruction of these suburbs along with adjacent businesses such as shopping centres and restaurants could be a great benefit to the economy."

CAN_provincial_superhighways: "Provincial Super Highways"
CAN_provincial_superhighways_desc: "Southern Ontario has experienced considerable growth and development in recent years. This growth and development is beginning to outpace existing transport links. With the boom in car ownership, a new network of highways has been proposed to deal with Ontario's transportation woes."

CAN_auto_boom: "The Auto Boom"
CAN_auto_boom_desc: "Advances in technology and production line stardardization have made the automobile more affordable than ever before. As a consequence, vehicle ownership is rapidly growing as the car is quickly becoming the symbol of the new affluent middle class."

CAN_car_cities: "Car Cities"
CAN_car_cities_desc: "As suburbs are becoming increasingly commomplace, the car is quickly becoming the dominant mode of transportation for Canadians. From Vancouver to Halifax, many metropolitan centres will have to adjust to the flow of workers entering and leaving. New road infrastructure will be required or else congestion will bring Canada's cities to a grinding halt."

CAN_windsor_quebec: "The Windsor-Quebec Corridor"
CAN_windsor_quebec_desc: "The densely populated corridor between Quebec City and the city of Windsor is undergoing unprecedented economic and population growth. The only way we can keep up is by building new large "express freeways" that will change the landscape of transport forever."

CAN_era_of_oil: "Era of Oil"
CAN_era_of_oil_desc: "Black Gold. Oil. In the 20th Century, it has become the lifeblood of any global power. It feeds our warships, heats our homes, and runs the machinery in our factories. Canada holds sizeable reserves of this valuable black liquid, stored deep within the earth, just waiting to be exploited."

CAN_era_of_hydro: "Era of Hydro"
CAN_era_of_hydro_desc: "A wise man should make the most out of what is freely offered in plenty. Nature itself offers much to Canada. Hydroelectricity is presenting itself as one of the most easily accessible and economic methods to meet the growing electric demands of Canadians. It would be foolish not to make the most out of Canada's numerous rivers."

CAN_transcanada_pipeline: "The Trans-Canada Pipeline"
CAN_transcanada_pipeline_desc: "Geography remains an obstacle for the Canadian oil and gas sector with most reserves being relatively isolated in Prairies. C.D. Howe has proposed the construction of a new pipeline to link the fuel reserves in the west to the industrial heart of eastern Canada. When completed, the Trans-Canada pipeline will be the largest of its kind in the world."

CAN_albertan_boom: "Albertan Boom"
CAN_albertan_boom_desc: "Since the discovery of major oil reserves in Ludec in 1947, the province of Alberta has seen an economic revitalization from the transition from agriculture to oil production. The rival cities of Edmonton and Calgary have seen a dramatic upsurge in population as thousands flood into the province seeking to make their fortunes. For now, the prosperity in Alberta seems unlikely to end any time soon."

CAN_gateway_to_west: "Gateway to The West"
CAN_gateway_to_west_desc: "The isolation between Western Canada and the industrial and political core in Eastern Canada has been a cause of tension for years in Canadian history. Further developing the links between East and West would be a good start in improving national unity."

CAN_modernize_welland_desc: "The Welland Canal is a historic and important shipping link between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. For years the canal has served as a crucial connection for trade in the Great Lakes region. The canal requires extensive modernization if it is to handle the new large lake freighters of the modern era."

CAN_begin_seaway: "Begin the Seaway"
CAN_begin_seaway_desc: "In the Age of Discovery, the Saint Lawrence River was hoped to be an easily accessible route to the heart of the North American continent. Unfortunately, any passage beyond Montreal has been blocked by the Lachine Rapids and other obstacles. The growing usage of canals in bypassing these obstacles has helped inspire one of the largest civil engineering projects in the world to connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic. An impressive proposed system of locks, canals, and channels dubbed the 'Saint Lawrence Seaway'"

The path ahead, we may be sure, is not to be without challenge - despite it all, we are resolved to push on! Nothing can stop us now, with the prime ministership secured, and Canada will be ready for the change we will bring - or we will make it ready."
CAN_foundations_for_peace: "The Foundations for Peace"
CAN_foundations_for_peace_desc: "Peace in the world will bring peace at home; by making it quite clear to our global rivals and friends alike that Canada has entered a new era of foreign policy, one in which words and not weapons will be our primary tools, our internal affairs can be set in order as well."
CAN_expand_the_civil_service: "Expand the Civil Service"
CAN_expand_the_civil_service_desc: "In order to effect change, we will need a new expansion of functionaries across the country. Every province, every county, every city - we would be betraying those who elected us were any to be neglected. Of course, no official who does not truly have the best interests of the people at heart may be allowed to take a position under our government; nonetheless, we may need to reinforce our structure with a few less dedicated bureaucrats if we are to hold a strong and stable Canada."
CAN_the_leash_on_the_military: "The Leash on the Military"
CAN_the_leash_on_the_military_desc: "Exorbitant funding requests, senseless warmongering, and thousands of our young men sent to die, often oceans away - we've just about had it with the military's nonsense! Our government cannot be allowed to find itself hamstrung by its officers, no matter what they might think about our measures. And what of the commentators who feel this is degrading to Canadian national pride? Our pride will be one that has no need to be found in the deaths of others."
CAN_leading_our_allies: "Leading our Allies"
CAN_leading_our_allies_desc: "A pacifist foreign policy need not mean a toothless one. Canada will find strength in her allies, and her allies strength in her; Canadian influence will blossom in those nations willing to receive her with open arms. Trade, aid, and the Canadian way will spread a light across the world."
CAN_canadian_industrial_revolution: "The Canadian Industrial Revolution"
CAN_canadian_industrial_revolution_desc: "To the mines! The Canadian industrial worker, as one of the most valuable components in society, should be championed. And indeed, our country's infrastructure could use some development - everywhere there is the possibility for industrialization on a truly grand scale, across the whole of the nation. As our economy shifts towards this goal, each element of society will ultimately have something to contribute."
CAN_new_social_planning: "New Social Planning"
CAN_new_social_planning_desc: "Across Canada, the NDP will create a reinvented model for society. The disparate groups that have long made up the country will be tied together firmly by common interest, a common interest our government will enthusiastically move to serve. Through wide-ranging policies that help all Canadians, the people are going to enjoy unprecedented security and stability in all aspects of their lives. At first, of course, we may meet some resistance - but we are determined to not back down! Our goals will be achieved, and a social-democratic Canadian dream realized."
CAN_the_problems_of_the_subnormal_family: "The Problems of the Subnormal Family"
CAN_the_problems_of_the_subnormal_family_desc: "Canada is a beautiful nation. A nation with diversity, resplendent projects that are emblematic of our national identity, and a grand presence upon the international stage. And yet some parts of our society simply do not rise to meet the Canadian dream. How can this be permitted? And how can we fail to take moral responsibility for their lack of proper characteristics, as befitting a Canadian citizen? Beginning today, our government must start to create a Canada growing ever closer to perfection, utilizing an old idea finding new popularity - that of eugenics. Some, of course, the weak-willed traitors who wish our every effort to fail, will disapprove of such a notion. But what have we ever cared for their opinions?"
CAN_developing_the_rural_base: "Developing the Rural Base"
CAN_developing_the_rural_base_desc: "To build up cities at the countryside's expense would be foolish indeed. The very heart of Canada lies in her natural beauty, and our crop fields make an important economic contribution. By supporting both small and big farmers, our agriculture can be revitalized and perhaps grown to new heights."
CAN_south_saskatchewan_river_project: "The South Saskatchewan River Project"
CAN_south_saskatchewan_river_project_desc: "The South Saskatchewan River is important to many communities in Saskatchewan, and commissioning a series of dams in this region would reinforce our government as one that cares about the common man. Investing in this project would doubtless strengthen the province's economy, too, leading to a net gain for our administration. Saskatchewan will be the firm midpoint of Canadian infrastructure, where the eastern and western identities converge."
CAN_subsidies_for_farmers_and_fishers: "Subsidies for Farmers and Fishers"
CAN_subsidies_for_farmers_and_fishers_desc: "An integral part of Canada, our county's farmers and fishermen could doubtless do with some economic uplift. Among the most productive members of society, it must be shown that we have not neglected them amongst our other programs, which mostly target urban centers. In the provinces with the closest ties to these groups, our government will work to develop their light industry, too. All of Canadian society will be brought together into a new unity from these policies, and none will feel neglected."
CAN_an_understanding_with_private_business: "An Understanding With Private Business"
CAN_an_understanding_with_private_business_desc: "Despite our ultimate vision and goals for the place of private business, they currently occupy a significant place in the country - and certainly in its economy. Whatever qualms we may have about them, it is surely necessary to negotiate in order to realize our long-term goals. An understanding with them will be reached, such that we will be able to sustain faster construction for longer and improve the workings of our economy."
CAN_increasing_the_right_to_education: "Increasing the Right To Education"
CAN_increasing_the_right_to_education_desc: "All Canadian citizens deserve a full education. Too many, especially in far-flung provinces to the west and north, still lack it, and we must take measures to correct this. A program on the national level will be initiated, to bring knowledge into every home. This will fuel support amongst our population, for who can disapprove of such a noble idea? A new generation of future thinkers will be raised securely, no matter their economic status."
CAN_national_resources_board: "National Resources Board"
CAN_national_resources_board_desc: "We have a Country To Build! Across all sectors, we will invest and develop Canada's most important resources. The lucrative extraction of oil, in particular, should be expanded. A government-wide program to streamline approval for such acts will be implemented, and soon our country will be humming with modern improvements."
CAN_new_crown_corporations: "Expand Crown Corporations"
CAN_new_crown_corporations_desc: "The era of 'province building' is well and truly upon us. Our government, at both the federal and provincial level, will approve the construction of new Crown corporations to address specific projects across the country. Through this manner of top-down decentralization, which we are assured is by no means an oxymoron, different enterprises can be embarked upon without the need for each minute detail to go through federal approval."
CAN_female_employees_equal_pay_act: "Female Employees Equal Pay Act"
CAN_female_employees_equal_pay_act_desc: "More than half of our country's population must labor under unfair conditions, receiving pay significantly less than their coworkers even when the quality of their work is often higher. This has to be eliminated at once with the Female Employees Equal Pay Act (FEEPA). No workplace can be permitted to engage in such practices any longer, under our government's watchful eye."
CAN_expand_hospital_insurance_and_diagnostic_services: "Expand the Hospital and Diagnostic Services Act"
CAN_expand_hospital_insurance_and_diagnostic_services_desc: "The current health and insurance programs in place, both federally and provincially, may not be quite sufficient. Cost concerns have been raised by some, and so we must dedicate more funding to this area. No one should ever go without care because of a bureaucratic discrepancy in the money available!"
CAN_expanding_other_social_programs: "Expanding Other Social Programs"
CAN_expanding_other_social_programs_desc: "Healthcare is far from the only important or relevant program that needs expansion. Every sector that might conceivably encounter difficulty ought to be aided, so that those who it affects may be fully secure. Admittedly, this will place some strain on the government's budget, but the people must be taken care of by our administration, no matter what."
CAN_a_more_progressive_tax_code: "A More Progressive Tax Code"
CAN_a_more_progressive_tax_code_desc: "The current tax system in Canada is mired in bureaucratic excesses. Some are taxed three times as much as others while having identical situations, and loopholes abound. We need reform, and soon, in order to correct the system's many flaws and failings. Of course, the government still has to earn a steady revenue from taxation, but we are confident this can be afforded."
CAN_a_cooperative_commonwealth: "A Cooperative Commonwealth"
CAN_a_cooperative_commonwealth_desc: "This will be Canada's Century! From Alberta to Quebec, the Canadian flag flies proud and high over the country, as our government has built up a better Canada for all. Abroad, Canadian interests are represented - often with diplomatic words, and sometimes with military force. A strong economy, joyous people, and secure government have created a nation to be envied by all."
CAN_confidence_in_canada: "Confidence in Canada"
CAN_confidence_in_canada_desc: "At last, the great reforms have been completed. There is still work to do, most assuredly, but our administration's goals have by and large been completed. No citizen must go without their essential needs, as our government provides for everyone. The freedom to live and enjoy living - that is the promise we have offered, and Canada has certainly risen to the challenge of meeting it. No matter what comes next, the Canadian people will stand, confident and strong, to meet it!"

CAN_St_Laurent_victory_1953: "Louis St.Laurent's Liberal Victory"
CAN_St_Laurent_victory_1953_desc: "At last, the Liberals have emerged as the triumphant party in the 1953 elections. However, there's no time to simply bask in our victory - there's work to be done and a country to be improved, after all. Our enemies, and especially the more radical parties, will surely be working to block our progress. Today, the people have chosen to move forward, and we are determined - now more than ever - to bring a better Canada for all."
CAN_managing_prosperity: "Managing Prosperity"
CAN_managing_prosperity_desc: "If the Canadian economy is to truly expand and grow healthier under our party, we shall have to embark upon a yearlong program of widespread, small-scale investment. What's the point of merely enhancing the wealth of a few rich men in Ottawa? By giving each of our citizens an equal benefit, support for our government can be raised. It might well be a good idea to improve the infrastructure and economic framework in our more distant provinces too, which can often feel somewhat cut off from political decision making. This plan will show our appreciation for each facet of Canadian life, as well as our commitment to its improvement."
CAN_modest_increase_pensions_social_services: "Modest Increases to Social Services"
CAN_modest_increase_pensions_social_services_desc: "Spending on social services ought to be increased so that every Canadian has what they need. In order to ensure this, the Welfare Expansion Act will be proposed in Parliament. Now, it's a certainty that this bill will pass...but nonetheless, it might be wise to hold back on some of the largest spending proposals for now. Not that the issue has been forever put aside, of course - future proposals can surely expand this measure. Obviously, passing a bill for increased spending now could give our government's enemies some ammunition - but the improvement of conditions for Canadian citizens has to come first, and it's really only a small hike."
CAN_modern_trade_economics: "Modern Trade and Economics"
CAN_modern_trade_economics_desc: "As the landscape of trade shifts and advances, so too must Canada if we are to retain our prosperity and economic health. By the implementation of the very latest and most modern ideas in economics, Canada will be refined into a true global leader in international trade and industry alike. Each citizen will reap the benefits, and the world can behold the abilities of a stable, united, modern Canadian nation. Each new technique, each new process, each new method - all will be used for our national advancement, growth, and refinement! "
CAN_business_like_efficiency: "Business-like Efficiency"
CAN_business_like_efficiency_desc: "A Canadian business is run with precision; Canadian government requires nothing less! Of course, our traditions, discipline, and rules must still be followed; that aside, we're confident that the moral disintegration of Canadian bureaucracy is best prevented by an adoption of business management techniques. When each of our employees has the chance to see the wonders wrought around them, we can well expect them to appreciate our government's reforms and newly efficient nature. "
CAN_contributory_health_insurance: "Contributory Health Insurance"
CAN_contributory_health_insurance_desc: "Every Canadian should have the opportunity to receive more inexpensive health insurance, and a contributory system is one of the easiest - and least controversial - options for getting this through. Our population will stay healthy and safe under this new bill! On the other hand, some of our advisors suggest a level of increased cost for the administration that's worrying to some. Still, even our opponents will surely admit the value of structured, contributory health insurance being prioritized with our new Contributory Health Act. "
CAN_fair_employment_practices_bargaining_rights: "Fair Employment Practices"
CAN_fair_employment_practices_bargaining_rights_desc: "Across the nation, too many workers have to put up with labor practices that are unfair and immoral. Why do only a small percentage of Canadians get to make a profit off the masses' work? The government clearly has to step in and regulate this behavior, restoring a workplace where Candians can feel well-treated. Admittedly, production in some areas might lower somewhat, but what price is that to pay compared to fixing the current problems? Soon, no employer will be able to exploit their workers under the terms that are currently permitted."
CAN_federal_support_universities: "Federal Support for Universities"
CAN_federal_support_universities_desc: "The Canadian education system requires more funding, particularly at the higher levels. If the young minds of Canada are going to reach their greatest potential, we have to create state funding programs for universities. Furthermore, we can't just focus on the few elite schools; it's necessary for all of Canada to have such opportunities, no matter where they live or their current social class. Our curriculums will be brought up to international standard, too, and no radicalism can be allowed to permeate the minds of students at our universities. The more educated Canada of tomorrow, shaped by us today! "
CAN_rise_of_white_collar: "The Rise of White Collar Workers"
CAN_rise_of_white_collar_desc: "Across the quickly-industrializing Canadian landscape, one can find a recent surge in the levels of white-collar workers. Performing administrative tasks, generally from their work desk, an increase in their numbers also implies an increase in the average standard of living for our citizens. Furthermore, they can be put to the government's use directly and indirectly - staffing our bureaus or increasing the efficiency of regions currently under development. Our larger cities, such as Toronto or Montreal, will likely also see an increase in industrial productivity and efficiency. The economy just keeps growing, and it seems like nothing can stop our government's progression now."
CAN_building_new_ties_with_defenceindustrial_multiplex: "Working with the Defence Multiplex"
CAN_building_new_ties_with_defenceindustrial_multiplex_desc: "No matter how odious we may occasionally find them, the 'defence multiplex' - as it's commonly called - is vital to our military industry. If our administration is to effectively mobilize to any potential war effort that might be called for, a firm set of agreements with the multiplex is absolutely necessary. Armaments, vehicles, aircraft, and equipment are all areas they have both great experience and great capabilities in. A Canada with a strong multiplex is a safe, if not entirely ideal, Canada."
CAN_serving_the_domestic_market: "Serving the Domestic Market"
CAN_serving_the_domestic_market_desc: "Though our wartime industry may well save us one day, Canada's civilian and domestic economies need to be focused on. International trade, though appealing, ultimately serves us as a method of improving conditions for each Canadian citizen. Why waste time on making others' economies better when we can invest more into our own? By adopting a widespread program to improve production of appliances and items required by Canadian families, everyone within the country can have their needs satisfied. This initiative could also be easily expanded in the future to include more theories and resources at our disposal. "
CAN_stimulating_growth_of_consumer_needs: "Stimulating Growth of Consumer Needs"
CAN_stimulating_growth_of_consumer_needs_desc: "Recently, the wishes of Canadian households have been inclined towards developing an 'ideal' Canadian family, equipped with each modern appliance that our factories now produce. We need to focus on this sector, refining our ideas on financial policy and testing them out in what seems to be a rapidly growing area. Canada's civilian economy will be strengthened while this is implemented, and it may even experience a new period of rejuvenation and optimism!"
CAN_finishing_the_megaprojects: "Finishing the Megaprojects"
CAN_finishing_the_megaprojects_desc: "Former administrations have tried to invest government spending into megaprojects, such as dams and bridges, to create big and imposing structures. While we see this as a rather foolish waste, we have nonetheless inherited several white elephants from the government preceding us - and their cancelation would be viewed as a sign of our ineffectuality. A brief spurt of activity on the sites should be enough to more or less wrap them up, at which point we'd be happy to share with the people our great improvements to the Canadian landscape. Loudly. "
CAN_serving_quebec_business_needs: "Serving Quebec's Business Needs"
CAN_serving_quebec_business_needs_desc: "The Quebecois must be brought into the fold of a united and proud Canada, and the best method of achieving this is through an economically strong Quebec! While our earlier industrial efforts were dispersed across the nation, this new wave has to be concentrated on key cities, particularly those with Francophones. Both citizens and business owners alike will be gratified by this program, and already we've received inquiries from several prominent industrialists with interests in the region. Some analysts suggest that Quebec ought to simply be left to its own devices, granted autonomy in its business so that they can realize all we do for them, but how could anyone say Quebec is not Canadian? No matter how estranged they may have been, every part of Canada will be strongest together."
CAN_closing_the_pipeline_debate: "The Mature Canada"
CAN_closing_the_pipeline_debate_desc: "At last, our administration has truly accomplished all its goals. Canada stands ready to face the modern age, its citizens proud and content, its economic power refined. The rest of the world may consider their paths with uncertainty, but we will be a beacon of peaceful stability, come what may. A Liberal Canada has surely been conclusively proven the most efficient one, and our rivals in Parliament can hardly do more than sneer at us as improvement after improvement is effected by our government. Youthful, insolent America might have held the torch of liberty before - but it is the wise and matronly Canada who has certainly taken it up now."

CAN_bilingual_partnersihp: "Bilingual Partnership"
CAN_bilingual_partnersihp_desc: "The two languages with the greatest number of speakers in Canada - French and English - have always been rather at odds; Francophones distrusting Anglophones, and vice versa. If Canada can ever find her rightful national identity, this simply cannot do. While some harbor doubts about the veracity of the proposal, with one MP noting that the creation of a fictional meteorite would be a less extreme measure, everyone ultimately agrees that this neatly solves two long-standing issues that have blemished Canada for years. Under a new program of 'Partnership Without Precedence', the government will help to encourage communication and ease of use for both languages. Important announcements will be distributed in both, among other new or revised measures, and so a Canadian culture that can take pride in either language can finally come about."
CAN_rekindle_canadian_nationalism: "Rekindle Canadian Nationalism"
CAN_rekindle_canadian_nationalism_desc: "A Canada that is strong, a Canada that is free; how can this Canada be filled with anything less than a people fully dedicated to the nation they know to be theirs? Every citizen, and every province, will be united in a new movement to truly mobilize our country. By forming a strong central identity for our people - which has previously been comparatively absent when one observes nations such as Germany or France - Canada will be ready to truly enter the modern era. And not as a Canada divided, not as a Canada marked by instability and uncertainty, but as a proud Canada! A bold Canada! A Canada that is ascendant upon the world stage, and a Canada fully prepared to assert her rightful place upon it."
CAN_national_council_on_the_arts: "Establish the Canada Council"
CAN_national_council_on_the_arts_desc: "No culture is without its valued art and history, and Canada's is surely no different. With the establishment of a group to oversee this aspect of society, we can encourage the development of the next generation of Canadian artists while also promoting adults' interest in the arts as well. By funding public arts, our children can learn from an early age the value of artistry, and of the enjoyment they may take from it. The Canada Council for the Arts is going to be a valued Crown Corporation, and with it we shall bring all the arts to life!"

CAN_the_mature_canada: "New Canadian Identity"
CAN_the_mature_canada_desc: "Canada has gone through challenges innumerable in the last two decades, yet she has come out of them stronger than ever. We are now more united, stronger, and secure in our identity than ever before. This new identity has been shaped by Liberal governance, and it is to be celebrated. We shall organize campaigns to remind the Canadian populace of the identity we have developed, and how the Liberal Party was there through all of the struggles."

#Conservatives
CAN_Diefenbaker_victory_1953: "John Diefenbaker's Conservative Victory"
CAN_Diefenbaker_victory_1953_desc: "To Diefenbaker! The Progressive Conservative Party stands victorious at the helm of the Canadian nation, and we can to begin to push for our programs. Our country's issues are myriad and entangled, but the guiding hand of Conservatism will see us safely through."
CAN_creation_canadian_human_rights: "The Canadian Human Rights Commision"
CAN_creation_canadian_human_rights_desc: "Some Canadians can still not feel accepted within our country, and this is a widespread problem that has to be addressed before we try to tackle the others. A new vision for Canada, with entirely equal opportunities for everyone, will reshape this negative framework utilizing a commision designed for this purpose. Of course, our government cannot and should not micromanage everyone's issues, so it will in some capacity leave the task of solving problems to the person who brought them forth. Nonetheless, it will certainly still have a positive impact, and inspire confidence in all our citizens."
CAN_restricting_order_in_council: "Studying State Discrimination"
CAN_restricting_order_in_council_desc: "One Canada deserves a voice on the world stage, one that is unhindered by those who would seek to drown out our positions. Our agenda of restricting order in council will ensure that all our foreign-policy goals can at least have a chance of success, and we will have - one way or another - a chance at a Canadian Century. Canada's interests will be heard by the world."
CAN_salutez_votre_chef: "Saluez Votre Chef!"
CAN_salutez_votre_chef_desc: "Who can dispute the fact that Quebec is an integral part of the Canadian national body? Some within Quebec itself, apparently, have attempted to. If Canada is to assert her proper place, she must be made truly whole in spirit - and not only on paper. A new piece of legislation will be drafted to fully assimilate this province's inhabitants, and bring Quebec back into our embracing fold. Québécois, saluez votre chef naturel!"
CAN_soften_immigration_laws: "Soften Immigration Laws"
CAN_soften_immigration_laws_desc: "For our nation to grow, it must draw upon human resources from across the globe. With revised immigration policies, fewer will be blocked from their desire to contribute to Canadian greatness. Let immigrants come from every corner of the world, so that they - and Canada - can be improved together. "
CAN_calls_for_equality_one_canada: "Calls of Equality in the Era of One Canada"
CAN_calls_for_equality_one_canada_desc: "All of our citizens will have the opportunity to improve their lives and make the country stronger. Whether they choose to utilize this capability is left in their hands, for why should we try to bolster those meant for society's bottom level? Every desirable element of a culture can be incorporated for One Canada, strong together! "
CAN_canadian_bill_of_rights_dief: "The Canadian Bill of Rights"
CAN_canadian_bill_of_rights_dief_desc: "Our government needs a bill of rights to give certain guaranteed freedoms to all Canadian citizens. It's not enough that they're "implied" in the constitution; a document of substance has to be laid out. Of course, it will have flexibility of interpretation so it can adjust to different scenarios, but this is what makes it so strong! Our critics may regard this notion with scorn, but we have confidence our system will be made stronger and grander than ever before."
CAN_strengthen_bill_of_rights: "Strengthen the Bill of Rights"
CAN_strengthen_bill_of_rights_desc: "In hindsight, that noble principle of flexibility in the Bill of Rights may have been spurred by misguided beliefs amongst party leadership. Recent developments have made it somewhat evident that we need a more rigorously applied set of guiding ideas, and the purposely vague nature of the previous act made it a grave headache for proper government functionality."
CAN_western_canada_one_canada: "Western Canada for One Canada"
CAN_western_canada_one_canada_desc: "All parts of Canada, regardless of their current development or value to us, should be given sufficient allocation of funds to strengthen their local economies. One Canada will prosper together, bold and united by the common cause across our vast nation. It must be made quite clear, however, that there will be no handouts from our government: going forward, provinces must earn their keep to continue their receipt of federal funding."
CAN_social_justice_one_canada: "Economic Justice in One Canada"
CAN_social_justice_one_canada_desc: "Every Canadian citizen fully deserves the opportunity to prosper as much as their counterparts, no matter their skin color or creed. The equality of opportunity is a crucial principle of our government's leadership, and one that must be fully upheld for our vision to be fully realized. This doesn't mean, however, that we must go to the other extreme and give direct support to every person within the country (as some would have us do). Our motivation is simply that all people are owed the ability to have fulfilling lives within One Canada."
CAN_expansion_old_age_pension: "Expansion of Old Age Pension"
CAN_expansion_old_age_pension_desc: "Our elders, those who have given this country as much as they can all their lives, deserve compensation. Under the present system, the money they are given is practically a paltry sum, insufficient to properly care for their needs. Our government will show that it values them as integral components of our nation, having brought up the young in the proper ways, and expand the payments they are owed. No future vision may be completed without addressing properly those who have made it possible."
CAN_expand_national_healthcare: "Expand The National Health Scheme"
CAN_expand_national_healthcare_desc: "No Canadian citizen is unworthy of our government's aid - yet currently, that aid is still financially limited in its scale. By revising our laws upon the subject, we can create a more equal platform for us all to be healthy, whole, and ready to give all that we may to One Canada - a Canada far stronger together than divided by the concerns of health costs."
CAN_war_veterans_allowance_benefits: "War Veterans Allowance Benefits"
CAN_war_veterans_allowance_benefits_desc: "Those who have stood ready to make the greatest sacrifice for our nation must be honored after their return to the country. This may be economically taxing, but our countrymen will surely be gratified to see that we respect their courage and selflessness. A grateful nation shall never forget its veterans' service."
CAN_national_development_policy: "The National Development Policy"
CAN_national_development_policy_desc: "A uniform plan, calling for the directing of state resources into those areas of Canada which have not yet been developed sufficiently, will give our economy a sharp boost. This NDP is a definite and concrete proof of our party's advancement, as well as our interest in the economic vitality of all our citizens."
CAN_continue_northern_vision: "Continue the Northern Vision"
CAN_continue_northern_vision_desc: "Canada's borders stretch across some of the largest areas in the world, with the longest coastline of any nation. Nonetheless, so much of our territory is undeveloped, particularly in the frigid northern regions. Previous administrations have launched projects to improve these areas, but it is ours which shall succeed!"
CAN_atlantic_development_board: "Altantic Development Board"
CAN_atlantic_development_board_desc: "Canada's coasts have historically been her most valuable geographic feature, and even today they form inroads for trade and industry throughout the nation. A program to develop the land adjoining them could yield great results, increasing further the prosperity within these regions."
CAN_supporting_canadian_farmers: "Supporting Canadian Farmers"
CAN_supporting_canadian_farmers_desc: "The Canadian farmer is a cornerstone of our economy, with agriculture supplying our nation - and many others besides - with vital resources. The government ought to support them and make sure this sector remains profitable for those currently partaking in it."
CAN_save_the_tax: "Save The Tax"
CAN_save_the_tax_desc: "Certain political elements within Canada support dangerous tax changes, which ought to be nipped in the bud. A new reform to our tax codes will ensure that the future generations of Canadians will be taxed as much or as little as they truly deserve!"
CAN_atlantic_offshore_drilling: "Atlantic Offshore Drilling"
CAN_atlantic_offshore_drilling_desc: "Oil! Mountains of oil...if only we could access it. Government resources should be immediately directed towards finding and exploiting these deposits, which we strongly suspect lie off our coastal regions. Black gold will be a valuable economic boon."
CAN_small_business_big_projects: "Small Business in Big Projects"
CAN_small_business_big_projects_desc: "The private sector is a valuable asset for construction, one not fully taken advantage of. Contracting out work to these smaller businesses will give them opportunities to grow and let us take advantage of their small-scale expertise. Private industry will propel Canada into her industrialized future!"
CAN_the_commonwealth_market: "The Commonwealth Market"
CAN_the_commonwealth_market_desc: "Canadian trade routes stretch around the globe to all nations willing to do business with us - but what of technology? We must ready our friends for their coming conflicts, and provide our allies with a method to stand up against potential German aggression in the ongoing Kalte Krieg. "
CAN_modernize_diversity_touristify_maritimes: "Toursistify the Maritimes"
CAN_modernize_diversity_touristify_maritimes_desc: "The Maritimes - Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island - are among the most beautiful and remarkable regions of Canada. If only the rest of the world were able to see that, and appreciate their natural splendor! We must invest in infrastructure to permit visitors, both foreign and from other provinces, to visit these areas."
CAN_opportunities_for_young: "Opportunities for the Young"
CAN_opportunities_for_young_desc: "Canada's youth are her future, as with all nations, and a future that must be carefully molded.

CAN_one_canada_in_one_world: "One Canada in One World"

CAN_bennett_victory_1953: "W.A.C Bennett's Unionist Victory"
CAN_bennett_victory_1953_desc: "Working his characteristic political magic, W.A.C. Bennett has led the Unionist Party to victory against the competition. Now, however, he must keep the power that has been obtained - and this may not be such an easy task for a party many see as cobbled together from the remnants of greater, nobler efforts."
CAN_handling_the_aristocracy: "Handling the Aristocracy"
CAN_handling_the_aristocracy_desc: "A possible base of support for the administration lies in the aristocrats inside Canada, but their help could come at a price. Some might see collaboration with them as a weak move, perhaps even betraying our voters, yet it's undeniable that we could do far more with their support than without. Moving against their interests might win more popular appreciation; either way, we'll have to construct a cohesive policy around them."
CAN_the_western_base: "The Western Base"
CAN_the_western_base_desc: "So many of our supporters are within the western provinces - Alberta and British Columbia arguably won us the election. We should aid them in turn, bringing industry and an improved economy to areas  neglected by other governments. The Unionists remember their own!"
CAN_the_quebec_traditionalists: "The Quebec Traditionalists"
CAN_the_quebec_traditionalists_desc: "Some of the staunchest Unionist bases of support are within Quebec, and we promised the people there that their views would be represented. More than simply political representation, however, they want a material reward. There is no reason to not give it to them, and improve the industry of one of our most populous provinces."
CAN_beautiful_british_columbia: "Beautiful British Columbia"
CAN_beautiful_british_columbia_desc: "...reads a recent tourism pamphlet inviting visitors to the westernmost Canadian province. With spectacular natural scenery, the region has always commanded the attention of international travelers to our country. Why not complement that by supporting industrial development?"
CAN_oil_it_will_be: "Oil It Will Be"
CAN_oil_it_will_be_desc: "So much untapped potential lies beneath Canadian ground in our western provinces. Black gold is the resource of today, and we must utilize it or risk falling behind our international competition. No time should be wasted - oil it will be!"
CAN_build_the_damn_highways: "Build the Damn Highways!"
CAN_build_the_damn_highways_desc: "Where others have failed, the Unionists will succeed! One way or another, we will complete the Trans-Canada Highway and bring together sections of the country heretofore unconnected. The automobile is the symbol of Canadian success, and we will spare no effort in its spread."
CAN_increasing_provincial_powers: "Increasing Provincial Powers"
CAN_increasing_provincial_powers_desc: "Those who know best how to run their region deserve greater control. The federal government should realize its limitations and back away from local affairs; this leaves us free to focus on the bigger picture while provincial bureaucrats keep Canada humming along. "
CAN_favouring_the_majority: "Majoritarian Government"
CAN_favouring_the_majority_desc: "Our government has been invested by the people with a mandate to govern; declining to use it would practically be treasonous, as would acting against their interests. By truly representing all Canadians who support us, we'll gain support and maintain the Unionist mandate for as long as we should wish it. As long as the people should wish it, that is."
CAN_stopping_state_socialism: "Stopping State Socialism"
CAN_stopping_state_socialism_desc: "Some officials, not of our government, have taken steps to consolidate control over the people they are meant to serve. While they may claim to be acting in their best interests, these self-serving socialists look out for only themselves. Clear delineation of where government responsibility ends will hopefully purge the system of such rot."
CAN_loosen_the_tax_codes_deregulation: "Loosen the Tax Codes and Deregulation"
CAN_loosen_the_tax_codes_deregulation_desc: "Too many Canadian citizens have suffered under unfair tax laws, taking far more than their due. Government interference in economic affairs is a doomed proposal; no one deserves to be so closely monitored by an agency they may not know or trust. "
CAN_pay_as_you_go: "Pay As You Go"
CAN_pay_as_you_go_desc: "By taxing people on a basis of their monthly income, they can never be caught unawares by some absurd demand they knew nothing of beforehand. Clarity and good will in tax enforcement can sway the electorate, even if at the expense of lightening our income."
CAN_competitive_free_enterprise: "Competitive Free Enterprise"
CAN_competitive_free_enterprise_desc: "The freer the market, the healthier the economy. Private investors need to have as many opportunities as possible to protect their interests, and defend them from rivals. How can any federal organization know better than they do? The economy belongs in the hands of the people who it's made up of."
CAN_assuring_export_market: "Assuring the Export Market"
CAN_assuring_export_market_desc: "The heart of Canadian industry lies in its connections abroad, and the entire structure balances upon our exports of both raw materials and consumer goods. We need to emphasize both aspects to ensure long-lasting trade security, despite possible shifts in the global situation."
CAN_dont_tread_on_others: "Privatize the Crown Corporations"
CAN_dont_tread_on_others_desc: "What good do Crown Corporations really do in the government's hands? Privatizing these entities will make them contribute far more than they can currently, when placed under individuals with years of experience and firm goals to achieve. Their dream was noble, but flawed; the least profitable simply cannot be kept."
CAN_new_changes_to_detainment: "Expand the War Measures Act"
CAN_new_changes_to_detainment_desc: "In a time of national peril, internal security cannot be compromised! Under no condition may we permit untrustworthy factions at home to take advantage of our involvement abroad. The War Measures Act served us well through both world wars; in this age of yet more strife, its necessity is unquestionable."
CAN_supressing_socialism: "Declare a State of Insurrection"
CAN_supressing_socialism_desc: "Throughout the country, distasteful elements of our society have begun to surface. Masquerading as a legitimate political party under the name of the CCF, their dangerous and radical actions have finally gone too far! What self-respecting government can be asked to put up with such madness? Every citizen must see the danger they pose, and there is only one step certain to achieve this..."
CAN_production_is_consumption: "Production is Consumption"
CAN_production_is_consumption_desc: "Under our market system, one of the freest in the world, each product consumed is replaced as demand fills the gap. This creates a secure loop between the consumers and factories, certain to be unshaken by most economic hardship. In times of prosperity, too, it creates greater efficiency and speed of manufacture: nothing is wasted, nothing is wanted!"
CAN_except_when_its_in_our_interests: "Guided Capitalism"
CAN_except_when_its_in_our_interests_desc: "We will stand by - as we have always done - the statement that capitalism is unequivocally the world's best economic system. The prosperity we enjoyed after the fall of syndicalism as a predominant world force is easily the strongest evidence of this; nonetheless, some officials have begun to raise certain not unjustified doubts about a market being perhaps rather too free. Small steps to curb this effect should be taken, though without compromising our values, to keep the economy humming along."
CAN_increasing_military_strength: "Increase Military Strength"
CAN_increasing_military_strength_desc: "The world stands at a time of growing crisis. Conflicts half a world away erupt, and Canada will be prepared! Whether it's defending the values we hold dear in the name of another regime or fighting those who would take our hard-won gains away from us, nothing will be held back against the enemy. An effort now might mean the difference between victory or defeat later on."
CAN_pass_canadian_values_act: "Pass the Canadian Values Act"
CAN_pass_canadian_values_act_desc: "Canadian spirit is what has made her great, what makes her great, what will do so for decades or centuries to come! Acting now to defend our proud traditions is to be one of our government's great contributions to our nation's lasting success. Those who would tear us down will find themselves cast aside in turn."
CAN_valuing_the_family: "Valuing the Family"
CAN_valuing_the_family_desc: "What can be more central to Canadian life than the house and family, cornerstones of each citizen's contentment? Government policies supporting young Canadians in starting their own households will ensure it remains so for years more, and reinforce the bonds holding our nation together."
CAN_the_obedient_canada: "The Stalwart Dominion"
CAN_the_obedient_canada_desc: "Whatever the future may bring, Canada will be prepared. However the economy may change, Canada will be prepared.

krg_can.0.a: "May the best man win."

krg_can.1.t: "John Diefenbaker wins the Liberal Convention!"
krg_can.1.d: "The results of the Liberal Leadership Convention is clear. John Diefenbaker is now the Liberal party's candidate for the position of Prime Minister!\n\nA Conservative Liberal of German descent, Diefenbaker is a somewhat controversial pick due to Canada and Germany's increasingly poor relations. However his loyalty to Canada is unquestionable. During the Second Weltkrieg, Diefenbaker worked closely with Sir King to ensure Canada's stability.\n\nWith a German-Canadian immigrant history, Diefenbaker is a proof enough that Liberalism is not bound to nationality or heritage. "
krg_can.1.a: "Congratulations to Mr. Diefenbaker"

krg_can.2.t: "Kingsley Wood wins the Conservative Convention!"
krg_can.2.d: "The results of the Conservative Leadership Convention is clear. Kingsley Wood is now the Conservative party's candidate for the position of Prime Minister!\n\nA British Exile, Kingsley's pro-british tendencies are no secret, and now that he is the Conservative Party's chosen candidate, it's clear that the Conservatives share these sympathies as well. An able economist, many in the Conservatives believe that Wood will be able to bring Canada to new heights.\n\nSome are worried that Kingsley's views on Britain are deluded and his policies will actively work against Canadian interests, but that has yet to be seen."
krg_can.2.a: "Congratulations to Mr. Wood"

krg_can.3.t: "George A. Drew wins the Conservative Convention!"
krg_can.3.d: "The results of the Conservative Leadership Convention is clear. George A. Drew is now the Conservative party's candidate for the position of Prime Minister!\n\nGeorge A. Drew's Canadian Nationalism is a controversial topic to say the least. The Conservative delegation have clearly chosen him for his Canadian pride, hoping that it would inspire like minded voters and lead the conservatives to win the election. However, his distaste for the French-Canadians is no secret. Many are worried that his 'Nationalism' is just Anglo-Supremacy in disguise.\n\nIf George A. Drew is elected, we hope that the Canadian Nationalism he holds is one that will unite Canada, not open old wounds."
krg_can.3.a: "Congratulations to Mr. Drew"

krg_can.4.t: "Louis St. Laurent wins the Liberal Convention!"
krg_can.4.d: "The results of the Liberal Leadership Convention is clear. Louis St.Laurent is now the Liberal party's candidate for the position of Prime Minister!\n\nWith St.Laurent's service as the leader of the Louis St Laurent society, he helped Canada's culture and politics in line with Canadian values. Initial concerns regarding Louis St Laurent being the head of an arguable secret police as well as the Canadian prime-minister would lead to an authoritarian regime, St.Laurent has agreed to transfer leadership of the society and reform it into something better suited for Canada's current situation.\n\nLouis St Laurent has been an influential man, one that will unite Canadians of all backgrounds."
krg_can.4.a: "Congratulations to Mr. St. Laurent"

krg_can.11.t: "The War is Over!"
krg_can.11.d: "A feeling of relief and of triumph is present over the Dominion of Canada! After seven long years of bloodshed, of struggle, of turning back the Syndicalist tides in Europe and of reclaiming our homeland, the Entente and its allies have emerged victorious in this most destructive of conflicts. As soon as news of Mosley's death and the surrender of the Maximist regime came in, an eruption of celebrations swept our country. Every Canadian, from the big cities to the little towns and villages in the interior provinces have been seized by this wave, save for some sections of the French community, who are simply relieved that the war is over. Soldiers have already begun returning from war-torn Europe, and the port cities receiving them have been overrun by their families, who have been aching to see their sons ever since Canada entered the Weltkrieg. "
krg_can.11.a: "Victory, Pride, and Peace! The beginning of the Canadian Century! "

krg_can.12.t: "Parliament Creates the Special Flag Committee"
krg_can.12.d: "Canadian national identity has been a subject of national debate long before the exiles entered the country through Grosse Isle. Despite Canada's place within the Empire, there has been a great flag debate for decades in Canada. Most recently was the 1925 committee to design a flag for the country, but solidarity with those fleeing the British Revolution shut down any attempt to remove the Union Jack Canada's flag then.\nCanada has been using the \"Red Ensign\" for decades now, but many people in and out of government have been calling for its replacement. Canada stands as one of the victors of the Second Weltkrieg. She has delivered the exiles home and now sits at the head of The Accord. To this end, the House of Commons has voted to create a Special Flag Committee led by Canadian Army veteran and vexillologist Archer F. Duguid. This committee will research Canadian national symbols and draft a proposal for a new flag that allows Canada to stand on its own on the international stage."
krg_can.12.a: "With the headaches this will cause, the entire country will need aspirin!"

krg_can.13.t: "Special Flag Committee Remains Divided "
krg_can.13.d: "Today, Parliament approved the Special Flag Committee's request to extend the deadline to find a new flag by six weeks as the committee failed to reach a consensus on a new flag last Monday. The 15 member committee of seven Liberals, six Conservatives, and two minor party MPs were unable to reach a 2/3 majority vote as the Conservatives and Liberals failed to reach a consensus on a potential design. As such, Parliament has given a new deadline of six weeks for the committee to decide on a new flag and has permitted the committee to allow for public entries.\n\nCanadians have been divided on the issue of a new flag as it comes apparent that it is one of the most emotion-packed problems of our time with some people saying that it should have never been brought up. Despite a poll in 1946 showing that 70% of Canadians approved a \"National Flag different from any other,\" new polls show a much more divided country, with only 44% of Canadians support of the proposed one leaf Scott-Trudel pennant while 43% oppose. An unsympathetic audience jeered foreign Minister Lester B. Pearson in an address at the 8th Royal Canadian Legion Convention after stating that \"Today a flag designed around the maple leaf will symbolize and be a true reflection of the new Canada.\"\n\nNewly-elected Conservative leader George A. Drew and controversial Liberal MP John Diefenbaker have condemned Pearson and the flag as \"triumphing over the spirit and thus not in keeping with democracy.\" Lieutenant John Ross Matheson of the Association of a Native Sons of Canada defended the flag process stating, \"The world needs to know we are Canada, born and free again independent of others.\" Colonel George Stanley of the Royal Canadian College warned that the process \"Must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature so as to keep national unity.\""
krg_can.13.a: "To think this will be a unifying process!"

krg_can.14.t: "Fist Fights on Parliament Hill Over Flag Debate!"
krg_can.14.d: "The Great Flag Debate took a violent turn yesterday as fists were shared between rival groups as demonstrators gathered on Parliament Hill to show support for and anger over proposed national flags. A thousand strong group gathered on the west side of the walkway, lobbying for proposed designs while another group, equally large, singing God Save the King, stood on the east side waving the Red Ensign, the de facto flag of Canada.\n\nDivided by police barriers, the two bands faced each other, booing and making catcalls as Mounties walked slowly between the main walkway to the Centre Block between the two groups. However, as crowd tension grew, some zealous demonstrators jumped over the police barrier and began hurling fists at each other. More people from both factions joined in the fisticuffs before police intervened.\n\nIt is unclear as to which faction is responsible for starting the fighting. The RCMP reported that they made five arrests from the fight while a dozen or so individuals were treated for minor injuries. Organizers from both sides have asked for calm while Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King warned MPs not to turn the debate into a partisan issue. When asked about the scuffle, lead proponent of the flag change and Foreign Minister Lester B. Pearson commented "Whatever the issue might be, we mustn't act in the against our fellow Canadians."\n\nThe fight comes only two weeks before the Special Flag Committee must decide on a flag according to the hard deadline set by Parliament. Canadians in English Canada remain bitterly divided on existing proposed designs while French Quebeckers seem to be indifferent to the matter. It's unclear if the SFC has made any progress at all."
krg_can.14.a: "All this anger over a bloody flag."

krg_can.15.t: "Special Flag Committee Decides!"
krg_can.15.d: "The SFC has finally made a decision on the unnecessarily arduous task of choosing a flag.\n\nTowards the end of the sixth week given to the Special Flag Committee, no decision was made on the Scott-Trudel design, with the Conservatives looking to wrap things up and anticipating a political victory. At close to the last moment, MP Donald Ferguson Brown presented Lester Pearson and the committee a design that had been submitted to him by Colonel George Stanley in March. Stanley's design - three red maple leafs in a white space flanked by vertical bars and a sliver of two blue bars - was semi-inspired by the Royal Military College flag. A very similar design came shortly after from Lieutenant John Matheson which changed the proportions of the leaves. A more professional drawing was eventually made by graphic artist Jacques Saint-Cyr of the Canadian Government Exhibition Commision.\n\nThe committee narrowed the field to a choice between the Scott-Trudel design championed by Pearson and by the Prime Minister and the Stanley pennant. The Conservatives assumed Liberals members would vote for Pearson's first choice. So instead, they voted for Stanley's design. But the Liberals and other minor party members voted for the Stanley design as well. On 22 October, 1948, the committee voted unanimously (14-1; the chair abstained) in favour of the Stanley design.\n\nThe Committee will present their chosen design next week."
krg_can.15.a: "Good Grief!"

krg_can.16.t: "The Stanley Flag Passes in the Commons!"
krg_can.16.d: "Mike Pearson has finally pulled through with his ambition. Canada has a new flag unlike any other in its history. It will replace the old ensign in the coming months, marking the end of one era and the beginning of another. The beginning of a bold and promising world.\n\nThe Special Flag Committee's choice was presented to the House of Commons. But the Conservatives continued their bitter opposition to a new flag calling the SFC vote, a trick. They filibustered and dragged the debate on for another four weeks with some witnesses to the events calling the debates among the ugliest they ever saw.\n\nFinally, Léon Balcer, a prominent Conservative MP from Quebec, broke ranks and invited the Liberals to invoke closure. That limited speeches to 20 minutes and forced a vote. After some 250 speeches, a vote was taken last night, at 2:15 a.m. The committee's recommendation of the Stanley Flag was accepted by a vote of 238 to 100. Immediately after the vote, Brown wrote a postcard to George Stanley, saying, "Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 238 to 100. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well."\n\nThe Senate will give its approval next week, followed by a royal proclamation by His Majesty within the month.\n\nMike Pearson has realized his dream. A dream that many Canadians share. A dream that many Canadians worry about. A bold and promising dream that fosters the best out of us. But also a dream requiring undercurrents where grim choices force us out of our innocence."
krg_can.16.a: "I think a drink is due for all of us after that entire mess. "

krg_can.17.t: "The Inauguration of the National Flag"
krg_can.17.d: "On September 5, 1935 an Order-in-Council was passed declaring the Red Ensign to be Canada's National Flag pending a decision of the Parliament of Canada.\n\nSuch a decision was made well over a decade later, after a long and vigorous Parliamentary debate and careful Committee consideration and recommendation.\n\nAs a result of this decision by the Canadian Parliament and on the advice of the Government of Canada, His Majesty, our beloved King, was pleased to issue a Proclamation that the Flag we are about to raise today should be the Flag of Canada. So, at noon today, in this eighth month of our eighty-second year as a Confederation, our new Flag will fly for the first time in the skies above Canada and in places overseas where Canadians serve.\n\nIf our nation, by God's grace, endures a thousand years, this day will always be remembered as a milestone in Canada's national progress.\n\nGod bless our Flag, God bless Canada!"
krg_can.17.a: "And God save the King!"

krg_can.18.t: "Paul Martin Sr.'s Citizenship Act"
krg_can.18.d: "Sometimes it's easy to forget that Canada is still a relatively young country.\n\nAfter achieving an outstanding reputation in the First World War, where Canadians were widely recognized as the among the best of the Allied troops, and after the remarkable, bloody and critical achievements in the Reclamation War, and spite of those enormous national contributions, Canadians were still considered as British subjects. Subjects of a country and monarch that fell to tyranny, whose king and establishment we housed out of goodwill, and whose country we liberated for them to return to.\n\nIt was a Cabinet Minister Paul Martin Sr. that saw our desire to be a distinct nationality. After the visit to the Canadian military ceremony in the Isle of Man where so many Canadians died for freedom, Martin had rallied public support for a distinct citizenship. It was Martin who convinced King that indeed that our position in the world was greater than being a subject. The drafting of this act marks the beginning of the new era in the Canadian project. We strengthen our position as a sovereign nation and the growing desire to establish symbols of its independent nationhood. A nationhood with people who are growing a sense of national identity.\n\nAlthough all of us, except a minority of British aristocrats, agree that our distinct nationality, we have yet to decide on a critical part of citizenship that will have ramifications on our identity: Aside from Canadians, who too, can be Canadian?"
krg_can.18.a: "A truly momentous process."

krg_can.19.t: "The Prime Minister Approves the Citizenship Act"
krg_can.19.d: "Prime Minister Mackenzie King has shown his approval of Paul Martin Sr.'s Citizenship Act during a speech in Ottawa today. To a joyful crowd in the capital still celebrating Canada's victory in the Second Weltkrieg, the news that Canada would prioritize Canadian citizenship over British subjectitude only served to increase the fanfare. With widespread public support and the Prime Minister's blessing, there is little doubt that the bill will pass in Parliament.\n\nHowever, there are doubts over some specifics of the bill, and opposition parties are pressing for their own goals to be met in the bill. Details on who specifically gets citizenship and how immigration can be prioritized are, unfortunately, beginning to start debate in Parliament. While the Liberal party staunchly supports the bill, a choice may have to be made in how radical the bill will really be."
krg_can.19.a: "No longer British subjects, but Canadian citizens!"

krg_can.20.t: "The CCF Propose an Amendment"
krg_can.20.d: "As expected, the CCF has proposed an amendment that would radically alter the way Canadian immigration and citizenship is handled. The amendment would open up and encourage immigration for anyone in the world, truly making Canada the home of the free, for everyone. The Citizenship Act would thus allow anyone, of any nationality, to gain Canadian citizenship in a fair and equal fashion. Thus, it would most likely lead to a large increase in immigration, and a larger Canadian population overall.\n\nHowever, Conservatives staunchly oppose this amendment, and have stated that they will oppose it in any way they can. Leading Conservatives mention that the amendment is too radical, and the Citizenship Act should prioritize granting citizenship to those of British and Anglo descent, not just any nationality. They claim that the CCF's proposed amendment would destabilize Canada in the future, and muddle the Canadian identity.\n\nThe Liberal Party is currently divided between supporting the Amendment and opposing it, and groups from both sides have been trying to convince Prime Minister King to publicly support their interests in Parliament. This deadlock has to be straightened out before it further delays the passing of the Citizenship Act."
krg_can.20.a: "Allow the amendment, the Act will be a momentous one!"
krg_can.20.b: "Actually, a more conservative approach would be wise."

krg_can.21.t: "Tories Challenge the CCF's Amendment"
krg_can.21.d: "The Tories have pressed forward with their challenge to the CCF's proposed amendment on the Citizenship Act pertaining to immigration. What once was expected to be an act that would quickly fly through Parliament has now appeared to become a polarizing bill. The Liberals are in position to either press on with the CCF's amendment, or listen to the Tories and remove the amendment from the bill entirely. Prime Minister Mackenzie King has publicly supported the amendment, but may be willing to roll back his support to regain the support of the Conservative party. With the Prime Minister not fully on one side, the party itself remains divided on the issue, and there is a firm need from leadership to direct the party one way or another. The party whip is ready to hear from Prime Minister King for his advice on where to lead the party on this important, decisive vote. Without it, the bill may not pass."
krg_can.21.a: "Canada is a free nation, press on with the vote!"
krg_can.21.b: "National Unity is vital, roll back the Amendment"

krg_can.22.t: "The Canadian Citizenship Act Passes!"
krg_can.22.d: "The Canadian Citizenship Act has passed to much public approval, and bipartisan support from the Liberal and Conservative parties. The act will firmly create the idea of Canadian citizenship, not British subjectitude, and allow for easier immigration from nations which share an Anglo-British identity, such as Australia, America, and Britain itself. Conservatives and Liberals have lauded the act for furthering Canadian independence and leadership in the free world, as well as preserving Canada's western values. However, members of the CCF have been publicly critical about the outcome of the act, stating that it should have been far more reaching, and more inviting of immigrants from anywhere in the world to truly be the next home of the poor and outcast. However, their criticisms have mostly fallen on deaf ears as almost everyone begins to celebrate a new age of Canadian citizenship."
krg_can.22.a: "A toast to new citizenship and the preservation of our values!"

krg_can.23.t: "The Citizenship Act is Enshrined into Law"
krg_can.23.d: "Before the war, both people born in Canada and naturalized immigrants were considered British subjects. Our new found Canadian Citizenship Act that came into force recently is the first nationality law that defines our people as explicitly Canadian. The creation of the citizenship act is an expression of our identity and our place in the world. And well, given the circumstances of our heritage as a nation, we will focus our immigration efforts from places where we share blood and ancestral ties with the United Kingdom and the English-speaking Commonwealth.\n\nPrime Minister Mackenzie King made it clear his convictions of what's best for this nation means preserving the traditional fabric of the nation. After all he is the Prime Minister, and going against him in a sensitive time in our nation's history wouldn't be particularly productive. To say the least, the more profligate of the Liberal Party was not too pleased with this information so too the CCF. In contrast, the Conservatives and Unionists were celebrating this decision. Regardless, our identity has been formed and our place to newcomers for at least the next number of years.\n\nIn reality, we are unsure what non-English speaking countries will make of this decision. It might be a boon or it might be a decision we will have to reconsider. Whatever the case, the Canadian project is something bigger than ourselves.\n\nWhatever the case maybe we all agree on Minister Paul Martin Sr. remarks in this chapter of our history. "For the national unity of Canada and for the future and greatness of this country it is felt to be of utmost importance that all of us, new Canadians or old, have a consciousness of a common purpose and common interests as Canadians; that all of us are able to say with pride and say with meaning: 'I am a Canadian citizen'.""
krg_can.23.a: "God Bless Canada!"

krg_can.24.t: "The Canadian Citizenship Act Passes!"
krg_can.24.d: "The Canadian Citizenship Act has passed to much fanfare in Parliament, and bipartisan support from the Liberal Party and the CCF. A radical act, the Canadian Citizenship Act has amendments pertaining to the protection of immigration from anywhere in the world, regardless of nationality. This is sure to lead to a jump in immigration into Canada, and while some Conservatives have grumbled that a radical immigration bill would lead to the loss of Canadian values and morals, most Canadians have ignored these complaints, happy to finally have their own form of citizenship. This act seems to show how Canada is firmly entering a new, Liberal age, free of prejudice and providing a home to all."
krg_can.24.a: "Bring me your tired, your poor, Canada has open arms!"

krg_can.25.t: "The Citizenship Act is Enshrined into Law"
krg_can.25.d: "The bill is now law. It's the world we have decided on and that decision will have lasting effects. We've outlined the process and requirements for obtaining citizenship and it's with pride that is this right one.\n\nAlthough it took some compromising with Mackenzie King whose opinions on certain peoples made us put some technicalities, it is with gladness that the government has decided that Canadian citizenship will not be for a select people from a certain region or group of people, but with for those who have immigrated from all over the world and have decided to call Canada their home.\n\nAn unprecedented decision in our history, and world history, it is with hope that this will be the right one for the pursuit of freedom and equality for all. It plays into hands as well, where the many non-European countries will see as a people who not only welcome them but respect them for who they are. To be seen as the bastion of freedom has a geopolitical side as well.\n\nDespite our noble intention, some of the rumblings have came from old stock Canadians and some of the old British establishment who fear change in our changing country. That is to be expected though. There's something bigger we are working at that's larger than ourselves.\n\nAfter inaugurating the first official Canadian citizens, Minister Paul Martin Sr. had interesting closing remarks in this chapter of our history. "For the national unity of Canada and for the future and greatness of this country it is felt to be of utmost importance that all of us, new Canadians or old, have a consciousness of a common purpose and common interests as Canadians; that all of us are able to say with pride and say with meaning: 'I am a Canadian citizen'."

krg_can.26.d: "The Germans have unlocked the power of the atom and created a weapon for to harness it, a weapon which eclipses all other weapons. They have used it already, ruining the historical English city and harbour of Portsmouth. If the Germans remain the only power to have such weaponry, we will never stand a chance against them.\n\nThus we need to also pursue the Atom ourselves, so that we may harness it's immense power for ourselves, and put an end to the Kaiser's nuclear dominance."

krg_can.27.t: "Uranium from Port Radium"
krg_can.27.d: "Port Radium is an isolated mining area on the east side of the Great Bear Lake, in the far north of the Northwest Territories. Here, isolated from the world and the rest of Canada, lies Eldorado mine, where miners work digging up silver. However, the mine also has vast reserves of the uranium required for creating an atomic bomb.\n\nExpanding the mine is a requirement to expand our supply of uranium and continue our atomic program, and we can benefit from the increased silver production while we are at it!"

krg_can.28.d: "The Germans are sitting on their throne, built on atomic secrets. We are making progress on our own bomb but to expedite the process we may find it worthwhile to steal what they know.\n\nWhile incredibly dangerous, we will send out the best spies we have at our disposal in order to keep this operation concealed. This information could be vital to our program. We must come back with the wealth of information that the Germans have over us."

krg_can.29.d: "Our agents in Germany have done it. They have successfully infiltrated the Kaiser's nuclear program and have the first batch of vital information needed to "quicken the bomb". With their brave work, we now know for sure that Canada will shatter the German nuclear monopoly. We will keep our agents in place for now in order to gather intelligence on any more innovations the aloof Germans are interested in before our discreet exit."

krg_can.30.d: "We should have been patient! Our agents and their spying ring has been caught red handed by German police. Despite their best efforts, it was simply not enough to evade the German intelligence service.The Kaiser has condemned us for our actions and is willing to execute our agents.\n\nAlthough we were able acquire some information from the German nuclear program, it won't be enough to hasten our first bomb. We will now have to save face."

krg_can.31.t: "Finding New Sources"
krg_can.31.d: "According to recent geological surveys undertaken by the University of Toronto, there is a surplus of Uranium in the northern Ontarian Shield. Using it would bolster our stock of uranium not just for warheads, but also for power. Problems arise as the area is supposedly a vulnerable ecosystem that mining could degenerate. Still, for the sake of the nation and the free world, we must tap this resource."

krg_can.32.t: "Training our own scientists"
krg_can.32.d: "It should go without saying that we have some of the scientific brightest minds in the world. Combine that with our world class institutions and our political resolve, we should be able to create the domestic talent for nuclear research. Many existing academics are working on our program but there still should be room to expand it. So why not begin?"
krg_can.32.a: "Absolutely"

krg_can.33.t: "Allied Sources"
krg_can.33.d: "It's no secret that the Entente is full of large underpopulated countries whose lands are immensely resource rich. This includes the green gold itself, uranium. Brokering trade deals between our allies who have large, untapped reserves of uranium would not only be a boon for us, but for them as well."
krg_can.33.a: "Money to be made people"

krg_can.34.t: "Where to test?"
krg_can.34.d: "Now that we have successfully built our own atomic bomb, we need a location to test it. Four locations have been proposed, each with their own benefits.\n\nThe first proposed location is the largely uninhabited Baffin Island in the Arctic Circle. Testing on Baffin would allow greater secrecy surrounding the test if it goes badly, as it would be conducted on Canadian land without anyone around. In stark contrast to the secrecy of Baffin is the Sahara Desert. Right in Germany's backyard, the Sahara allows us the opportunity to work with the French as well as make the detonation a large event.\n\nWe could also test futher east, in Australasian territory. Doing so would allow us to dissaude Japan from a potential attack, as well as sharing some of our nuclear discoveries with the Australasians."

Detonation of the bomb yesterday went without a hitch, and resulted in an explosion estimated to be greater in power than the Heimdallr bomb detonated over Portsmouth.\n\nA press conference is scheduled for later in the day, where we will present our findings to the world press who have already been asking questions thanks to seismic readings showing a shockwave characteristic of a nuclear blast coming from our territory."

krg_can.36.d: "Yesterday, the Canadian and South French government confirmed the testing of a Canadian nuclear warhead in the Sahara desert. The two governments also have announced collaboration together on a future Republic of France nuclear program. The news comes after rumors were swirling around about a large explosion which was spotted by a small village close to the testing site. During the press conference, the German government released a statement which decries the testing of the nuclear weapon by the two nations. Germany of course already has nuclear weapons, as displayed when they nuked the South English port of Portsmouth in the eve of the second weltkrieg. Back to the accusations, the German government has issued two of them. The first of the two Accusations is that the two countries are destabilizing the fragile peace between the Reichspakt and the Entente. Second is that the Canadian government stole Germany's knowledge of nuclear weaponry to create their nuclear weapon. The two governments have both issued statements decrying the german accusations as "unfounded" and "childish". Some of the public have felt the same way about the accusations. "The filthy krauts are just mad they no longer hold the keys to the kingdom in which they were holding the world hostage with." said a woman who attended the press conference in Marseille Yesterday.

krg_can.37.d: "Yesterday, the two close allies announced and confirmed recent nuclear testing in the Pacific ocean of Canada's first nuclear bomb. This comes after a few days of rumor of the origin of what was then a mysterious explosion in the Pacific. Many had already theorized that the explosion was a nuclear test, but now the two governments have confirmed that the explosion was indeed a test of a nuclear warhead. This isn't the first nuclear warhead either, the Germans famously used their bomb in the eve of the Second Weltkrieg in the south English port of Portsmouth. The Japanese government has denounced the attack as imperialist war mongering threatening peace in the pacific region. The German government has also denounced the test and has accused Canada of hurting the fragile peace and of stealing German nuclear secrets. The two governments later in the day yesterday have denounced the accusation and the denouncement as nothing short of Childish. Many in the public have also shared that sentiment. "The filthy krauts are just mad because they can't act like the rulers of the world now that another power has the bomb!" said one man near the press conference in Canberra, the capital, yesterday. Germany isn't the only power to showcase concern however. It is important to note that no matter what happens, it is important to note that the world has turned to a new chapter.\n\nCBC news, Canberra"

krg_can.38.d: "Canadian and Australasian officials have confirmed the mysterious explosion in Southern Australia, which was theorized by the public to be a nuclear weapon test, was indeed a test of a Canadian nuclear warhead. They announced it so early the previous day. The confirmation of the test hasn't gone unnoticed by the outside world. The German empire has issued a denouncement of both the Australasian government and the Canadian government. There are two reasons behind the recent denouncements. The first reason is that the test hurts the fragile peace that is currently holding the war. The other has the world descends into a cold war suitably named the Kalterkrieg, named after Mackinze King's famous mispronunciation of the German word for Cold war.. The second reason is that the German government has accused the Canadian government of stealing their state secrets to build the bomb in the first place. The two governments have denounced the denouncement, stating paranoid and childish behaviour on the behalf of the german government. "The damned krauts are only denouncing the test because they are scared that someone else has the bomb and they can't rule the world like it's there's." Stated one person yesterday in Canberra. However many Australians have also voiced their disagreements with the test. The aboriginal peoples of course dismay the destruction of sacred land while others are dismayed at the bushfires which recent enveloped a small mining village in the outback. A nuclear weapon infamously was dropped on the south English city port of Portsmouth in the dying days of the Second Weltkrieg by German forces.\n\nCBC news, Canberra"

krg_can.39.d: "A full year, almost to the day, after the exploratory survey had been made to determine that it would be possible, Stratford forged its long promised theatrical link with its more celebrated namesake across the ocean last night. In a handsome tent theatre on the banks of the Avon river - in a town littered affectionately with Shakespearean names and Shakespearean allusions - a staunch group of men and women who clung doggedly to the notion that the favourite son of England's Stratford could be as highly honoured through his own plays in Ontario as in Warwickshire, saw the fulfillment of their years of hopes. Alec Guinness blew critics' minds away with his stellar performance as Richard III in the production of the same name. It should go without saying that the play's opening lines – "Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York" – will mark the beginning of an astonishing new chapter in Canadian theatre."

krg_can.40.t: "Maurice Richard Riots Cause Havoc!"
krg_can.40.d: "Today, the Montreal Canadiens star player Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard was suspended for the remainder of the hockey season following his fight with a linesman on the opposing team. This decision led to unrest from a large portion of French Canadians who believed it was another example of the NHL favouring English Canadians over their French-speaking compatriots. In an ill-fated attempt to smooth over relations, the NHL commissioner attended the Canadiens next game, which ultimately failed. Over 10,000 protestors took to the streets in anger over his suspension and general discrimination against Quebecois. While a thousands-strong riot is never good, the issue here lies not with anger over hockey rules, but rather general Quebecois unrest. Many of our policy experts are claiming that this could be a catalyst for further anti-English sentiment in French Canada, and potentially even violent resistance. If we do not wish to have a national crisis on our hands, we must choose our next moves very carefully."

krg_can.41.t: "The New Wave of British Immigrants"
krg_can.41.d: "\"By golly, there's no snow!\" said an Englishman as he stepped off the boat in Montreal. Perhaps he was joking. The ship bringing him from England had enjoyed warm July weather as it sailed up the St. Lawrence River. But the Englishman was heading for Elliot Lake, Ontario, where winters were cruel against the unprepared. He had been warned about the winters when applying for the job at one of many new recruitment offices funded by the Government of Canada. This man was one of the many British immigrants who are pouring into Canada after the Reclamation War.\n\nLast year, more immigrants arrived from the British Isles than from anywhere else. Even with the increasing egalitarian changes to immigration law, governmental policies have favoured French and British immigrants over other people because of shared tradition and language. Over 100,000 Britons arrived on Canada shores last year, a 15% increase from the year earlier, with forecasts anticipating another 120,000 to arrive this year. The influx of British immigrants comes at a time when many Britons who came in the 1920s are returning to their homeland.\n\nAs the many aristocrats who stayed in Canada leave to re-establish their presence in the much destroyed Isles, many middle and lower class Brits, scarred with recent memories of loss, violence, and nuclear destruction, are leaving their old lives behind to start anew in the prospering but people needing Canada. "As quaintly American it is to say," a newly arrived Scotsman exclaimed, \"Canada is the new land of opportunity.\""

krg_can.42.d: "Today, famed Second Weltkrieg Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery returned to Canada for the Liberation Day celebrations in Ottawa after successfully overseeing the transition of power from the Canadian Army to the newly-formed British National Government.\n\nMontgomery's first stop was at the Governor General's residence at Rideau Hall where he met with His Excellency and the Prime Minister to discuss the new balance of power in Europe. Afterwards, Montgomery made a special address to the House of Commons with the Governor General and Prime Minister in attendance.\n\nIn his address, Montgomery emphasized the levels of devastation and poverty afflicting Europe and stressed that it was imperative that the Canadian government launch a dramatic economic intervention program as soon as possible. Montgomery closed his address by succinctly stating that: "If we are to win the peace in Europe then we must wage war aggressively against poverty and starvation, lest we allow all of Europe to fall into the waiting hands of the Kaiser or worse yet, a repeat of the events of 1925.""

krg_can.43.d: "Breaking news out of Ottawa today. With mounting pressure from both the public and our allies abroad, the Foreign Minister Mr. Lester Pearson and the Liberal Government have presented a new bill to the House of Commons. In his bill, Mr. Pearson has outlined an ambitious plan for the reorganization of the Imperial Economic Development Corporation to manage the  allocation of economic aid to our valiant allies in Europe. Unfortunately, the ongoing debates have revealed new divisions between the factions within the Government and the Opposition. The moderate and hardline \"Laurierists\" and the \"Commonwealthists\" are divided on the issues of funding, repayment, and allocation of aid. While more conservative elements in parliament have opposed the plan altogether. Most notable of all however, is the split between the traditional Commonwealthists and the new internationalist \"Ententists\". The choices made in these debates may have repercussions for years to come."
krg_can.43.a: "Squabbling politicians, great."

krg_can.44.t: "Bill C-22 - Funding"
krg_can.44.d: "One point of contention within Parliament is the amount of funding we should allocate towards European Reconstruction. While a considerable amount of aid will be in the form of goods and food, the issue of financial aid remains. Internationalist MPs are arguing that a project of this scale needs to be as fully funded as possible in order to effectively jumpstart the economies of a large section of Europe. More fiscally-conservative MPs argue that it would be more prudent to keep financial aid to Europe to a reasonable minimum and focus on expanding our own industrial and military base."
krg_can.44.a: "Large amounts of funding will do."
krg_can.44.b: "We can't afford a large gamble!"
krg_can.44.c: "Compromise is the only option."

krg_can.45.t: "Bill C-22 - Repayment"
krg_can.45.d: "Another issue that has risen is the issue of repayment. A contentious debate has started on whether our financial aid should primarily be sent in the form of temporary loans or through generous grants.\n\nOne Conservative MP argued that: \"It would be madness to shovel money and capital into Europe without a firm repayment plan.\" A Liberal MP responded sardonically that: \"Pushing for a repayment program at this time would be ridiculous since there is no reliable conversion rate between scorched earth and the Canadian dollar.\" Perhaps it would be wiser to tacitly encourage our friends in Europe to purchase from Canadian firms."
krg_can.45.a: "We can't throw our money away in Europe."
krg_can.45.b: "One cannot put a price on a grateful ally... or a new market for our goods."

krg_can.46.t: "Bill C-22 - Recipients"
krg_can.46.d: "While obviously our aid will mainly be focused on our friends in the Entente, some internationalist elements in Parliament have raised the notion of also inviting countries that remained unaligned during the Second Weltkrieg to reconstruction discussions. The internationalista argue that this would place these unaligned in our sphere of influence and endearing ourselves to their people as the Kalterkrieg marches on."

With the framework in place for the reformed Crown Corporation and a clear mandate from parliament, this reconstruction project is shaping up to be one of the largest foreign investment missions in history. Already invitations are being sent out for a Conference on European Recovery in Lisbon. With considerable bipartisan support in the House of Commons, the task now falls onto the European nations to organize and present their national recovery programs. Some other issues expected to be brought up are the issues of free trade, liberalization, and French reunification. The media has already begun calling this ambitious and unprecedented plan the "Montgomery Plan" after the man who inspired it, Field Marshal Montgomery himself."

krg_can.48.d: "A disappointing moment for the Liberal Government today in the House of Commons. Despite the extensive efforts to garner support for the Montgomery Plan, it would appear their efforts were in vain as the Bill was narrowly defeated in the parliamentary vote after days of negotiations. While undoubtedly a low point for the Liberals as they are now vulnerable to a Vote of No Confidence from the Opposition in the House, many are uncertain of the consequences of the Bill's defeat for Western Europe."

Prime Minister King has decided to expand the Foreign Office, and reopen Canada to the rest of the world.\n\nOnly one question remained on King's mind: How would Canada interact with the rest of the world? With the ruthless Germans already kicking down democracies across the world, the question cannot wait for long.\n\nCanada has two options: the Aggressive route, where Canada does as she pleases to stop German authoritarianism from spreading, and a Balanced approach to minimise world tension while still proactively advancing our agenda, including through subtle and covert means.\n\nEventually, King decides that..."

The members of the ruling class who weren't caught and hanged quickly fled to Canada, the Empire's most loyal Dominion. The Lords from the House of Lords soon invaded the Canadian government, disrupting the Senate to no end.\n\nToday, these Lords are going home.\n\nWith the Birthright taken from the Syndicalist Menace, these men no longer need to reside in the government of Canada. The boats and planes are arriving to take these men to their home, so our Canadian home can be governed by our own people. Already, rallies for support and the dream of an All-Canadian government  have reached our people, and they rejoice.\n\nThe real question is now, is whether to return to the old Senate system or to do something new.

In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, sections of the former West Indies have been jointly occupied by the Royal Canadian Navy since 1942.\n\nWhile the islands have maintained de jure independence, in reality they remain under the military administration of the Royal Canadian Navy's \"Provisional Government for the West Indies\". With the end of the Second Weltkrieg and demobilization looming, there have been mounting calls to finally withdraw the garrison from the Caribbean and to end the \"friendly occupation\" of what was once an allied nation.

krg_can.55.d: "Today, local representatives from the Islands of Barbados, Bahamas, Bermuda, the British Leeward Islands, and the British Windward Islands presented a petition to the Interim Government for the West Indies requesting for formal admission into the Canadian Confederation. Interestingly, this marks the third proposed expansion of Canadian Confederation of the 20th Century since the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905 and the incorporation of the Dominion of Newfoundland in 1926. \n\n However, such a motion remains a divisive subject in Parliament. Incorporating the islands would require both substantial economic and institutional support from the federal government until they are able to feasibly support themselves. Furthermore, there is the question of how much power should be granted to the islands. Should they be granted the autonomy of a province or should they be made into territories with the federal government maintaining tight control over internal affairs such as taxation? Then again, there is nothing legally binding about the petition. We could always go with the status-quo that has served well up until now."

After months of petitioning the government, activists in the currently occupied Caribbean territories have a chance of getting representation in government. The Canadian Caribbean act comes to a vote this month after weeks of drafting. The act proposed by Member of Parliament Jack Smith representing York North would see it that the territories would become provinces within Canada. One of the first expansions of Canadian territory since the annexation of the dominion of Newfoundland in 1926. \n\n Of course the act isn't guaranteed to pass as it is radical. Some prominent members of parliament are arguing to designate the islands as territories rather than provinces. Other, more conservative members, are arguing to keep the status quo.

However, with the traditional liberal powers of Europe disjointed and still reeling from the devastation of the Second Weltkrieg, none seem likely to be in a position to resist German domination alone.  \n\n The usefulness of vague Ententes and mere promises of cooperation has passed.

krg_can.72.d: "The prime minister has recently been approached by two factions originating from the Canadian Caribbean. \n\n One faction is a group of wealthy white business men who seek to turn the Caribbean into a paradise of tourism. With the beautiful beaches, strong Canadian economy, beautiful vistas and nature, it's no secret that already with minimum attention they've bloomed into major tourism destinations. The business men seek to have the support of the federal government to make this even more of a destination. \n\n The other faction is a group is a group of local Caribbean industrialists who seek to build strong economies on the islands to lift the islands out of poverty and build a strong economy not reliant on the vists of foreigners. This group seems to mostly be focused on getting government support to set up and strengthen various small industries along all the islands. \n\n The business men has stronger support from mainland Canada and many of the wealthy elite in Canada, but the local industrialists have very strong support in the Caribbean itself. Either way both ways would see a stronger economy on these islands."

# krg_can.73.d: "Half a decade after the Canadian government decided to support a group of business men in making the Canadian Caribbean a toursit destination to be envied, the local industrials approach the government once more. While a focus on the tourism industry has seen them succeed in industries such as souvenirs and other related objects, however income inequality has risen in the area with poverty being pushed aside rather then fixed, with it increasingly heavily during the off-season. While the industrialists support the current tourist industry, they are asking for the Canadian government to make the the Caribbean economy more multi-faceted by asking to the government to support a business grant for one of the four Canadian Caribbean regions."

Together they are pitching mass funding as so the Canadian Caribbean can meat it's tourism mecca expectations. While economic growth in the region has grown fast since the Canadian government supported the local industry, it has remained relatively slow to the rest of Canada. So now both parties are asking for grants for a massive, mostly, untapped tourism industry which could see economic growth in the Caribbean economy in line with the other regions of Canada. Of course, with the caveat with mostly supporting local Caribbean tourism entrepreneurs from each of the four regions competing for a government grant."

krg_can.75.d: "Prime Minister Mackenzie King visited the Midwestern city of Detroit today, to little fanfare. Detroit is still recovering from the devastating Second American Civil War, where many factories and homes are being repaired and rebuilt. And as the Great Lakes Government is still mainly recognized as a Canadian puppet state, most of its citizens pay little respect to Canadian visitors. However, the audience for the Prime Minister's speech still constituted a full crowd, and the crowd was polite, despite King's message being generally regarded in Detroit newspapers as \"bland.\" In the very least it caused little controversy, as King mostly spoke about the benefits of the government's restored democracy, and Canadian efforts in rebuilding Detroit and the Great Lakes region as a whole.\n\nAn event after the speech, however, would get much more coverage from the media, as the Prime Minister's dog, Pat III, who was brought along for the trip, was kidnapped just after the Prime Minister had finished his speech. This reportedly caused much distress for the Prime Minister, although happily the two were reunited after the dog was found wandering around Woodward Avenue unharmed, just a few hours later."

For many dockworkers and native Halifaxers, the scene harkened back memories of the first British Exile in 1925. However, these newcomers rather than being displaced aristocrats and landowners, seek to become fullfledged Canadian citizens after witnessing the current state of their liberated homeland. It would appear the scars of syndicalist rule in Britain run deeper than previously imagined."

Today, shortly after the arrival of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, the Member of Parliament from Saskatchewan Mr. M.J. Coldwell led his colleagues in a walkout from the parliamentary chamber. When asked for comment Mr. Coldwell stated the position of his party as such: \"We have reached a point where our words are no longer able to get through to the Prime Minister or his cabinet. It is regrettable that the party now must resort to such measures in order to express the outrage of our constituents\". Despite the new absence of the CCF in Parliament and the Liberals having yet to react, Coldwell's gamble alone has brought the future of the Conservative government into question."

The visit marks a departure from the longstanding policy of diplomatic isolation by the Entente after the collapse of British authority in the region in 1939. St. Laurent and his staff were greeted by Indian Premier Nehru upon their arrival before embarking on a tour of the historic city. Despite an initial tense meeting, the visit remained cordial between the two men. On the topic of future relations, one diplomat remarked: \"An Accord-aligned India would be ideal, an acquiescent India acceptable, and a Reichspakt-aligned India disastrous.\" Whether or not the visit marks the beginning of a detente between India and the rest of the Accord remains to be seen."

They endure in our politics, in the hearts and minds of Canadians everywhere, and in the very fabric of our society as Canada once again finds itself at the forefront of international affairs.\n\nSafeguarded by the vast Atlantic and the valiant Royal Navy, Canada was spared as the democracies of Europe fell to syndicalist revolutionaries and opportunistic autocrats and the continent tore itself apart in yet another Weltkrieg. Canada now possesses many benefits other nations dream of or exist solely in the minds of a lost generation. Canada is a country of stable economic growth and once inconceivable scientific advances along with the old hallowed principles of peace, order, and good government. It is only natural for Canada to become the Beacon of Liberty in a dark world increasingly dominated by the German Empire.\n\nWhat is it that has led to this moment? Is it fate? Is it fortune? An act of deliverance? It matters not how we have reached this instant. Despite Laurier's aspirations faltering under the strains of war and German oppression. It shall not be the destiny of the Canadian people to wallow in the German shadow. History has shown that empires can be toppled. It has happened before, it can happen again. A chance has been offered and it must be seized, with all the strength we can muster. For the 20th Century shall be the Canadian Century."

krg_can.85.d: "Early this morning, at a meeting of party members, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, more coloquially known as the CCF, voted on and passed a rebranding plan for the party. The most notable change that this rebranding plan entails is a change in name to the New Democratic Party.\n\nThis move was spearheaded by Tommy Douglas, an influential party member widely believed to be the inevitable successor to M.J Coldwell, the party's current leader. Douglas has touted these changes as a way to reinvent the party and move on from the past. More cynical commentators have described the plan as a way to obscure the CCF's more radical history in politics and their past associations with syndicalist figures.\n\nOnly time will tell if the CCF, now the NDP, will need more than a name change to win Canadian hearts and minds."

krg_can.86.t: "Progressive Conservatives Formed"
krg_can.86.d: "Ever since the ascendancy of Mackenzie King to the role of Prime Minister, the Liberal Party of Canada has largely remained united. No more. The last few weeks have seen tensions within the Liberal Party reach a tipping point, splitting the party in two.\n\nIn a press conference sure to be written into the history books, leader of the conservative wing of the Liberals, John Diefenbaker, announced the formation of the Progressive Conservative Party, with himself as it's first leader. He was soon followed by many members of the conservative wing, shrinking the Liberals presence in parliament.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Conservative Party collapsed. Split over their differences over economics and willingness to compromise, the "hard tories" started to find a new home with the unionists. Soon after, many "soft tories", already being favorable towards some of Diefenbaker's ideas, began to join the ranks of the Progressive Conservatives.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this new party shall work with their now former colleagues in the Liberal Party and Unionist Party and, perhaps more importantly, if they can defend their seats in the next general election."

The plans, which included the implementation of eugenics-based policies, were met with widespread backlash and outrage from the public and other political parties.\n\nDouglas, who has long been an advocate for universal healthcare, was forced to retreat from his position and apologize for the policies, which were seen as unethical and discriminatory. \"I deeply regret the harm and offense that these proposals have caused,\" he said. \"I take full responsibility for my actions and will work to make amends.\"\n\nThe incident has had a significant impact on the popularity of the NDP, which has seen a drop in support nationwide in the wake of the controversy. Many Canadians, who had previously seen the party as a champion of social justice and equality, are now questioning its values and priorities.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the incident will impact the party's chances in the next Federal Elections and how it will handle the crisis going forward."

krg_can.88.d: "Lately, Prime Minister Bennett has been facing a difficult decision with regards to the Canadian aristocracy: should the government collaborate with the aristrocracy or shall it seek to oppose them?\n\nOn one hand, we could choose to work with the aristocracy and implement favorable policies towards them in order to increase our own political power and that of the Unionist Party. However, this approach could also risk alienating ordinary Canadians and reducing support for the party among the general public.\n\nOn the other hand, we could choose to fight against the aristocracy and embrace a more populist approach, highlighting issues such as economic inequality and the need for greater representation for ordinary Canadians. This approach could help to increase support for the party among the general public, but could also risk alienating powerful figures within the aristocracy and potentially harm our government's stability."

Critics and members of other parties immediately jumped on the move, accusing Bennett of trying to suppress opposing parties and create a dictatorship akin to the German Empire.\n\nUltimately, thanks to the near universal backlash against his move, Bennett was forced to backtrack, revoking his declaration. However, the move does seem to have damaged the CCF on the margins, as some moderate politicians are now more afraid to openly associate with the party."

This fact combined with unusually high rainfall just prior to Hazel led to water levels in the province rising as much as 8 Meters. Communities along the Humber River in particular saw the most damage, as earthen dams failed and whole towns became submerged. When the storm finally dissipated, 81 were dead and whole communities were left homeless, with countless injured.

In the case of a detection of an incoming ICBM attack, these bunkers can be opened and house key government and military officials so we may be able to continue the governance of our nation following an attack. Top officials of our government who have been informed of this plan are dubbing the bunkers 'Diefenbunkers' after the Prime Minister's involvement in this project.

However, they are not calling for an end of the Entente, but a renovation into an alliance for a new age, an accord of nations which will pledge to defend liberty, and each other.

However, the German Empire, our former ally in the war, is also trying to reassert its hegemony over the world. It is a necessity that all free countries oppose German dominance, in an effort to preserve a fair world for all.\n\nThus, voices proposing the need for an \"Accord,\" to unite the free, democratic countries of the world are getting louder. We prevented the syndicalist attempt at world hegemony, and we must prevent the German attempt as well."

krg_can.94.d: "With Europe devastated by an almost decade long war, the European powers in the Entente are not in a very good position to stand up to Germany if the situation were to require it. British and French officials know that they are not ready for war, and their economies are not ready to compete with Germany either.\n\nCanada's \"Montgomery Plan\" has already begun to fund European reconstruction efforts, but a greater level of cooperation is going to be needed if the United Kingdom and France are going to be able to compete economically and militarily with Germany. Proponents of the Accord have voices in almost every Entente nation now, and with much more benefits of a stronger alliance easily visible, it appears as if the formation of the  Accord in the near future is inevitable."

Many things are on the table for discussion, and a lot of issues have to be ironed out before a unanimous consensus can be reached. However, there is no doubt that the discussions will end in the creation of the Accord, a new alliance to compete against Germany and pool together the strength of the world to oppose the Kaiser's hegemony."

krg_can.96.t: "The America Situation"
krg_can.96.d: "First to be discussed is the overall situation in the former United States. Since outright war and hostilities ended years ago, the former country has been divided into four governments: the Pacific States, the American Union State, the Great Lakes Government, and New England. The Great Lakes Government remains occupied by Canadian forces, and New England is a major leader of our alliance. That leaves the Pacific States and the American Union State outside of the future Accord.\n\nHowever, the Pacific States are cordial to our alliance, although it is unlikely that they will join the Accord in the future. That leaves the main threat in the Americas as the American Union State, a one-party \"democracy\" that is outwardly friendly to Germany. While efforts have been made to isolate this regime, it seems as if the Accord will have to live with this threat into the near future.\n\nStill, there are worries that a third civil war could break out if tensions reach a breaking point, and if they do, it could be necessary for the Accord to use its military power to assist fellow members in that event. After discussion concluded, it appears as if the Accord has confirmed among itself that the American Union State will be contained, and our friends in the Americas will be protected, no matter the cost."
krg_can.96.a: "Hopefully we will be ready if the time comes."

krg_can.97.t: "Military Cooperation"
krg_can.97.d: "With the discussion of the threat in the Americas over, it seemed necessary to move on to the amount of military cooperation within the Accord. It is obvious to everyone that the Accord is primarily a defensive military alliance. Thus the delegates first moved to draft articles specifying when a nation should call on the Accord for defense, and how other nations in the Accord should react.\n\nA general Accord command structure was also created, to help unify the Accord's military in the case of another European war. All delegates agree that cooperation is the key to success in the case of another theoretical global war.\n\nFinally, all nations agreed on requiring a 2% minimum of a nation's GDP to be put towards defense, however there is no punishment for a country in the Accord that does not follow this rule. Still, there is little doubt that all nations in the Accord will take defense seriously"
krg_can.97.a: "The militaries of the Accord stand united!"

krg_can.98.t: "The Status of the Colonies"
krg_can.98.d: "After military requirements were drafted, a few of the delegates brought up the issues of colonial holdings, and if they should be under the defense of the entire Accord. This began a great deal of conflict between the New England delegates and French delegates, and started to derail the discussions at large.\n\nA solution came from the Canadian delegation, which drafted an article that was ambiguous and vague, defining colonies as \"overseas holdings\" and not truly specifying if they were to be defended or not. While this seems to just be pushing the issue down the road, both parties have at least stopped arguing with each other, although grumblings could still be heard."
krg_can.98.a: "At least we reached some sort of consensus."

krg_can.99.t: "Smaller Countries Want Representation"
krg_can.99.d: "With the documents having nearly been finalized, regional powers such as Australasia and Portugal have brought up their own complaints, mainly about their representation in the Accord. They want more power in the decision-making of the alliance, like where the Accord puts its resources and how the Accord may grow in the future. At a point it seemed like many delegates would not sign the document unless a system of representation was added, and the Canadians folded, drafting an unprecedented system for a military alliance, a formal voting system.\n\nThis voting system will allow for delegates from every Accord nation, small or large, to vote on whatever issues are brought up. However, it's obvious that nations such as Canada and New England will still have considerably more power within this system, however it is a compromise that seemingly leaves every delegate happy. This voting system goes to show how the Accord is a new kind of alliance, a democratic alliance of democracies united under the common goal of liberty for all."

St. Laurent has instead called for elections in order to resolve this crisis by electing a new Prime Minister to lead the government until the next round of elections in 1953.\n\nWhile this represents a major setback for Governor-General Windsor's efforts at appointing a Prime Minister that can unite the nation, that does not mean that he is out of options.

As a result of this split, Diefenbaker now controls a sizable wing of Parliament encompassing both former Liberal Party and Conservative Party members.\n\nThough some may have expected nearly all members of the Liberal Party to hold a grudge against Diefenbaker for such a move, it seems that there may be enough Liberal MPs sympathetic to Diefenbaker that a coalition government may be able to form.

In response to this, Diefenbaker has promised to appoint Stuart Garson as Minister of the Interior, and Jean Lesage to the position of Minister of Justice and Attorney General.\n\nThese promises of power have successfully convinced the rest of the Liberal Party to support the new Diefenbaker government, which now is poised to be an unstoppable force in parliament."

Diefenbaker's high profile split with the Liberals in 1950 seems to have created deep antipathy among Liberal members. One member described the offer as \"outrageous\" and declared that Diefenbaker \"should have just stayed with the party in the first place\".\n\nThough a great setback for Diefenbaker, rejection by the Liberals does not necessarily spell the end of his ambitions to lead the nation through the present crisis.

Many have speculated that the King's choice of McNaughton is an attempt to try and appease the Canadian public and save the monarchy from further delegitimization within Canada.\n\n Regardless of his motive, the ramifications of the King's decision are clear.

As this has occured, counter protestors have retreated nearly entirely, leaving the streets empty of supporters of the government.\n\nBennett's government is also showing signs of weakness, with multiple cabinet ministers threatening to leave the party entirely if they cannot win in the upcoming election. Increasingly though, losing almost seems like a certainty as polls show the CCF opening up a massive lead over all other parties."
krg_can_crisis.39.a: "Well, not much we can do now..."

krg_can_crisis.40.t: "CCF Landslide!"
krg_can_crisis.40.d: "Results from the recent snap election called by W.A.C Bennett's Unionist government have come in and the results are nothing but incredible. Former Prime Minister M.J Coldwell's CCF have managed to capture a large majority of seats, getting an amount of votes not seen since the middle of the second Weltkrieg when Mackenzie King's popularity rested at an all-time high.\n\nThis election victory, which many have suggested was perhaps inevitable after the Victoria Massacre, has seemingly emboldened the CCF to push for their most radical policies. Already, the Governor-General Powers Act has been pushed through parliament and a referendum on the monarchy has been called, with advocates within the CCF calling for abolishing the monarchy altogether. It remains to be seen whether or not Canadians will agree with them, but the CCF has once again caused a political earthquake."
krg_can_crisis.40.a: "The power of the people is absolute."

krg_can_crisis.41.t: "Police Defuse Protests"
krg_can_crisis.41.d: "Recent violence in our cities related to protests by the CCF has been successfully quelled by the increased police presence ordered in by the government. Though stiff resistance was faced from some more radical protestors, the vast majority of protestors seemed to respect and even be appreciative of the increased police presence, as it ensured that their voice was not silenced through violence.\n\nNow, the remaining days until election day seem as if they will be characterized by peace instead of being subsumed by the chaos that seemed inevitable only days ago. Members of the government have received private words of approval for their response from members across all parties, and even M.J Coldwell himself is rumoured to be pleased."
krg_can_crisis.41.a: "We dodged a bullet."

krg_can_crisis.42.t: "CCF Falls Short"
krg_can_crisis.42.d1: "Results from the snap election called by W.A.C Bennett's Unionist government have come in and they are quite disappointing for the CCF. While they managed to capture a large amount of seats, they have fallen short of a majority.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this would not be an impediment to forming a government, but quite unusually, MPs from across the Liberal Party, Progressive Conservative Party, and the Unionist Party have come together to form a coalition and keep the CCF out of power entirely. This grand coalition, led by John Diefenbaker as Prime Minister, has not yet announced any policy goals, but it can be assumed that they will be significantly less radical than the policy aims of the CCF. Time will tell if this grand coalition will be able to survive, but its formation alone is an extraordinary development."
krg_can_crisis.42.d2: "Results from the snap election called by John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government have come in and they are quite disappointing for the CCF.

krg_can_crisis.42.a: "Shall the politicians let it survive?"

krg_can_crisis.43.t: "Limited Governor-General Powers Act Passes"
krg_can_crisis.43.d: "The grand coalition formed after the recent snap election today took it's first major legislative action. The Governor-General Powers Act, the controversial law that caused a constitutional crisis, was reintroduced into parliament and amended until most of the controversial provisions were removed.\n\nNotable provisions removed include the provisions that limited royal assent and ability to appoint a Prime Minister. Protests against these changes in Parliament were widespread, with most CCF MPs being vocal about their displeasure with the coalition changing this law that they argue is more necessary than ever after the crisis."
krg_can_crisis.43.a: "A new lease on life for the Governor-General."

krg_can_crisis.44.t: "CCF Becomes The NDP"
krg_can_crisis.44.d: "Early this morning, at a meeting of party members, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, more coloquially known as the CCF, voted on and passed a rebranding plan for the party. The most notable change that this rebranding plan entails is a change in name to the New Democratic Party.\n\nThis move was spearheaded by Tommy Douglas, an influential party member widely believed to be the inevitable successor to M.J Coldwell, the party's current leader. Douglas has touted these changes as a way to reinvent the party and move on from the past. More cynical commentators have described the plan as a way to obscure the CCF's more radical history in politics, culminating with the recent constitutional crisis.\n\nOnly time will tell if the CCF, now the NDP, will be able to regain the power in government that they once had before the crisis, or if they will need more than a name change to win Canadian hearts and minds."
krg_can_crisis.44.a: "Can a new acronym bring them back to power?"

krg_can_crisis.45.t: "Governor-General Powers Act Revoked"
#krg_can_crisis.45.d: "Revoke the act, blame the CCF. Unionists proclaimed saviors of democracy.\nThe temporary coalition is revoked with all political rivals one way or another disenfranchised. Unionists get their 1953."
krg_can_crisis.45.d: "The grand coalition formed after the recent snap election today took it's first major legislative action. The Governor-General Powers Act, the controversial law that caused a constitutional crisis, was revoked from consideration by parliament, almost certainly assuring the death of the act and all of it's changes.\n\nProtests against this action from the CCF and far-left members of the Liberal Party, who wanted to see a scaled down act, has been widespread, but it appears that the more conservative parties in the government do not have any appetite to pass any version of the bill.\n\nPublic reaction to the move however has been far less divided. There have been no protests, no widespread public outcry, and no violence. Instead, public reaction has been to heap praise upon the Unionist Party, crediting them with saving Canadian democracy from the CCF. It is starting to become believed that, for the first time, the Unionists may have a shot in the next election."
krg_can_crisis.45.a: "A new lease on life for the Governor-General."

krg_can_crisis.46.t: "St. Laurent Calls for Elections!"
krg_can_crisis.46.d: "Early this afternoon, Liberal Party leader Louis St. Laurent took the stand and, in front of an audience estimated to be around 1000 Liberal Party members, called upon members of both the Liberal Party and Progressive Conservative Party to stand against the Diefenbaker government and announce their support for elections.\n\nThis is a major blow to the Diefenbaker government and a huge change of stance for St. Laurent, who just months ago struck an agreement with Diefenbaker to forge a coalition of both the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. Already, some members of the Liberal Party involved in government have made public ultimatums stating their intention to resign if elections are not held soon. It is rumoured that some Progressive Conservative members of the government have also made such ultimatums in private.\n\nIt appears that Diefenbaker's hand will be successfully forced by St. Laurent, and elections will be held to decide the future of Canada. Time will tell if there will be any future cooperation between Diefenbaker and St. Laurent, however."
krg_can_crisis.46.a: "Two rivals, back at it again."

krg_can_crisis.47.t: "St. Laurent Denounces the Government!"
krg_can_crisis.47.d: "Late this afternoon, in front of a crowd of Liberal Party members, leader of the Liberals Louis St. Laurent launched into a torrent of attacks against the Diefenbaker government. During his speech, St. Laurent accused the Progressive Conservative PM of heading an illegitimate government without the will of the people behind him.\n\nNear the end of his speech, St. Laurent also attacked Diefenbaker for not reaching out to any of the other parties in Parliament to create a coalitional national government. Finally, St. Laurent called for elections to let the people resolve the issue of who should lead the country out of this crisis, a demand which many in not only the Liberal Party but also the Progressive Conservative Party seem sympathetic to."
krg_can_crisis.47.a: "Two rivals, back at it again."

krg_can_crisis.48.t: "Diefenbaker Responds to St. Laurent"
krg_can_crisis.48.d: "Speaking to reporters today in Ottawa, John Diefenbaker took a moment to respond to some of the allegations levied against his government by Louis St. Laurent a few short days ago. In his remarks, Diefenbaker invoked an old grievance from the days in which he was a member of the Liberal Party, using it to accuse St. Laurent of being power hungry.\n\nThough he struck a firey tone against St. Laurent, when asked about the possibility of elections in the near future, Diefenbaker was more moderate than he was only days ago. Instead of refusing to hold elections outright, Diefenbaker seemed open to the possibility pending \"further discussion\" with members of his government."
krg_can_crisis.48.a: "What a raucous campaign already!"

krg_can_crisis.49.t: "Diefenbaker Calls Elections"
krg_can_crisis.49.d: "John Diefenbaker, after consultation with members of his government, today announced snap elections shall be held in order to solve what he diplomatically referred to as a \"constitutional issue\" regarding the current government. This decision is believed have to come only after significant pressure from within Diefenbaker's own government following Louis St. Laurent's public denunciation of the government.\n\nReaction from across the political spectrum has generally been positive, with St. Laurent himself praising the move and the CCF starting up their campaign operation in anticipation of an intense election. Such a prediction by the CCF may prove exceedingly wise, as it seems as if this election will decide the political future of not only Canada, but perhaps the role of the monarchy as well."
krg_can_crisis.49.a: "Schedule elections relatively soon"
krg_can_crisis.49.b: "Schedule elections very soon"

krg_can_crisis.50.t: "CCF Criticized for Protest Activity"
krg_can_crisis.50.d: "Throughout the country, campaigns from all the major parties have been working around the clock in anticipation of the elections just two short weeks away. Nestled within the massive campaign apparatus of the CCF however, the so-called \"Public Demonstration Division\" has created a storm of media activity as of recent.\n\nCharged with organizing CCF protests as well as supporting worker strikes, the Public Demonstation Division has recently found itself in the spotlight as the Progressive Conservatives have attempted to use it as a way to undermine the CCF's credibility as a major political party.\n\nLeader of the Progressive Conservatives, John Diefenbaker, has railed against the division, calling it a \"Public Disruption Division\" and arguing that a party with such a dangerous arm can under no circumstances be allowed back into control of government fucntions. So far, most CCF operatives have dismissed these criticisms as minor, but some believe that Diefenbaker may know something that they don't, and they may be in for troube come election day."
krg_can_crisis.50.a: "Just standard political fodder!"

krg_can_crisis.51.t: "The March on Ottawa"
krg_can_crisis.51.d: "For the last 2 days, Ottawa has been paralyzed by a massive public demonstration organized by the CCF itself. Trucks cannot get to businesses to drop off supplies, citizens cannot get to work, and government buildings are surrounded by chanting protestors constantly.\n\nWhile so far most demonstrators have been peaceful, some members within our government worry that if we allow this protest to continue, it could turn into an occupation of the city and the end of the government itself. A group of MPs from the old Conservative Party have also made it known that they believe unless the protest is put down, democracy in Canada will end as we know it and a Syndicalist governent shall be installed in its place.\n\nThe hardliners advocate for us to send the military in and forcefully break up the protest, though the risk of civilian casualties in such an operation is high. The more moderate members of the government believe that the best course of action is to let the protest continue and eventually die out as protestors get tired and go home."

###Patriation Events
krg_can_patriation.1.t: "Edward and Eden Arrive in Canada"
krg_can_patriation.1.d: "King Edward VIII and Prime Minister Anthony Eden have arrived in Canada today, traveling back from the UK. After the restoration of the United Kingdom, Edward and Eden have been spending much of their time restoring order and stability to Britain. Now, however, they have arrived to discuss the future of Canada, and Canada's request for patriation. As Canada's and the United Kingdom's relationship has transformed dramatically, many were expecting for this moment to come. Still, negotiations are up in the air as demands and concessions may have to be met from both the British and Provincial governments, to ensure a neat and tidy Patriation occurs. Hopefully, however, no party will get in the way of a clean patriation process. The fact that negotiations are mostly being held in secrecy at this point should hopefully not backfire on us, either."
krg_can_patriation.1.a: "Let's make this quick, shall we?"

krg_can_patriation.2.t: "Edward and Eden Fly to Canada"
krg_can_patriation.2.d: "King Edward and Prime Minister Anthony Eden have flown to Canada today to begin the constitutional negotiations required for Canada's patriation from the dominion of the British Parliament. While Canada practically has full independence from the United Kingdom, formally the British Parliament could still amend Canada's Constitutional Acts as it so wishes. While this is unlikely to happen, Canada still symbolically wants to cut all ties with the British Parliament, as to appear more independent.\n\nThe trip is also symbolic for another reason, as it is King Edward's first trip back to Canada after the reclamation of the home isles. And while the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King didn't have the best relationship with King Edward VIII, a polite greeting is expected for the King, who had to call Canada home for the past twenty years."
krg_can_patriation.2.a: "Hopefully he'll make it back sooner this time."

krg_can_patriation.3.t: "King Meets with the British"
krg_can_patriation.3.d: "Prime Minister Mackenzie King held the first meeting with the British delegation, which included King Edward VIII and British Prime Minister Anthony Eden. The meeting was not publicized at all and held in a private room in Mackenzie King's residence, as Canada's patriation has not yet been announced to the public, or even to the provincial governments. Of course, assumptions can be made by the British delegation being sighted in Ottawa, but it is the Prime Minister's hope to make things go as smoothly as possible."
krg_can_patriation.3.a: "Hopefully the British don't make any unreasonable demands."

krg_can_patriation.4.t: "Canada begins Constitutional Negotiations"
krg_can_patriation.4.d: "Reports coming back from Canada have stated that constitutional negotiations have begun, and are proceeding smoothly so far. The British delegation which includes King Edward and Prime Minister Eden have been met with polite and valuable discussion from Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King's delegation. While of course our relationship between our two countries has certainly changed, it seems to be that both sides are treating each other with respect. While nothing valuable has been decided yet, it seems like it won't be long before the British delegation returns home, and Canada declares the start of the patriation process successful."
krg_can_patriation.4.a: "That's good to hear."

krg_can_patriation.5.t: "King Announces Constitutional Negotiations"
krg_can_patriation.5.d: "Prime Minister Mackenzie King has publicly announced his government's intention of engaging in constitutional negotiations with the United Kingdom. He has also announced that the constitutional negotiations had already started, confirming rumors that King Edward VIII and British Prime Minister Anthony Eden were in Ottawa to proceed with negotiations. Based on the idea of patriation, the British government will no longer have the ability to change the Canadian constitution if the negotiations are successful. The news has been met with the widespread support of nearly all Canadians, besides the exiles still left in the country and the most diehard monarchist. There is little doubt that the Liberal government will have trouble in negotiating the changes with the British delegation."
krg_can_patriation.5.a: "We have the support of the people."

krg_can_patriation.6.t: "Forming a Negotiatory Committee"
krg_can_patriation.6.d: "A negotiatory committee has been formed in Parliament today to advise the Prime Minister on constitutional matters and give a voice to the MPs. However, a question has arisen on whether to ensure a majority of our party members in the committee, or to make it cross-bench and invite more MPs from other parties in parliament. While it would surely be more beneficial for our government if there were a majority of our own members, this would be very unpopular with those outside the party, and could damage the negotiations."
krg_can_patriation.6.a: "Ensure a friendly majority"
krg_can_patriation.6.b: "Make it a cross-bench committee"

krg_can_patriation.8.t: "Fury Among the Exiles"
krg_can_patriation.8.d: "The British exiles that still remain in Canada today erupted in fury after hearing the government's decision to begin to patriation, and their voices are starting to get louder, and gain more fervor. Newspapers and businesses favorable to the exiles have begun a media frenzy, decrying the government for separating from Britain right after reclaiming it. Their voices in Parliament are also causing quite a stir, mostly among Conservative MPs, and many in government are starting to worry that the situation could affect the negotiation process itself. Of course, they are a much smaller and less influential group than they were before the reclamation, so we could just ignore them. Or if we do believe they are a problem, a quick deal could be cut to silence them. "
krg_can_patriation.8.a: "Ignore them."
krg_can_patriation.8.b: "Cut a deal to silence them."

krg_can_patriation.9.t: "Provincial Leaders Petition the PM"
krg_can_patriation.9.d: "Multiple provincial leaders from almost every province have petitioned the Prime Minister today in a letter calling for more involvement from the provincial governments in patriation. Since patriation was announced, many provincial leaders have become angry with the government for ignoring them and their right to participate in the patriation process. Since Canada is a federation, they argue, the provinces deserve input and a vote on any change to the Constitution.\n\nThis has not made Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] very happy, and there is no doubt that if the provinces continue to protest, the process of Patriation may take much longer than anticipated."
krg_can_patriation.9.a: "Don't make this harder than it has to be..."

krg_can_patriation.10.t: "Duplessis comes to Ottawa"
krg_can_patriation.10.d: "Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis has arrived in the capital of Ottawa today to further petition for the provincial involvement in the patriation negotiations. Duplessis is quickly becoming a figurehead for the movement that is gaining fervor across many provinces in the West, not just Quebec. During a meeting with Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], Duplessis was quick to demand more power for the provinces, throwing his weight around while also refusing to listen to the Prime Minister's counterarguments. It seems that the provinces just do not agree that patriation is a federal issue. While the Prime Minister is trying to keep things under wraps as much as possible, it may not be long before the British delegation catches wind of the provinces' grievances, and if that occurs, complications will surely follow. Duplessis has already promised to "make sure the people hear about this," as he left the meeting to return to Quebec."
krg_can_patriation.10.a: "Why do the Quebecois always have to be so difficult."

krg_can_patriation.11.t: "Fury Among Provincial Leaders"
krg_can_patriation.11.d: "With Duplessis returning to Quebec and news breaking of an impasse between the federal government and the provinces on the issue of patriation, anger and disappointment among provincial governments is beginning to to transform into complete fury against the federal government. Premiers and provincial governments are protesting left and right, going to the papers and making speeches calling the federal government "ignorant of the rights of the provinces." The opposition seems to be getting a boost as this anger rebounds onto the people as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prime Minister and his office is undergoing damage control as they try to retort any and all accusations, mostly repeating the claims that patriation is a federal issue and the provinces have no legitimate argument towards the need of their involvement in the negotiations, or the process as a whole."
krg_can_patriation.11.a: "Looks like patriation isn't going to happen anytime soon."

krg_can_patriation.12.t: "The Foreign Offices Meet"
krg_can_patriation.12.d: "With Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] unable to continue the patriation process due to the rebellious provincial premiers, the foreign offices of Canada and the United Kingdom have taken over the brunt of the negotiations. To be decided are the areas of jurisdiction, and how much the Canadian Parliament will be allowed to amend its own constitution. The British Foreign Office is expected to grant Canada somewhat of an area of jurisdiction, but some in the British delegation believe that due to the situation with the provinces, the Canadians may try to push too far, too fast."
krg_can_patriation.12.a: "Let's hope things don't get too overcomplicated."

krg_can_patriation.13.t: "Establishing the Areas of Jurisdiction"
krg_can_patriation.13.d: "The Canadian Foreign Office has been directed by the Prime Minister today to seek as much jurisdiction as possible within amending the Canadian Constitution. Currently, the British Parliament maintains strict control over Canadian constitutional matters, something that cannot be allowed to continue if Canada is supposed to be the leader of the free world. Hopefully, the British Foreign Office will understand this, and will grant a large amount of jurisdiction to the Canadian Parliament."
krg_can_patriation.13.a: "The British better not make a fuss."

krg_can_patriation.14.t: "Canadian Negotiations Begin"
krg_can_patriation.14.d: "Negotiations have begun between the British Foreign Office and Canadian Foreign Office over Canada's areas of jurisdiction. These areas of jurisdiction have to do with the Canadian Constitution, and how much the Canadian Parliament can amend their own constitution instead of relying on the British Parliament. While we are open to granting Canada some areas of jurisdiction, Conservatives and former exiles have voiced their opposition towards granting Canada too much separation from Parliament and the crown, as it would "divide the empire, just after it has been reclaimed." It would be in the best interest of both parties if Canada does not go too far in its demands."
krg_can_patriation.14.a: "Hopefully the Canadians will be reasonable."

krg_can_patriation.15.t: "The Canadian Negotiations Wear On"
krg_can_patriation.15.d: "Unfortunately, our hopes that the Canadian negotiations would progress smoothly have not have not been fully realized. The Canadians demand near total area of jurisdiction in amending their constitution, much to the chagrin of Conservatives. If we accept these areas of jurisdiction, there remains no doubt that Canada is basically separated in authority from the British Parliament. While of course our relationship has changed compared to thirty years ago, the Canadians still could be going much slower with this process.\n\nTo that end, we could put down demands that the Canadians revise their areas of jurisdiction, for going much too far. Or, we could accept the areas of jurisdiction for how they are, and to that end accept a new relationship between ourselves and the Canadians."
krg_can_patriation.15.a: "This is fine."
krg_can_patriation.15.b: "This is too far for this series of negotiations."

krg_can_patriation.16.t: "British Pushback"
krg_can_patriation.16.d: "Despite our best hopes, our areas of jurisdiction have been met with pushback by the British Foreign Office. They demand we tone down our areas of jurisdiction, which would only give us the power to amend our constitution in the case of minor changes. This is not what we hoped, however it may be best not to antagonize the British, and accept the revised areas of jurisdiction. However, what will the public think, if we bow to the British Parliament?"
krg_can_patriation.16.a: "Take the revised areas of jurisdiction."
krg_can_patriation.16.b: "Stand firm."

krg_can_patriation.17.t: "Canada Accepts Area of Jurisdiction Revisions"
krg_can_patriation.17.d: "Thankfully, the Canadian Foreign Office has notified our dignitaries that they will accept the area of jurisdiction revisions , on the condition that the Canadian Parliament can still make minor amendments to their constitution. This is fully in favor of our government, and will maintain the correct relationship between Britain and Canada. And while there has been some grumbling from the Canadians, it seems they have come to realize the dangers of going too far, too fast."
krg_can_patriation.17.a: "It seems that we still have some influence in Canadian affairs."

krg_can_patriation.18.t: "Canada Refuses Area of Jurisdiction Revisions"
krg_can_patriation.18.d: "As we expected, Canada has refused any revisions to their proposed areas of jurisdiction, demanding that the original be kept so patriation can occur effectively. They are unfortunately standing firm and are accepting no compromises at all. Our foreign office is beginning to grow restless, and if there is no intervention from an outside party the negotiations may end in failure."
krg_can_patriation.18.a: "The AoJ is a "red line" and we will not back down."

krg_can_patriation.19.t: "Anthony Eden Intervenes"
krg_can_patriation.19.d: "Just as we expected the negotiations between the foreign offices to break down, Prime Minister Anthony Eden has intervened, sending a strong message to our foreign office. We must accept the Canadian areas of jurisdiction, or risk damage in relations with the country of Canada. And while some in the foreign office responded that giving in to the Canadians would further separate Canada and Britain, it seems Prime Minister Eden's talks with the Canadians have cemented the semblance of a pro-patriation stance, at least out of pragmatism. Since the foreign office cannot go against the wills of the Prime Minister, it seems we will have to report to the Canadians that we will accept their original areas of jurisdiction."
krg_can_patriation.19.a: "We were just trying to do what was best for Britain..."

krg_can_patriation.20.t: "The British Accept Original Areas of Jurisdiction"
krg_can_patriation.20.d: "After days of the British demanding we revise the areas of jurisdiction, and it seemed like the talks were about to fall apart, both sides refusing to compromise. However, we have just received surprising word from the British Foreign Office that they will accept the original Areas of Jurisdiction. Whether the British had a change of heart, or intervention from an unknown source occured, we don't know. However, with the British now accepting our demands, it seems like the areas of jurisdiction will be finalized in our favor."
krg_can_patriation.20.a: "Finally!"

krg_can_patriation.21.t: "Progress Made with Negotiations"
krg_can_patriation.21.d: "Negotiations with the British Foreign Office over matters related to patriation, such as Areas of Jurisdiction, have seen significant progress made as of recent, certainly a good sign for negotiations going forward. In fact, most issues regarding the relationship between us and the British have been resolved, with only small, insignificant matters remaining to keep our diplomats busy.\n\nThough the resolution of most of our issues with the British is an incredible triumph, some within the government have voiced the opinion that this was only the first, and therefore easiest, hurdle we must jump over. These members believe that once we start proposing changes the legal workings of Canada itself, we may see outrage among some of the provinces, notably Quebec. Only time will tell if they are correct..."
krg_can_patriation.21.a: "Let's hope they are wrong."

krg_can_patriation.22.t: "Questions about Immigration"
krg_can_patriation.22.d: "As the Negotiatory Committee on Patriation have continued their work, recently moving onto domestic issues following the resolution of most foreign issues, they have encountered an issue which may doom their recommendations altogether. This is the matter of immigration.\n\nUnder the current system, each province within Canada has the responsibility of regulating immigration to that province, setting requirements and targeting certain groups. Some members of the negotiatory committee have proposed an overhaul to this system, with federal oversight of immigration.\n\nProponents of this approach argue that federal regulation of immigration will allow Canada to grow further, as restrictions will be more uniform and immigrants will be able to work and live in whatever province they like. Other members however, worry about how this could make the committee's recommendations look politicized, potentially resulting in a revolt among more conservative MP's and causing them to doom the recommendations."
krg_can_patriation.22.a: "This is not a federal issue"
krg_can_patriation.22.b: "Immigration must be federally protected!"

krg_can_patriation.23.t: "Outrage from Quebec"
krg_can_patriation.23.d: "The fears of some members of our government today came to pass, as the federal approach to immigration as proposed by the negotiatory committee has found it's way into the press, and the government has started recieving letters of protest from the provincial governments, most notably Quebec.\n\nPrime Minister Duplessis' letter to the government was full of accusations, though they all primarily focused on calling us various words more commonly used when talking about Oswald Mosley. Going forward, the negotiatory committee has two paths. Either they remove the language about immigration and leave it with the provinces, or they push forward uninterrupted, leaving the language about immigration in their final recommendations."
krg_can_patriation.23.a: "We pushed too far"
krg_can_patriation.23.b: "Immigration is a federal issue!"

krg_can_patriation.24.t: "Negotiations Nearing Completion"
krg_can_patriation.24.d: "The Negotiatory Committee on Patriation today announced that they are nearing completion and aim to release their recommendations soon following the resolutions of a contentious immigration debate between the committee, government, and provinces.\n\nThe committee's recommendations are expected to be incredibly detailed. This detail is rumoured to be at the request of the government, who expect to hastily write a bill containing the committee's recommendations as is to try and get it through parliament as quick as possible."
krg_can_patriation.24.a: "The future draws nearer!"

krg_can_patriation.25.t: "The Negotiatory Committee's Recommendations"
krg_can_patriation.25.d: "Today, the Negotiatory Committee on Patriation released their list of recommendations. These recommendations, as anticipated, were incredibly detailed, mainly focused on the process of amending the Constitution.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] announced the government's intention to introduce a bill in parliament containing the committee's recommendations. A version of the bill would then have to be passed by our British counterparts in London, but we have been assured that they will hold true to their commitment and will promptly pass such a bill."
krg_can_patriation.25.a: "The future of Canada is now!"

Such a commitment would cover economic development to support such equality as well as ensuring that access to public services is equal and protected for all.\n\nHowever, legal experts remain divided on whether such a clause would be able to be enforced, and some members of the government have doubts about the merits of such a clause. Ultimately though, the decision comes down to the Prime Minister."

The House of Commons is expecting to take up the matter soon, and the bill seems nearly certain to pass the Commons overwhelmingly.\n\nHowever, the House of Lords poses a unique challenge. Many of the members of the House of Lords quite recently served as Lords in Canada, and it is thought that some of those members may try and block the bill in an attempt to try and keep British authority over Canada alive, though for most intents and purposes, it is already dead."

However, at this point, pushing the Lords to pass the act will only cost us politically, as the right will see us as betraying the empire and the Lords are likely to attempt to extract significant concessions from the government."

The King also lamented what he called \"The End of Empire\" and worried about the future of Britain in a world without a British colonial presence. The Prime Minister assured him that his government has been working closely with the Canadian government, and that Britain would not be left without support.\n\nWhile the King may have had his reservations, Ottawa reacted jubilantly at the news, and our ambassador reports that a large crowd has gathered outside the Canadian Parliament building, waving flags and singing songs in celebration.

The Progressive Conservatives have released a statement condemning the alleged behavior and promising to fully cooperate with any investigations into the matter.\n\nThe scandal comes as a blow to the Progressive Conservatives, which had been riding high in the polls and was widely seen as a strong contender in the next Federal Elections.

krg_can_elect.1000.t: "1949 Liberal Convention Opens"
krg_can_elect.1000.d: "After Prime Minister Mackenzie King announced his intentions of retiring after the 1949 Elections, two men have appeared before the Liberal Party Convention in hopes of gaining the leadership. These two men are Louis St. Laurent and John Diefenbaker, figureheads of the \"Red Grits\" and \"Blue Grits\" factions, respectively. Louis St. Laurent is a well respected man within the Liberal Party and a native of Quebec, and his support among his fellow Quebecois politicians gives him a strong base in the party. St. Laurent is also currently the Interior Minister under Prime Minister King, and has experience and popularity from his role in government.\n\nMeanwhile, John Diefenbaker does not have a position in the cabinet, and has served mostly as a backbencher in Parliament. This doesn't make him any less influential however, as many Blue Grits in the party may find his leadership more enticing than St. Laurent's. It's uncertain if Diefenbaker's persona will be galvanizing enough to gain support, but with threats coming from the left and right in the coming election, the Liberal Party will want to ensure it has the strongest candidate going forward."

krg_can_elect.1001.d: "First to the podium would be Diefenbaker, hoping to make a good enough impression to get ahead of St. Laurent in the eyes of his peers. Once the polite applause ended, Diefenbaker began his speech.\n\n\"My fellow Canadians, peers, and friends, currently there is a crisis in this country. It is not caused by the hostile American Union State on our southern border, nor the autocratic Kaiser in Berlin, and it is not an economic crisis similar to the one we suffered during the Great Depression. No, it is an identity crisis, a crisis in which we, as Canadians, have no idea who we are as a people.\n\nAre we a child of Great Britain, relying on our mother country, or are we the leader of the free world, and of liberty? Are we French, culturally centered in Quebec, or are we Anglo, following British tradition? It is these questions that divide us on thin lines, when we should be united under the policy of One Canada and one identity, the Canadian identity. As Prime Minister I pledge to protect the freedom and welfare of every Canadian, and to unite us all under the ideals of liberty.\n\nOf course, I also know the importance of practical solutions, such as tax cuts across the board and a business-friendly government that further strengthens this already booming economy.\""

krg_can_elect.1002.d: "After Diefenbaker spoke, St. Laurent was quick to replace him on the podium, to much applause from the party members of Quebec. After clearing his throat, he began to speak.\n\n\"My fellow members of this grand party, while I do respect the opinions of the honorable Mr. Diefenbaker, I believe his ideals are not practical for this party at best, and downright conservative at worst. What this country needs is expanded social welfare, a national housing act, and a slow transition back into a peacetime economy, policies that will bring Canada into a new age after the most devastating period of war in history.\n\nOur new wealth can be reinvested into the people's welfare, not into tax cuts for businesses. Furthermore, we need housing for a growing population, not confusing programs like \"One Canada\" that Diefenbaker proposes. After everything that has happened the last decade, Canadians want calm, they want liberty, and they want to have the strong presence on the world stage that they deserve. If you grant me the leadership of this party, I will work tirelessly to grant Canadians those things, with your gracious support."

Already being the assumed outcome, it was his strong support with the Liberals in Quebec that safely projected him to victory.\n\nAfter a short giving of thanks to the rest of his party members, St. Laurent sat back down and Diefenbaker gave his concession, although forcibly. Still, it's certain that Diefenbaker's influence won't be going away anytime soon, with the Liberals still divided as a party.\n\nIn the end, if everything goes to plan for the Liberal party, Louis St. Laurent will become the next Prime Minister of Canada, and lead the nation into another decade of Liberal rule."

A known supporter of more closed immigration, Drew has raised fears that American refugees from the civil war could harm Canadian culture and push out hard working Canadians in the workforce. Drew has also promised his party and his voters lower taxes across the board, railing against Liberal tax policy as \"choking out every single Canadian dollar a man has,\" and has specifically promised to repeal wealth taxes on the richest of Canadians.\n\nFurthermore, Drew made a rather audacious announcement, a promise to \"crack down on the CCF,\" and investigate possible syndicalist collusion in the party. He and other Conservative Party members have repeatedly called the CCF an anti-Canadian group bent on eliminating Canadian prosperity and democracy. Whether these bold promises will sway the Canadian voter remains to be seen."

A self-described socialist, Coldwell has made many wide-ranging promises to improve the Canadian welfare system and to quickly demobilize the Canadian economy.\n\nColdwell is also publicly open to immigration, stating that Canada \"should be a home to the poor and the persecuted, from anywhere in the world.\" Most significantly, Coldwell has promised new ambitious healthcare reforms which aim to assist those who cannot properly afford the healthcare they need.\n\nIt remains uncertain if the CCF can have any chance in this upcoming election, but with turbulent times already in the past, many Canadians may be willing to try a new, younger party."

With their slogan \"Canada's natural path,\" the Liberal party seems to be banking on their past recognition and popularity to stay ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservative Party aims to win over the population with promises for a stable, strong Canada. Their campaign slogan, \"An old party for a new Canada,\" seems to comment on Canada's new role in global affairs.\n\nThe current third largest party, the CCF, is running a hopeful, down to earth campaign aimed at appealing to the current economic situation. While they are polling well with laborers and farmers, it's uncertain if the CCF can appeal to a larger demographic. Still, their campaign slogan \"CCF to victory\" seems to show that the party leadership has the confidence for successful election results.\n\nAnd finally, the Unionists have been working on gathering attention for their campaign, even though they have virtually no chance in the elections. Still, with their slogan \"You and me for W.A.C.,\" party leader W.A.C. Bennet seems to be running a very candidate-centered campaign."

As such, their policies of expanded welfare, open immigration, and radical systematic change remain largely untested in the political sphere.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the CCF shall govern, but if their policies are any indication, the next few years of CCF rule shall be full of dramatic change for Canada."

###Alaska Events
krg_can_cal_alaska.1.t: "The Alaskan Referendum"
krg_can_cal_alaska.1.d: "Arguably just as important to our politics of the last decade as the Second Weltkrieg was the Second American Civil War, a conflict that destroyed our closest neighbor and presented us with a series of crises along our borders. While most of these have been handled either decisively or through standing agreements, one sticking point remains: the question of Alaska. During the conflict, our forces moved to secure it and our Western border with the United States, forming a territorial government under our protection with promises to ensure its return to an American government following the Second American Civil War. Under this agreement, American politicians and communities would be allowed to continue their lives mostly as they had been, with Canadian forces replacing the American federal government when necessary but refrain from any lasting alterations to the territory, believing their stay to only be temporary.\n\nOf course, over a decade after the opening shots of the Second American Civil War, the situation is far from what was expected when the agreement was struck. Many Canadians have moved to Alaska seeking its mineral and material wealth, forming new communities and organizations, while Americans have begun to move to the 'Lower 48' as the conflict has begun to wind down. This demographic shift has caused the beginnings of a crisis to form in the territory, a crisis some in our government seek to avoid by presenting the territory with a referendum: either rejoining the United States by the Pacific government in Sacramento or remaining with us as a formal part of the Dominion of Canada. This, they believe, is the best way to prevent conflict while also maintaining goodwill with our Southern ally. Of course, there are other, more hardline politicians, who see the territory as an integral part of Canada at this point, and see a referendum as bowing to the Americans. They seem to want to simply announce its annexation, the Americans be damned, a move likely to be popular among our population but hurt our relations with the Americans. We could always also simply hand it over, a move likely to bring us goodwill with the Americans but harm our own public image, as the current government could be seen as weak to the pressure of American rump states."

When the outcome of the civil war to our south was uncertain, it was imperative to secure our western border and utilize the bountiful resources of Alaska for our war effort. We still occupy Alaska over a decade later, much to the chagrin of our allies in San Francisco and our enemies in New Orleans. Alaska's status within Canada has remained in limbo for years now and something must be done.\n\nWe have decided that the best course of action will be to return Alaska to the United States via the Pacific government. Despite significant Canadian investment and settlement, Alaska will be recognized and returned as a sovereign territory of the United States. This gift will act as an olive branch to San Francisco, which has thus far kept its cooperation with The Accord at arm's length when compared to our partners in Boston. This immense measure of goodwill should shore up any doubts that the Pacific government might have over our commitment to this relationship. A ceremony will be held in Juneau this evening to formalize the transfer of governance over to the Americans."

krg_can_cal_alaska.3.d: "Our decision to circumvent Parliament and return the territory of Alaska to the Americans has been met with significant backlash from members of Parliament. Many Canadian citizens considered Alaska to be a prize well earned for our aid to the Americans during their time of crisis. Thousands of Canadians and British exiles settled in that region and developed it with our resources. Critics were quick to point out that the gifting of Alaska was not a net-zero gain for Canada due to the loss of those investments. Without a referendum, there is now an uproar against the disregard for the democratic process or the voices of our citizens who now have to decide between living under American rule or picking up everything to move back to Canada.\n\nWhile this move was not expected to be popular on the homefront, the response has been much worse than anticipated. Still, ensuring that the Americans are cooperative is one of our highest priorities in this brewing cold war. The gift of Alaska is our investment in America's future and hopefully will pay dividends for ours as well. Many members of parliament do not agree with our administration's decision, however. And this will likely hurt our party's popularity in the polls in the immediate future."
krg_can_cal_alaska.3.a: "This will benefit us more in the long term... probably."
krg_can_cal_alaska.4.t: "American Riots in Anchorage"
krg_can_cal_alaska.4.d: "After over a decade of Canadian settlement, the American population of Alaska has only maintained a modest lead over Canadian citizens in the territory. With a near plurality among Americans and Canadians, it was assumed that the full annexation of Alaska Territory would have been a welcome one. We were wrong...\n\nAs soon as the news was made public, the Anchorage Daily News reported an Op-Ed with scathing criticism. The paper, run by American business interests, called for a protest of the annexation. Written by pro-statehood correspondents, it decried Canada's decision as 'an affront to the values of democracy' and told Alaskans that their 'voices won't be ignored by disinterested parliamentarians.' The protest in Downtown Anchorage started peacefully and was monitored by RCMP officers. As pro-statehood leader Bill Egan spoke in front of City Hall, his rhetoric would become increasingly critical of the Canadian occupation. His speech riled up the nearly 700 Americans present when an unrelated arrest on 4th Avenue was mistaken for one of the protestors. Egan demanded the unknown arrestee be released, leading a nearby RCMP officer to arrest Egan himself for obstruction of justice. Egan's arrest drew the agitated Americans into a frenzy, leading to a riot on 4th Avenue. Over 100 were injured with at least 3 confirmed dead in the wake of the riot and the RCMP's attempt to contain it. Several police vehicles were destroyed with a significant amount of property damage mostly aimed at Canadian businesses. The rioters unsuccessfully attempted to seize City Hall but continued to cause havoc well into the night. A state of emergency has been declared in Anchorage and Egan remains incarcerated as the 'ringleader' of the Anchorage Riot."
krg_can_cal_alaska.4.a: "Damn Yanks!"
krg_can_cal_alaska.5.t: "Crisis in Anchorage"
krg_can_cal_alaska.5.d: "A distressing report was left on the desk of President [CAL.GetName] this morning in the wake of the deadly riots in Anchorage, Alaska yesterday. Alongside a copy of yesterday's edition of the Anchorage Daily News, we have been made aware that the Canadian government has decided to annex Alaska and arrest American protestor, Bill Egan, inciting a riot. With at least three dead and a hundred injured, the [CAL.GetName] administration cannot ignore the tragedy that took place in Anchorage.\n\nAn emergency meeting was held with the Secretary of State to discuss San Francisco's response to Ottawa's unlawful actions. Not only is the American public in an uproar over the riots, but the undemocratic annexation of Alaska is a significant slight from our supposed allies. A call for a referendum to allow the American majority in Alaska to voice their opinions is being made in solidarity with the victims of this tragedy. With Anchorage in a state of martial law, the crisis will only grow if we do not act. President [CAL.GetName] must either make a direct call to action and demand Canada allow the Alaskan people to decide their future, or he can allow the State Department to issue a statement condemning Canada's actions. The call for justice is alluring, but maintaining our alliance with Canada is more important than ever in this geopolitical climate."
krg_can_cal_alaska.5.a: "Lodge a formal protest, this won't stand!"
krg_can_cal_alaska.5.b: "Only issue a mild condemnation, we can't risk the alliance."
krg_can_cal_alaska.6.t: "The Americans Back Down"
krg_can_cal_alaska.6.d: "Despite the mistakes made in Anchorage, the Americans have made it clear that they are more interested in cooperation with Canada than the return of Alaska. President [CAL.GetName]'s Secretary of State issued a statement condemning the behavior of the RCMP and our decision to annex the territory without referendum, but have made no formal diplomatic actions to force our hand. With nothing more than a diplomatic speed bump between us and full annexation, Alaska will formally be recognized as a Territory of Canada!\n\nExtra resources will be sent to Anchorage to speed up repairs with special dispensation for the families of the victims of the riot. The state of emergency has been lifted and Bill Egan has been released from custody, hopefully signaling the end to this Anchorage Riot mess once and for all. Meanwhile, Union State President [TEX.GetName] issued a statement condemning both our government for its 'unlawful occupation of American territory' and San Francisco for being 'full of weak Canadian lap dogs.' While we do not acknowledge the Union State's government, knowing that our western border is secure from their military will help many of our citizens sleep easier. Now we have plenty of work to do to fully integrate Alaska Territory into our government."
krg_can_cal_alaska.6.a: "That could have gone worse."
krg_can_cal_alaska.7.t: "A Telegram from San Francisco"
krg_can_cal_alaska.7.d: "In the wake of the Anchorage Riots, the [CAL.GetName] Administration has formally challenged our annexation of Alaska. Citing a 'flagrant disregard for the democratic process' and our law enforcement's 'heavy handed approach to a peaceful protest', San Francisco is demanding we put the fate of the territory up to a vote. While we are in no way beholden to the demands of President [CAL.GetName], our alliance with the Pacific government might hang in the balance. While we have invested heavily in Alaska, it is still largely frontier. Are we willing to risk our economic and military ties to the Pacific States over a land of ice and snow?\n\nOur government is divided over its next course of action. Many pro-Accord MPs and democratic idealists support the referendum proposal, but the nationalist and unionist leaning MPs want to affirm Canada's sovereign right to govern its territory. Diplomats from the Boston government have also urged us to approve a referendum. Even if we win, it will have been a costly endeavor to campaign in our favor. Convincing the Inuit and American homesteaders to support the Canadian status quo will be difficult, and it would be much simpler for us to ignore the call for a referendum. The initiative is ours, however - and the fate of Alaska is in Canada's hands."
krg_can_cal_alaska.7.a: "Approve a referendum, maybe that will placate them."
krg_can_cal_alaska.7.b: "They need to reamain in their lane."
krg_can_cal_alaska.8.t: "The Cold Shoulder"
krg_can_cal_alaska.8.d: "Despite our call for Canada to respect the democratic process, Ottawa has chosen to go ahead with its annexation of Alaska without a referendum. President [CAL.GetName] issued a statement today that maligned the decision, describing it as 'a wedge in the goodwill between our governments.' With few tools in our diplomatic arsenal for recourse in this situation, San Francisco must sit idly by as Canada formalizes the theft of our land.\n\nOur partners in Boston have issued a mild condemnation, focusing more on the lack of referendum than the annexation of the territory itself. Meanwhile, a congressional committee has been formed to draft immigration measures that would streamline the repatriation of American citizens living in Alaska. While NATO requires the use of Canada to facilitate trade with our American allies, we can still find some measures to retaliate through the taxation of certain Canadian imports. Needless to say, we have significantly less motivation to commit military forces to the cause of The Accord moving forward."
krg_can_cal_alaska.8.a: "We'll remember this..."
krg_can_cal_alaska.9.t: "Canada Announces Referendum for Alaska"
krg_can_cal_alaska.9.d: "Recently, as those who follow the news from our Northern neighbor are likely aware, the Canadian government has announced a referendum to begin as to the future of the territory of Alaska within the next few months. Alaska, of course, saw itself placed under Canadian 'protection' during the Second American Civil War, its territorial government continuing under Canadian auspices until the promised return to the United States. However, as time has gone on, our fellow countrymen in Alaska seem to have agitated for their return to America, something the Canadians seem willing to grant... upon a conditional referendum. This referendum, to be voted on by all those within the territory, presents the voters with a choice of either remaining part of Canada or rejoining our government as a territorial administration.\n\nWhile many within our territory believe it is likely that Alaska will vote to return to our government, the Canadian population within the territory has grown in recent years, and it is not as sure a statement as we may be inclined to hope. To this end, our administration's Consulate in Juneau has presented us with a number of options to help tilt the referendum's results in our favor, connecting with pro-American pressure groups and those organizations still functioning under the Canadian administration to promote our viewpoint. With luck, Alaska will once more be part of America, and plans have already been drawn up should it join our administration to grant it the long-desired status of statehood."
krg_can_cal_alaska.9.a: "An opportunity we can't let slip."
krg_can_cal_alaska.10.t: "The American Campaign Begins"
krg_can_cal_alaska.10.d: "Following the announcement of our referendum, it was entirely expected that campaigns either for or against the referendum would begin in earnest. Pro-American groups almost immediately seemed to unfurl their pre-war Old Glory banners, while Pro-Canadian groups could ubiquitously be seen with both Union Jacks and the various banners of Canadian pride. Each of them seem to have completely canvassed Anchorage, Juneau, and the smaller towns and villages all over the territory, attempting to encourage their own side of the referendum through various means.\n\nWhat has been less appreciated is the increasing reports of American officials supporting the referendum, with local officials placing signs and banners in favor of the referendum in their own government offices while American pressure groups have started to see increases in their funding from sources south of Vancouver. It has become clear following our own investigations that these are not merely spontaneous actions by concerned American private citizens but actions tacitly approved and even supported by the Pacific States government in Sacramento, clearly attempting to help tilt the referendum in their favor. While this is neither illegal nor unexpected, it has increased pressure on our own government to begin tilting the referendum in our favor as well, something we have been planning for quite some time. While the Americans may have their own groups on the ground, we have the advantage of actually governing the territory, and can use this to boost our own message, provided we do not go too overboard."
krg_can_cal_alaska.10.a: "Unsuprising, but we can act as well."
krg_can_cal_alaska.11.t: "Alaska Remains"
krg_can_cal_alaska.11.d: "After weeks of campaigning in favor of the status quo, we have won the Alaskan Referendum! Through a combination of economic investment and clever campaigning, we have somehow managed to convince the Alaskan people that the Canadian way is the right way forward! And while it was no easy feat to tackle the American pro-statehood bloc, Alaska is firmly in our hands.\n\nMen and women over the age of 18 came from all across Alaska to vote. Americans, Canadians, Natives, and a myriad of European and Asian immigrants who have settled in these frozen lands. Bill Egan has demanded a recount, and while will oblige his request we have already begun to move forward with the necessary procedures to fully integrate Alaska as a federal territory of Canada. And with the damage done in Anchorage, we have chosen to hold an official integration ceremony in Juneau as the territory's capital.\n\nA representative from San Francisco was present at the ceremony, but his statement was a short yet courteous statement about supporting the democratic process. After a few speeches from Canadian officials on integration and Alaska's importance in the Accord, a rousing rendition of 'Oh Canada' was performed by the local high school band. Soon we will hold elections to represent Alaska in Parliament, and the bulk of Alaska's assimilation will be complete!"
krg_can_cal_alaska.11.a: "A Mari Usque Ad Mare!"

krg_can_cal_alaska.12.t: "Alaska Remains"
krg_can_cal_alaska.12.d: "Despite our best efforts, our plan to regain Alaska through popular vote has failed. The polls closed at 9 P.M. last night and despite the hope that a recount might save us, the Canadians have won the hearts and minds of the Alaskan people. Even though the Canadian occupation of Alaska was legally questionable, the referendum has given them all of the legitimacy they could have asked for. This was our last card to play and the future of our nation currently hinges on a good relationship with our neighbors to the North. The best thing for us to do is to hold our heads high and look for other opportunities to strengthen our nation for the possibility of a continuation war in the East.\n\nWe have sent a delegate to congratulate Canada at their victory ceremony in Juneau. It is expected that a fair number of Americans in Alaska will choose to move back home to the mainland now that the prospect of statehood is dead. Our administration is already working on a resettlement policy for these American expats. Still, the media is blaming President [CAL.GetName] for fumbling 663,268 square miles of land and the bountiful resources of Alaska; this will surely hurt our party's chances in the next election. "
krg_can_cal_alaska.12.a: "Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but sometimes, playing a poor hand as well."

krg_can_cal_alaska.13.t: "Alaska Returns"
krg_can_cal_alaska.13.d: "Despite weeks of campaigning in favor of the status quo, the Pacific States have won the Alaskan Referendum. With their backs to the sea, the prospect of growth drove the Americans onward. The pro-statehood bloc resonated with the largely American voter base and we failed to sway enough of the native votes to tip the scales. The Americans called our bluff and we can no longer fight their claims to Alaska - it will be promptly transferred to the sovereign governance of the San Francisco government.\n\nGiving a victory speech from the same Anchorage City Hall that he was arrested at mere weeks ago, Bill Egan praised the democratic process for giving a voice to the Alaskan people. A formal transfer ceremony will be held in the territory's capital of Juneau where we will symbolically cede control of the territory to the Pacific diplomat.\n\nWhile we are militarily aligned with the Pacific States, we have swiftly begun packing our equipment and pulling all Canadian assets out of Alaska. The loss of 663,268 square miles will be hard enough on our administration's popularity, so the least we can do is preserve every ounce of materiel for Canadian use. But we cannot complain too much. Our allies in Boston and San Francisco have been over the moon with their victory here. Our relationship with our NATO allies is more important than ever, and may very well be worth the price of Alaska if we want to win this brewing cold war."
krg_can_cal_alaska.13.a: "The more I thought about leaving it, the less I liked the idea."

krg_can_cal_alaska.14.t: "Alaska Returns"
krg_can_cal_alaska.14.d: "After weeks of campaigning in favor of statehood, we have succeeded in winning the Alaskan Referendum! Thousands of Americans, Canadians, Natives, and various European and Asian settlers over the age of eighteen came out last night to vote on the future of Alaska and it appears as though our efforts paid off! President [CAL.GetName] released a statement reaffirming the value of the democratic process and praising this as a victory for America and a victory for democracies around the globe. His many public statements will no doubt help the party's popularity in the upcoming elections - returning 663,268 square miles of territory will no doubt be spun as proof of the Pacific Government's legitimacy as the inheritor of the US government's will.\n\nNew England's President [NEE.GetName] personally sent a telegram to [CAL.GetName] for his invaluable contribution to the reclamation of the United States. Meanwhile, we have already ordered the transfer of a Pacific Fleet Task Force to begin to garrison Alaska from the Aleutians to Juneau. Our return to Anchorage has been hailed as liberators by many, and our forces will be personally greeted by Bill Egan who undoubtedly aims to push the issue of statehood to Congress now that Alaska has been returned to us. Meanwhile, a ceremonial transfer of power will be held in Juneau and we have dispatched the Pacific Marine Band to mark the occasion with the Star Spangled Banner and the works of John Philip Sousa.\n\nA mountain of work lies ahead of us as we reintegrate Alaska after nearly fifteen years under Canadian management. But Americans have nothing if not an industrious and adventurous spirit, and we are more than up to the task of bringing Alaska up to working order. And we will inevitably be hit with the statehood question which would certainly cement Alaska as a sovereign American territory but might throw a serious wrench into our delicate political balance by adding two senators for barely a hundred thousand souls. But that is a question for another day - tonight, we celebrate!"

Kristgeir's father had been a fisherman, so had his grandfather, and his son would be one as well. It was what their family did. He couldn't imagine a life away from the coasts, waves, and without the smell of the ocean. It was a fulfilling life, but not an easy one.\n\nIceland had never been a wealthy country, and the war certainly hadn't helped. The largest ports in the country were run-down, much less the barely-holding scraps of wood that comprised the port in his village. Supplies were becoming more scarce, and some of his friends had lost their boats because of the war.\n\nIt would have been dire, had the Canadians not come to Iceland recently, including his small town, promising to invest in the ports, provide boats to fishermen, and repair the damage. Kristgeir had been skeptical at first, but every day since, he'd seen his once shabby port be not only repaired - but expanded. Now his business had never been better, and while things weren't quite back to normal..."

And here, mere weeks later, he'd received everything he needed. He'd only requested enough for a successful harvest - seeds, fertilizer, and some newer tools.\n\nAll of that had been delivered and more. He had feared that if the harvest was poor, that he would be forced to sell the farm, but with this delivery he'd be able to at least get through the next couple of years. He didn't know why the Canadians were being so generous, while asking barely anything in return, but he would be forever thankful.\n\nSaying a quick prayer of thanks, Lafaille hummed a tune as he returned to his house to give his wife the good news."

###ALASKA REFERENDUM###
CAN_CAL_alaska_referendum: "The Alaskan Referendum"
CAN_CAL_alaska_referendum_desc: "Originally a territory of the §BUnited States§! following a purchase from Russia of the land in 1867, the Second American Civil War saw the Last Frontier separated from the rest of the country, the relatively lightly-settled territory having little in the way of conflict or attempted violence by the groups which rocked the rest of America. In a move seen by some as protection from the violence America found itself in, and others as a naked grab for territory, §RCanada§! placed the territory under its control, forming a government in coordination with the §YAmericans§! in the state to govern it until such time as the future of Alaska could be decided. Now, with the war seemingly long since frozen, a referendum has been declared in order to determine the long-term fate of Alaska: either a transfer to the §YPacific States of America§! as a return to the American fold, or remaining in §RCanada§!, now as a formalized part of the rising power. Both those Americans who remained in Alaska during and after the conflict and the Canadians who came to settle the territory in its ten-year stay within Canada seek to see Alaska given to their own side, with politicians on both sides of the border campaigning for their end of the referendum. The §Gnative population§! of Alaska, meanwhile, is pulled by both sides, concessions being promised and discounted in order to attempt to sway their vote. Despite the energetic campaigns, only time will tell what the fate of Alaska will be, something many across the territory await with bated breath..."
