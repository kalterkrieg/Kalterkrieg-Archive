One of the victims was a young man named Firas. His father, filled with wrath over his son's death, blamed the government for the tragedy. Abu Firas, consumed by grief and anger, took his weapon and followed President Chamoun. They encountered each other near the mayor's office in Zahle, where Abu Firas shot the president. After the shooting, Abu Firas turned himself in to the authorities. Following his interrogation, the Lebanese army executed Abu Firas by firing squad."
