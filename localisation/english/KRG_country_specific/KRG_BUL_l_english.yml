BUL_idea_treaty_of_dedinje: "The Treaty of Dedinje"
BUL_idea_treaty_of_dedinje_desc: "The 4th Balkan War, which started so promisingly, ended in abject disaster for Bulgaria. The Belgrade Pact, in their fear towards us, imposed conditions which destroyed any potential for our military to make a comeback. Now, our factories sit empty, half built weapons lie in the factories and incomplete ships float, docked themselves in empty harbours, waiting for a day when they will be completed, a day which will seemingly never come. The army, once the grandest in the Balkans, isn't able to take on recruits, barred from fresh blood. May God help us now."

BUL_idea_shaky_economic_standing: "Shaky Economic Standing"
BUL_idea_shaky_economic_standing_desc: "A decade has passed since our decisive loss in the 4th Balkan War. Since then we've had trouble re-establishing our economy, suffering from the loss of huge swathes of fertile farmland. These circumstances have forced our country to develop our economy in a new industrial civilian economy, moving away from the agrarianism which had dominated Bulgaria for so long. We have had small successes during this industrialisation, but there is still much more to do; one small event could tip the balance and send us into economic freefall. It's up to us to find the light and establish a solid economy, otherwise we could plunge into hell."

BUL_idea_growing_nationalist_discontent: "Rising Radicalism"
BUL_idea_growing_nationalist_discontent_desc: "The Bulgarian people are radicalising. Empowered by the rising national discontent in the wake of the 4th Balkan War and the Treaty of Dedinje, radicals are plotting to overthrow the National Assembly, and they grow in strength every day.\n\nOn the left, Syndicalist, Communists and other assorted Marxists have joined forces under the banner of the Valko Chervenkov's United Socialist Party, presenting a thin veneer of democratic sensibility while agitating for the abolition of the monarchy and the destruction of our free constitution. On the right an even bigger threat grows. Once irrelevant, the ultranationalistic National Legions have captured the attention of the youth of Bulgaria. Hristo Lukov leads an organisation inspired by both Russia's Savinkov and Romania's Codreanu, seeking to overthrow the government and restore Bulgaria's 'National Pride'.\n\nThe growing political instability and radicalism could spell disaster to both our democracy, and the stability of the Balkans. If the Socialists and the Legionaries aren't dealt with soon, then we could very well face an insurrection, or even worse a civil war."

BUL_idea_political_crisis: "The Bulgarian Crisis"
BUL_idea_political_crisis_desc: "The growing tide of radicalism and partisanship is beginning to paralyse the nation. Paramilitary violence is commonplace, as Legionaries fight the OSPB in pitched battles, and partisan deputies in the National Assembly grow ever more opposed and polarised. Assasination attempts, successful or otherwise, are now commonplace, with figures from across the political spectrum being targeted for all manner of reasons. As the 'Second National Humiliation' continues to hang over the country, and the Treaty of Dedinje keeps us artificially weakened, more and more people lose faith in the constitutional system. The Tsardom is breaking apart."

BUL_idea_for_the_king: "For the Tsar!"
BUL_idea_for_the_leader: "For the Vodač!"
BUL_idea_for_the_revolution: "For the Revolution!"

###events###
krg_bul.1.t: "Monetary Inflation of the Bulgarian Lev Critical"
krg_bul.1.d: "The National Bank of Bulgaria today warned that the government would be facing stark prospects due to the increasing weakness of the Lev\nThe Finance Minister stated that the government intended to reduce the supply of money in the economy, however he warned that this would take time to take effect."
krg_bul.1.a: "But will it be too long?"

krg_bul.2.t: "Bulgaria Unable To Continue Dedinje Repayments"
krg_bul.2.d: "The softening Lev has meant that the payments that were promised as part of the Treaty of Dedinje have become a massive drain on the economy.\nSince they are determined in foreign currency, we are burning increasingly ridiculous amounts of foreign reserve currency when we need to hold onto it.\nAs such, the government has been forced to default on payments."
krg_bul.2.a: "This is not good."

krg_bul.3.t: "Protests Against Inflation Begin"
krg_bul.3.d: "People took to the streets in Plovdiv, Sofia and Varna today to protest the inflation of the Lev and the government's economic policy. The removal of low-value notes from circulation has forced already rising prices to spiral due to the inability of people to use smaller currency.\nNow the people have had enough it seems, and the looks set to be rocked by the dissatisfaction of it's people, as they chant on the streets for bare necessities."
krg_bul.3.a: "We want bread! We want bread!"

krg_bul.4.t: "Gridlock In The Coalition"
krg_bul.4.d: "The governing coalition presided over acrimonous scenes today in parliament as matters came to a head.\nThe leading parties were unable to come to an agreement on the cure for the inflationary disease, with the Finance Minister resigning on the spot when the Prime Minister sought to override his policy!"
krg_bul.4.a: "This is really not good."

krg_bul.5.t: "Protests Turn To Riots"
krg_bul.5.d: "The peaceful protestations have taken on a nasty turn in character, with the chanting crowds now filling out with men who have nothing better to do, since working pays nothing worth spending.\nThe currency is approaching levels of complete worthlessness and prices double inside the space of a day.\nThe mood has soured as hunger stalks the streets and the people are now throwing cobbles and bricks at government offices." 
krg_bul.5.a: "The end is near!"

krg_bul.6.t: "The Government Collapses"
krg_bul.6.d: "As everything devolved into fingerpointing today in Parliament, the governing coalition officially broke up.\nWith the small parties suddenly thrust into importance, the party leaders cast around desperately in order to try and rally together a coalition to take over the government.\nThe floor of the parliament resembled a market today, as members called to one another, making offers and counter offers at the top of their voices."
krg_bul.6.a: "Nobody manages to form a government!"
krg_bul.6.b: "The Social Democrats organise a coalition."
krg_bul.6.c: "The Agrarian Union organises a coalition."

krg_bul.7.t: "A Snap Election Is Called"
krg_bul.7.d: "With the government unable to govern, and the coalition in shambles, the Prime Minister went to Tsar Boris and got the monarch's assent for a snap election in order to get the people of Bulgaria to determine the future, and allow a unified response to the issues besetting the country.\nAcross the nation, the polling stations are already being set up."
krg_bul.7.a: "Perhaps we can find a way out here"

krg_bul.8.t: "A Grand Alliance"
krg_bul.8.d: "Beset on both sides by radical parties of the left and right, the centre parties have agreed to form a single 'Popular Bloc' that they hope will represent the majority of national opinion in Bulgaria, and keep the dangerous extremes out of power.\nIt remains to be seen if the mainstream of Bulgarian politics is where these parties stand anymore."
krg_bul.8.a: "Good luck?"

krg_bul.9.t: "Election Day"
krg_bul.9.d: "The bells tolled from the churches in the villages and in the cities those factories that still had workers blew the whistle and called a day off. Everyone went to vote in this election, it was considered too important to allow anyone to have an excuse to not be involved.\nTo be honest, the flaky value of the Lev has meant that most people have been working to find something or make something to barter. Bakers are doing well of late. But even they had to vote today, for the thin line of the rule of law is the only thing stopping the increasingly hungry masses from seizing their flour and making their own.\nIt is against this backdrop that..."
krg_bul.9.a: "The 'Popular Bloc' Win"
krg_bul.9.b: "The OSPB (Socialists) Win"
krg_bul.9.c: "The SBNL (Legionaries) Win"

krg_bul.10.t: "The 'Popular Bloc' Wins"
krg_bul.10.d: "Despite the issues that democracy has faced in Bulgaria, the people are still willing to back mainstream parties and reject extremism!\nNow the Popular Bloc have their work cut out for them, recovering the economy, as the Legionnaires claim that the election was stolen from them by a conspiracy and the OSPB street-fighters are out in force to demonstrate that the ballot box is not as effective as the hammer."
krg_bul.10.a: "We're just getting started."

krg_bul.11.t: "Dealing With The Crisis"
krg_bul.11.d: "The Legionaries are perhaps the most dangerous element on the right - their radical agenda however does have a weakness, as like the Iron Guard in Romania and the Russian's with Savinkov, the snake has a head. A single leader, who can be killed and will throw his subordinates into disarray as they struggle amongst themselves to make the pecking order once again.\nIt is not a savory choice, but the government must govern."
krg_bul.11.a: "We can't all be boy scouts here."

krg_bul.12.t: "Hristo Lukov Assassinated"
krg_bul.12.d: "The leader of the radical Legionary organisation in Bulgaria has been killed today. His people are blaming the Socialists for sending an assassin into their midst and none seem to realise the action of the government in the matter.\nThe body was barely cool before the party split along factional lines between two of his lieutenants, and it appears the Legionaries will be distracted thinning each other's numbers for some time yet."
krg_bul.12.a: "Dovizhdane, Lukov"

krg_bul.13.t: "Banning The OSPB"
krg_bul.13.d: "With the Legionaries dealt with, the other threat to the democracy in Bulgaria is the OSPB. Their anti-monarchist sentiment and aggressive anti-wealth policies will leave the nation starving, penniless and barefoot for generations.\nUnlike the Legionaries however, they do have an official party headquarters. We can send the police to arrest them as members of a banned, anti-state organisation. The bill just requires the signature of the Prime Minister."
krg_bul.13.a: "They escape!"
krg_bul.13.b: "They are arrested!"

krg_bul.14.t: "The Bulgarian Revolution"
krg_bul.14.d: "The banning of the OSPB failed when one of the police officers tasked with the operation called a friend of his inside the building and let them know that the police were coming to arrest them.\nNow the OSPB and their streetfighting thugs have taken up arms from hidden caches, brought out the red flags and declared an anti-monarchist revolution. We are in civil war!"
krg_bul.14.a: "Shit."
krg_bul.14.b: "To arms comrades!"

krg_bul.15.t: "The Crisis Is Over"
krg_bul.15.d: "With the OSPB banned and the Legionaries still embroiled in internecine turmoil, the Popular Bloc now has a chance to govern.\nNew economic policy seems to be showing some signs of curbing the inflation of the Lev, and with the default on payments of the Dedinje treaty, the economy is starting to come back to life."
krg_bul.15.a: "Excellent!"

krg_bul.16.t: "The New Socialist Government"
krg_bul.16.d: "Having swept into the power with a democratic mandate, the OSPB can finally start to make it's imprint on the nation. However, the Legionaries are claiming there's a conspiracy orchestrated against them by the international regime of Zionist Leftists and are agitating against the government.\nThere are a couple of actions we can take to deal with the threat they pose - either go after Lukov, their leader, or actively strengthen the regime against the inevitable bourgeois counter-terror."
krg_bul.16.a: "Kill the snake by cutting of it's head!"
krg_bul.16.b: "Lay down the guns in hidden places and prepare."

krg_bul.17.t: "Legionaries March On Sofia"
krg_bul.17.d: "In a scene reminiscent of olden times, columns of Legionaries have marched on the capital in order to overthrow the government.\nThe police and army, such as they are, have been deployed to manage and contain them, but there are some concerns about who they are really loyal to, and the OSPB chapters from other cities are unable to make it to the capital in time."
krg_bul.17.a: "The Legionaries are beaten by the state"
krg_bul.17.b: "The troops help the Legionaries!"

krg_bul.18.t: "Zveno Attempts To Seize Control"
krg_bul.18.d: "The Zveno (Link) political circle has strong ties to those who believe in law and order. They are arguably more popular amongst the armed forces and police than the Legionaries are, who are regarded as trouble makers.\nSeeing the moment, they've now made their move, taking advantage of the chaos to beat down both Socialists and Legionaries alike and impose a military state on Bulgaria!"
krg_bul.18.a: "Zveno partially succeed, Socialists flee."
krg_bul.18.b: "Zveno succeed, all pieces off the board."

krg_bul.19.t: "Socialist-Monarchist Civil War"
krg_bul.19.d: "With Zveno's attempted seizure of power, the OSPB managed to escape the chaos and have now taken up arms in order to fight for their beliefs.\nThe nation is at war with itself!"
krg_bul.19.a: "Woe... woe is us!"

krg_bul.20.t: "The Royalists Consolidate"
krg_bul.20.d: "After many hard fought battles, and some ignominious defeats too, the OSPB are on the run. The Zveno and other Royalists have managed to put the godless atheist scum down. Bulgaria will remain a Tsardom, and the Zveno will free the nation from the shackles imposed on it."
krg_bul.20.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

krg_bul.21.t: "The Revolution Secured"
krg_bul.21.d: "After many hard fought battles, and some ignominious defeats too, the Zveno are on the run. The OSPB, through left unity and superior discipline have managed to put the superstitious monarchist scum down. Bulgaria will be liberated to a people's republic, and the OSPB will free the nation from the shackles imposed on it."
krg_bul.21.a: "Long live the Revolution!"

krg_bul.22.t: "The Monarchy Abolished"
krg_bul.22.d: "The forces of the Bulgarian People's Army today entered the Vrana Palace in Sofia and met with Boris Klemens Robert Maria Pius Ludwig Stanislaus Xaver Saxe-Coburg Gotha, stripping him of his royal title and ending the Monarchy of Bulgaria that had existed in some sense or another for a thousand years.\nValko Chervenkov, as Chairman of the Obedinena Sotsialisticheska Partiya na Bulgariya became the de jure Head of State of Bulgaria in his place."
krg_bul.22.a: "Down with the Monarchy!"

krg_bul.23.t: "Carbombing Fails"
krg_bul.23.d: "The attempt to kill Hristo Lukov has failed! The carbomb in his vehicle drained the battery and when the engine failed to turn over after an attempt he became suspicious and checked the vehicle.\nThe Legionaries are already grumbling about this, and it can only be bad news."
krg_bul.23.a: "Shit."

krg_bul.24.t: "Legionaries Organize"
krg_bul.24.d: "Lukov has directed his band of thugs to take up arms and prepare to fight the state for the 'Salvation of Bulgaria and her Pride'. It looks like we will be having a war on our hands soon enough."
krg_bul.24.a: "Double shit!"

krg_bul.25.t: "Zveno Coup, Government Escapes"
krg_bul.25.d: "The Zveno (Link) political circle has strong ties to those who believe in law and order. They are arguably more popular amongst the armed forces and police than the either the Socialists or the Legionaries are, who are regarded as trouble makers.\nSeeing the moment, they've now made their move, taking advantage of the chaos to impose a military state on Bulgaria!"
krg_bul.25.a: "Don't Pack your Case, Run!"

krg_bul.26.t: "Chaos across the country."
krg_bul.26.d: "With the remnant of the government, the Zveno junta, and the Legionaries all angry and seizing their arms, chaos has fallen over Bulgaria.\nThe Tsar must look out of the window of the Vrana Palace and weep as his people go to war with one another, in a three-sided war.\nWe thought the Balkan War was a disaster, but it seems like there was worse yet waiting for us."
krg_bul.26.a: "Woe... woe is us!"
krg_bul.26.b: "To arms comrades!"
krg_bul.26.c: "For the Leader!"

krg_bul.27.t: "The New Legionary Government"
krg_bul.27.d:  "Having swept into the power with a democratic mandate, the Legions can finally start to make their imprint on the nation. However, the OSPB are claiming that the vote was rigged by pro-rightist forces to deny the liberation of the workers from the Monarchy and are agitating against the government.\nThere are a couple of actions we can take to deal with the threat they pose - either go after Chervenkov, their leader, or actively strengthen the regime against the inevitable red terror."
krg_bul.27.a: "Lay down the guns in hidden places and prepare."
krg_bul.27.b: "Kill Chervenkov, that red swine!"

krg_bul.28.t: "Revolutionaries March On Sofia"
krg_bul.28.d: "In a scene reminiscent of olden times, columns of OSPB revolutionaries have marched on the capital in order to overthrow the government.\nThe police and army, such as they are, have been deployed to manage and contain them, but there are some concerns about who they are really loyal to, and the Legions from other cities are unable to make it to the capital in time."
krg_bul.28.a: "The Revolution Succeeds!"
krg_bul.28.b: "The army beat the revolutionaries!"

krg_bul.30.t: "Monarchist-Legionary Civil War"

krg_bul.31.t: "Legionaries Consolidate Control"
krg_bul.31.d: "After many hard fought battles, and some ignominious defeats too, the Zveno are on the run. The Legions have managed to put the mindless advocates of tradition down. Bulgaria will go into the future as a new kind of nation, and the Legions will free the nation from the shackles imposed on it."
