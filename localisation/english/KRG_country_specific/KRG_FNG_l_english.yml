 ### Political Parties ###
 FNG_authoritarian_socialist_party: "NDUA"
 FNG_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "§ANortheast Democratic United Army§! \n\n§LChina has an old saying: the leading bird gets shot first. The fate of §ANortheastern Anti-Japanese United Army§! proved that right. It was the first organized resistance behind Japanese lines, the first to start infighting among all resistance, and the first to take over formerly occupied lands. Thus, it was always targeted, first by the retaliatory rural clearance of the Kwantung Army, then line struggles within their own ranks, and later by Yang Yuting's encirclement campaigns. Reforming into the §ANortheast Democratic United Army§!, it was shattered and pursued to the remote mountains, many of which were within the Changbai Demilitarized Zone, neglecting concerns of Beijing and Guangzhou on violating the Second Treaty of Shimonoseki.§!"
 FNG_radical_socialist_party: "Northern NRA"
 FNG_radical_socialist_party_long: "§RNational Revolutionary Army - North China Military District§!\n\n§LThe NRA has a significant presence in northern China in the shape of group armies only nominally under Beyang's National Pacification Army: Xu Xiangqian and Wei Lihuang's §R18th Group Army§! in Chahar and northern Hebei, §R19th§! in Shandong mountains led by Su Yu and Wang Yaowu, and Southern Henan's §R20th§! led by Chen Geng and Chen Ta-ching.  The NRA veterans, Federalist \"Northward Cadres,\" and newly empowered tenant farmers attached to their respective revolutionary base areas were the backbone of guerilla warfare behind Japanese lines, preventing their rural resource extraction and disrupting their logistics. Beijing accused them of prioritizing expansion and preservation more than active resistance. If tension arises, they will not hesitate to stab Beiyang directly.§!"
 FNG_social_democrat_party: "NSDP"
 FNG_social_democrat_party_long: "§SThe New Social Democratic Party§! \n\n §L§SNSDP§! is a loose alliance of former New Chinese Empire Reform Association members, former Kuomintang moderates, and Federalist old guards against Chen Qiyou. It attempted to cooperate with workers, peasants and capitalists to build a social democratic China, despite recognizing the power of the warlords, bureaucrats, and gentry while attempting to cooperate with workers, peasants and capitalists. Viewed as puppets by their former comrades to the south, the §SNSDP§! had little influence on the Beiyang political scene and Chinese society."
 FNG_revolutionary_republican_party: "Kuomintang"
 FNG_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "§3Kuomintang - North China Bureau§! \n\n§LThe §3Kuomintang§!, or Nationalist Party of China, is well known for its long-term struggles during the National Revolution, the Qing Restoration, and the Imperial Collapse. In the interwar era following the failed Northern Expedition, the party scattered: Soong Ching-ling's Provisional Action Committee (PAC) established Jiangxi-Fujian National Revolutionary Base Area in the dense forests and mountains, combining revolutionary ideals with grassroot rural movement praxis, while the central committee evacuated to Paris, creating the pro-Internationale Reorganized Comrades Association. The more nationalistic right-wing worked with southwestern military strongmen to bide their time.\n\nAfter the Five Provinces War, the PAC reinforced their local dominance due to adaptation to Chinese realities. Distancing itself from Paris and London in favor of the Jiangxi-Fujian experience of mass line, peasant associations and democratic united front, the new §3Kuomintang§! was nicknamed "margarine syndicalist" by their Internationale comrades. \n\nWen Ying-Hsing, a retired NRA general with Beiyang ties, is Kuomintang's voice in the parliament, while actual revolutionary activities were conducted by Nie Rongzhen's §3North China Bureau§!.§!"
 FNG_social_liberal_party: "CDL"
 FNG_social_liberal_party_long: "§OChina Democratic League§!\n\n§LA loose political coalition founded during the second Sino-Japanese war by liberal intellectuals, guilds socialists and chambers of commerce from all over China, CDL as a party had never been as tight-knit as Kuomintang. The party is politically diverse in nature, with some admiring socialism and progressivism while others are conservative classical liberals who are wary of Guangzhou's far-left tendency.\n\nThe northern branch of the §OCDL§! is critical of the Beiyang Government and its indefinite suspension of the 1923 constitution, thus was often targeted by Sheng Shicai's secret police. But no matter how many disputes within and without the party, §OCDL§! will always be committed to building a Chinese democracy that can truly empower the people.§!"
 FNG_market_liberal_party: "NDCA"
 FNG_market_liberal_party_long: "§INational Democratic Construction Association§!\n\n§LSince the end of the Qing Dynasty, the development of Chinese national enterprises had been fraught with obstacles: fierce competition from the unrestricted inflow of foreign goods, internal political turmoils, predatory political system, and scarcity of factors of production such as land, capital, and labor. Some reluctantly dedicated themselves to developing Chinese industry, while others became compradors and speculators. Ironically, the total war against Japan allowed them to grow. Moving to western provinces such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, Chinese businesses enjoyed the absence of foreign competitors, intense wartime demands for import substitution, and the protection of military authorities. After the war ended, capitalists across China formed a new party - §INational Democratic Construction Association§!(NDCA) - to represent their interests. Led by vocational educator and industrialist Huang Yanpei, the §INDCA§! comprises industrial magnates across the country. Staunchly advocating infant industry protection, import substitution strategy, and functional market, the party was divided politically. A faction led by Chang Kia-ngau, Lu Zuofu, and H. H. Kung attempted to adapt to the southern tripartite state-cooperative-private mixed economy. In contrast, the conservatives, led by Qian Yongming, Wu Dingchang, and J. Pincuet Fu supported the Beiyang government. As a result, the §INDCA§! kept swinging between both sides and will cooperate with any political force that would safeguard capitalist interests.§!"
 FNG_social_conservative_party: "China Recovery Party"
 FNG_social_conservative_party_long: "§ZChina Recovery Party§!\n\n§LChina is theoretically a liberal democracy under the guidance of the 1923 constitution, and §ZZhonghua Guangfudang§!, or China Recovery Party, is China's freely and fairly elected ruling party. None of them are real. \n\nRecovery Party is a loose alliance of generals, politicians, oligarchs, and bureaucrats supporting the establishment, functioning as an extension of the executive branch rather than an autonomous political organization, running on bribery, backroom deals, and coercion. As the civil facade of the military regime, Guangfudang is notorious for corruption and disorganization, with little formal structure, discipline, or ideological leaning. §!"
 FNG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Staff College Clique"
 FNG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "§gStaff College Clique§!\n\n§LAfter the demise of the old warlords such as Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin, Beiyang's fragmented political patronage system based on region, family, or education also disintegrated. Traditional ties gradually give way to personalistic authorities of charismatic leaders with clear agendas. \n\nZhang Xueliang's faction is known as the §gStaff College Clique§! Most members were not graduates of the Army Staff College in Beijing. Instead, it includes his inner circle of cronies, bureaucrats loyal to Zhang's father and son, and oligarchs in Zhang's spoil network. Their influence and unity relied heavily on the political legacy of the deceased Zhang Zuolin. Lacking his father's political maneuvering and authority to control the rising military and political strongmen, the Young Marshal struggles to control this increasingly disunited camarilla. Faced with gradually depleting political capital and the increasing popularity of Yang Yuting, Zhang had found a way to maintain his authority without relying on the military or his father at all costs."
 FNG_paternal_autocrat_party: "Shikan Clique"
 FNG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "§lShikan Clique§!\n\n§LAfter the demise of the old warlords such as Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin, Beiyang's fragmented political patronage system based on region, family or education also disintegrated. Traditional ties are gradually giving way to personalistic authorities of charismatic leaders with clear agendas. \n\nChief of General Staff Yang Yuting's faction was known as the §lShikan Clique§!. This name does not imply that all its members graduated from the Japanese Army Cadet School(known as Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japanese), but generals and bureaucrats of different backgrounds, excluded from Zhang Dynasty's inner circle due the absence of personal ties. Influential in the military, they resented Zhang Xueliang's cronyism, advocating for formalizing political institutions by total reforms away from the Zhang dynasty.§!"
 FNG_national_populist_party: "Comrades' Association"
 FNG_national_populist_party_long: "§rAnti-Japanese Comrades' Association§!\n\n§LAfter the demise of the old warlords such as Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin, Beiyang's fragmented political patronage system based on region, family, or education also disintegrated. Traditional ties gradually give way to personalistic authorities of charismatic leaders with clear agendas. Faced with Yang Yuting's dominance in the army, Zhang Xueliang has an ace in the hole: Sheng Shicai. As a subordinate of Zhang Xueliang's mentor Guo Songling, Sheng was Zhang Dynasty's most trusted black glove. He single-handedly transformed the Peking Military and Political Execution Office from a negligible and disrepaired department to China's most efficient intelligence agency, with a fruitful record of intelligence operations against Japan and eliminating the Zhang family's political enemies. His political faction, the §rAnti-Japanese Comrades' Association§!, was often perceived as a branch of the Staff College Clique. This apparent "club" brought together young generals who were highly dissatisfied with the Shikan Clique's dominance in the military, radical scholars of the Zhanguoce School devoted to German militarism philosophies, hard-line nationalists of the Young China Party, and even remnants of Kuomintang's China Reconstruction Society who had escaped purges after their unsuccessful cup. The Zhang dynasty attempted to use the power of Sheng Shicai to balance the Shikan Clique and southern radicals, but Sheng Shicai would never be satisfied with being a lapdog of a playboy.§!"

 FNG_idea_victory_over_japan_desc: "Shimonoseki, a place of shame to all patriotic Chinese citizens, was chosen as the site of signing the peace treaty agreed upon last year. We told the public that the war ended in a decisive Chinese victory, but everybody knows the truth: they can fight as long as they want with the entire Asia in hand. They agreed to peace talks not because they couldn't beat us, but because the expense of war wasn't worth it. To add injury to insult, we have no choice but to compensate Japan, refrain from future anti-Japanese activities, and demilitarize our borders with Japan, in exchange for their military withdrawal. Since our southern friends also signed the treaty, we must remind them to pay their share."
 FNG_idea_power_struggle: "Power Struggle in Beijing"
 FNG_idea_power_struggle_desc: "Since the Xinhai Revolution, factionalism had always been a major drawback to the Republic, leading to endless bickering, regionalism, and at worst, warlordism. Our revered Grand Marshal, Zhang Zuolin, responding to the people's call to end such nonsense, had always aimed to create a strong and effective government with him as the benevolent, unifying supreme leader. However, his recent death is casting shadows on the fragile unity under the five-colored banner. Now, the Beijing government is engulfed in a power struggle between Zhang Xueliang, Zuolin's first son and legitimate heir, and marshal Yang Yuting, the revered war hero and Zuolin's right-hand man. Should the disagreements run out of control, the southern rebels and... certain shadier figures roaming in the political dark chambers, are almost certain to capitalize."
 FNG_idea_high_skies_faraway_emperors: "High Skies, Faraway Emperors"
 FNG_idea_high_skies_faraway_emperors_desc: "Despite being the legitimate Republic of China, our administrative method is no different than the model adopted by emperors and scholar-officials of old, largely relying on a loose network of local patronage, be it local strongmen, patriarchal clans, gentry, oligarchs, private armies, guilds or gangs. The influence of the central government is limited to major cities scattered throughout the North China Plain and Manchuria. Rather than a full-fledged state, we look more like a patchwork of semi-independent fiefdoms. To tackle corruption, rural decay, incompetent governance, organized crimes, and opioid addiction, we must take substantial and decisive political willpower into state-building."
 FNG_idea_the_red_ghost: "The Red Ghost"
 FNG_idea_the_red_ghost_desc: "During the power vacuums following the Japanese invasion, the radicals had exponentially expanded their influence in the rural areas. The 18th Group Army led by Xu Xiangqian had taken root among the desperate peasants on the war-torn North China Plain and the Loess Plateau, while the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army roams our homeland - the forests of Manchuria. Controlled by the South, we reluctantly cooperated with them during the war, but now they are becoming a thorn in our side. Starting from their rural base areas, they are spreading their vile thoughts, agitating ungrateful peasants against the very foundation of our nation. We have to prepare both hands: working out a solution by talking with the masterminds in Guangzhou, and preparing an encirclement campaign should the situation allow it."

 FNG_military_modifier: "Baoding Traditions"
 FNG_military_modifier_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy is both the cradle of our mighty force and our gateway to modern warfare. Established by Yuan Shikai in 1906, its alumni had played decisive roles in the Chinese political and military playground. Baoding is the name of military tradition, quality, profession, and prestige, while its cacotype in the south rattles on revolutionary nonsense to peasant recruits. The mudleg partisans in the south are no match to our professional officers educated by disciplined orthodox military doctrines. However, our officers are tactically rigid and politically unreliable, not to mention their notorious nepotism and corruption. We must abandon our warlord past and reform our army to fit the modern standard, and only by Baoding we can introduce professionalism and discipline to our officers."
 FNG_development_modifier: "Our Development at a Glance"
 FNG_development_modifier_desc: "China had long been a developmental backwater even before the war: a public colony for the great powers, a marsh of ignorance and numbness, and a country half a century behind the global standard. The prosperity in the Qing decade was merely a semi-colonial system that only benefitted a few warlords and compradors, contributing little to the human development of the majority of the population. To add insult to injury, the myriad civil wars and the subsequent Japanese invasion terminated all hopes of peaceful development. As the dust settled, we finally have the opportunity to drag the Sick Man of Asia to the 20th century. With blood, sweat, wisdom and necessary outside assistance, we will build our country into what it should have been."

 
 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ZHANG_XUELIANG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 3rd, 1901\nHaicheng, Fengtian, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThere's an unspoken rule in many Asian societies - only the most powerful positions are reserved for elders and elders alone. That is until Zhang Xueliang was born. Known to many as the "Young Marshal", he is one of the youngest generals that ever walked the Earth. Born to a military family, it was no coincidence that he decided to follow the footsteps of his father, Zhang Zhoulin, to become a soldier, a particularly competent one at that. He was a rising star, the perfect successor to take his father's place on the pedestal.\n\nYet, even a soldier can break in an instant.\n\nGuo Songling, Zhang's mentor and friend, was executed by Yang Yuting. The "Young Marshal" was gone. He succumbed to a life of booze, whores, and opium. What was once China's youngest and most successful general is seemingly lost, replaced by a man who can't face his fear and his inner demons, who decided to drown himself in phantom pleasures in an effort to escape his true destiny.\n\nFortunately, redemption is ripe for the taking.\n\nAs Japan sent its waves of soldiers to punish the so-called "rebellious state" of Fengtian, Xueliang saw an opportunity to redeem him. With the help of his adjutant, Lu Zhengcao, he was able to free himself from the chains of vices. One by one, the Japanese fell as they witness the return of the "Young Marshal", bolder and fiercer than ever. When his father died, he inherited the position that he was destined to hold - leader of the Beiyang Government. But the newly minted Xueliang has a troubled time ahead.\n\nThe Guangzhou Government, led by the Kuomintang and the Federalists, have called our rule as nothing but autocratic and corrupt, seeing it as unworthy to lead China. Negotiations are underway, but that is just the exterior. Many factions want Zhang out of the picture, with Generals already plotting under his shadow. Many things can happen, but one thing is certain:\n\nFortune favors the bold, and bold action is needed."
 POLITICS_YANG_YUTING_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\n1886\nFaku County, Fengtian, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nHaving the distinction as one of the best generals in all of China, in addition to his position within Zhang Zuolin's inner circle, Yang Yuting is a legendary figure revered in Beijing and beyond.\n\nYang was considered to be a Japanese asset within Fengtian, even cited to be a potential leader of a collaborator regime. However, his allegiances quickly flipped when the war with Japan actually began. As the de-facto leader of the once pro-Japan Shikan Faction, he tried to rally as many members to the Old Marshal's cause, staying loyal to his country over his benefactors. Through his efforts, many former Shikan Faction members followed his footsteps, and stood against the Japanese invaders. Those who did defect were met with violent retribution, with Yang often personally executing those collaborators who were once closest to him.\n\nWhen the war was over, the United Front stood on top. Yang had secured himself a legacy as one of the best generals in China, and he had become an extremely popular figure. But his long-term rivalry with Zhang Xueliang was fiercer than ever. A rivalry with its routes in the Guo Songling Revolt over 20 years ago, the Old Marshal's passing let this old bad-blood dominate Beiyang politics, both sides using increasingly underhanded tactics to gain any advantage they could.\n\nBut the Yang Clique has prevailed, with the Young Marshal banished to exile and his followers converted, subdued or destroyed. His victory represents an entrenchment of classic warlord-politics within Beijing, with military dominance and heavy de-centralisation. Yang now holds the key to China, but it's one he must work to keep. His supporters expect a swift victory over Guangzhou, and if this doesn't come then the 'Second Zhuge' may face a dire fate..."

  ### Events ###
 krg_fng.1.t: "An Annoying Uncle"
 krg_fng.1.d: "Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin's memorial meeting was held in Biyun Temple, where Dr.Sun Yat-sen's coffin once stayed. The press wandered outside the monastery, surging towards the black iron gate only to be stopped by the police. As the host, Zhang Xueliang greeted attendants in black, most of whom he recognized and dealt with. Even Guangzhou sent their regards: Du Chongyuan from KMT and Yan Baohang from CZGP stood at the very end of the courtyard, both were once his subordinates.\n\nThere was no sorrow, no gongs, and drums, no buzzing mantras, no weeps, only salutes fired as the hearse slowly passed by.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, today we mourn the passing of a great leader and a father of the Chinese people...\" Zhang Xueliang's eulogy was short. He spoke as if he was not Zuolin's son, but his close comrade and colleague. At the end of the funeral, Xueliang did not leave. He dismissed the undertakers and guards, whispering to his beloved father, and bid him farewell alone.  \n\n\"My condolences, kid.\" A familiar, rough voice came from behind. It was marshal Yang Yuting, whose messy dress sharply contrasted with Xueliang's black suit. Xueliang nearly frowned: he had ordered everyone to leave him alone and wait outside, why was Yuting here? Who did he think he was exactly? The president and the heir of the Grand Marshal?\n\nYuting had always acted like an annoying elder and guardian - a mere disguise for his ambition towards the presidency. As Zuolin's old comrade and second-in-command, Yuting had always considered himself the rightful heir, ahead of his son. Annoyed by Yuting, Xueliang only responded with a glare to the marshal, who reciprocated after being rebuffed."
 krg_fng.1.a: "There cannot be two suns in the sky."

 krg_fng.2.t: "The Bickering Funeral Committee"
 krg_fng.2.d: "Zuolin's inner circle gathered at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai, trying to solve critical controversies at the funeral. But everyone was clear that this was merely a wrestle for legitimacy between Zhang's Staff College Clique and Yang's Shikan Clique.\n\n\"As a loving father of all Chinese people, we should bury him in the capital, Beijing.\"  Zhang Xueming, Xueliang's younger brother, suggested on behalf of the Staff College Clique,  \"Beijing was the capital of several imperial dynasties and had a 'royal atmosphere' from Fengshui perspective. By burying the marshal here, we can show our determination to unify the country and restore its glory.\"\n\n\"Where are our roots? In the Northeast! The marshal also wished to return to his roots when he was alive. It would be perfect to return him to his hometown: Haicheng, Fengtian."\n\n"The transportation of the coffin and the ceremonies are very costly, and the conditions in Fengtian are unstable. I am afraid that the delay in the burial will be too long."\n\n"Xueming!" Yang Yuting slapped the table, "I hope you can respect the Old Marshal's wishes!"\n\n"The will of the Old Marshal?" Xueming grinned coldly, "You think you are him,  Marshal Yang? " \n\n"How insolent...How dare you speak to me like that? Marshal had entrusted you, brothers, to me ......\"" Quiet, Gentlemen." Xueliang cooled the bicker down - Yuting was too influential in the Army to be confronted at the moment.\n\nBut he was not the President, not yet. The current President noticed with satisfaction as people gazed upon him, eyeing his final decision to end the dispute. After all, they all know who's in charge.\n\n"We all hold our best plans to remember the passing of the beloved father of China. " Zhang Xueliang looked around with the sorrow of a filial son on his face. "However, the old marshal can only be buried in one place." Zhang Xueliang pondered for nearly two seconds in total silence, ignoring Yang's stare before speaking up."
 krg_fng.2.a: "\"Xueming is right. He should be buried in Beijing.\""
 krg_fng.2.b: "\"Yuting is right. He should return to his roots.\""

 krg_fng.3.t: "Laying the Groundwork"
 krg_fng.3.d: "The joint meeting for the military reform of the NPA was held at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai, with the 19-star flag and the five-color army insignia of the NPA hanging in front of the conference room.\n\n "For ages, we have relied on imagination for training and robbery for logistics. To progress into the 20th century, we must whip discipline and unity into our Army. Some of us are clinging to the old traditions as if we are still some warlords - it's not going to happen." Zhang Xueliang gave Yang Yuting a grim look, "Second, further promote formalization and speed up the codification of troop drill codes. "\n\n"I agree with you on discipline and formalization, Mr.President." Marshal Yang Yuting coughed, "But our boys can't drill if they starve and can't fight if they have no ammunition. To effectively carry out duty and training tasks and lay reform groundworks, we should renovate our joint logistics headquarter, ending violent procurement, wasteful storage, and corrupt distribution. "\n\n Zhang Xueliang nearly frowned. He knew that Yang was right. A logistics department will do, but not under Yang's control. The military under Yang is already too autonomous, and a reformed logistic system will further ensure his grasp on the Army, leaving little room for Zhang to balance between powerful generals with selective funding and political favors. \n\nHis eyes swept across the hall, seeing only dozens of poker faces. Everyone here was cautious about expressing their attitude except those from the inner circles of both cliques. One mainly unrelated person was Sheng Shicai, director of the Military and Political Executive Committee. Seeing dozens of eyes on him, the new President realized that he must decide. Last week he submitted a radical proposal of prioritizing nationalistic indoctrination and political organization of the military, catering Xueliang's concerns of discipline and loyalty. Xueliang disliked its totalistic elements, but it's obviously better than Yang turning the Army into his personal Kingdom."
 krg_fng.3.a: "\"As I have said, drill codes are our top priorities.\""
 krg_fng.3.b: "\"I agree with Marshal Yang. Logistics matter most.\""
 krg_fng.3.c: "\"How about we focus on something more fundamental?""

 krg_fng.4.t: "Unhealthy Teutophilia"
 krg_fng.4.d: "\"Sir,\" General Lü Zhengcao reported on the phone, \"I have received multiple complaints on General Zhao Dong's 'Eisenblut Jugendarmee' interfering military operations.\" He emphasized that absurd name with a clear tone of disgust. Zhang skimmed through the report on his desk, \"That's all?\"\n\n\"Mr. President,\" Zhengcao sighed, \"They had been making too much noise lately: lynching, harassment, firefights with friendlies. Their misbehavior seriously affected the government's reputation and jeopardized social stability. "\n\n"Patriotism is a good thing. Just Keep these boys in line, general. That's it." The Eisenblut Jugendsarmee was a paramilitary organization under the command of the Military and Political Executive Office and, by extension, the Comrades Association. However, many of its members were from the Youth China Party, including its commander, Zhao Dong. Both are too useful to Zuolin and Xueliang.\n\n" I am not in the place to care about the politics behind Comrade Association, sir, but the thought that you do care compels me to report this to you." Zhang smiled faintly, partly due to Zhengcao's loyalty, somewhat his pointless enthusiasm. As his previous adjutant, Lü Zhengcao was one of the few generals under his command who did not care about politics. He was unbiased in his political stance, hated nepotism and corruption within the NPA, and was a decent man in his style. That is acceptably troublesome. Things had been there for a reason.\n\n"Well, do you have a plan?" asked Xueliang, "If you are not disbanding them, you may either give them a place in our command chain or reassign them to policing duties. The final decision is in your hands."\n\nZhang thought for a while and made his decision:"
 krg_fng.4.a: "\"One country, one army."
 krg_fng.4.b: "\"They can help in dealing with certain...subversive elements.\""

 krg_fng.5.t: "An Unexpected Meeting"
 krg_fng.5.d: "As a former member of the Qing establishment, general secretary Zuo Sunsheng of the Youth China Party knew that the Beiyang government disliked him. He led the China Democratic League, a loose coalition of liberal opposition parties against the Beiyang government, standing firmly against military tyranny and radical subversion. He was obviously on Sheng Shicai's watchlist, but he did not expect the government to react so quickly. \n\nSome men in grey dragged him out of his office and threw him into a Maybach limo which took him to Zhongnanhai. President Zhang Xueliang was already waiting for him in a parlor and offered him a glass of German sparkling wine.\n\n "Mr. Zuo, I am honored to meet you. Sorry for my abrupt 'invitation.'" Xueliang took a sip from his glass and looked playfully at the bubbles rising in the slender glass. "Mr. President, you must be joking." Shunsheng gave a nervous smile as Zhang handed him a glassful of wine, "I'm the one who's honored to meet you."\n\nThe President shook his head, "Appreciated, but let's not waste our time on formalities - we are both busy." He lowered his glass, "The political maneuvers are crystal clear to you." Shunsheng realized that Zhang was asking him for a favor, probably related to his rivalry with Yang. He was right. Xueliang elaborated on his concerns about the current stratocratic establishment of the Beiyang Government. He vaguely mentioned the matter of Yang Yuting's Shikan Clique, the discord among the ranks, about how Yang's autocratic tendencies will threaten his "controlled democratization" agenda.\n\nZhang revealed some compelling messages unbeknownst to outsiders, which means that the President extended an olive branch to him - and the opposition behind him."Your influence on the legislature will ensure a smooth political transition..." "Mr. President, I can't decide for the CDL without the consensus of...." Shunsheng listened very carefully as his heart raced. \n\n"That wasn't what you said in 4 East Anfu Hutong, your residence, during a meeting in CDL's standing committee last Thursday... Not to mention two-thirds of all CDL members are from YCP. I am confident that you will make things through your league. " Shunsheng felt the cold fruity liquid sliding across his throat. "
 krg_fng.5.a: "\"Sorry, Mr. President. Your request is beyond my ability.\""
 krg_fng.5.b: "\"I will try to sway my comrades.\""

 krg_fng.6.t: "A Fish on the Cutting Board"
 krg_fng.6.d: "\"A deal with Zhang? I have no idea why Zuo rejected that bargain?" Chen Qitian, the party's theorist, contemptuously took a sip of Shaoxing Huangjiu," Just because our wise general secretary values democracy and alliance with some leftists," "we gave up an excellent opportunity. "\n\nVice chairman Li Huang filled his glass and shook his head, " Now Zhang had everything. Zuo's house was bugged. CDL's done, and so are we. Other parties are either on their way to Guangzhou or kowtowing to our great president."\n\n"We can always find some new backing." General Zhao Dong, YCP's voice in the military, proposed." Whom? Yang? You are mad?" Qitian shook his head. "\n\n"You know that old superior of mine...Marshal Sheng Shicai. He is interested in our patriotic cause. He envisioned a patriotic and revolutionary government that could represent people's will. I am sure you will like him. He wanted me to tell you that we will be given more reasonable positions. "\n\n"We do have some pleasant experiences cooperating in Xi'an. I like the way his MPEO deal with syndies and gunnies. He's got some interesting political thoughts. "\n\n"Feasible," Chen Qitian frowned, "But what about Zuo and Zeng?"\n\n"He said that as long as you nod, these two will no longer be a problem." the general gulped his glassful of wine in one sitting."
 krg_fng.6.a: "\"We don't have much of choice.\""

 krg_fng.7.t: "Discords among the Opposition"
 krg_fng.7.d: "\"CONDEMNING the arbitrary domination of league affairs by few individuals from one particular party...RECOMMENDS limiting the power of the Secretary-General...FURTHER INSTRUCTS to dilute the central member of a certain party by reforming...."\n\nThe members of the Youth Party in the conference hall were dumbfounded as chairman Huang Yanpei of the China Democratic League read the joint motion of four parties. YCP's chairman Zeng Qi reacted quickly, "What do you mean by this? Is that a coup?" He glared at the chief sponsor of the motion, Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, who responded calmly, "Other member parties are fed up with your total dictation on the League's affairs. Your cadre decides everything for us, holding standing committee meetings in Zuo Shunsheng's house without our presence. Taking five out of nine League seats in the People's Political Consultative Conference was too far. Who do you think you are?"\n\nThe Youth China Party was the first and most powerful party in the Democratic League, far outnumbering the rest combined, and it even had military power. Its leader Zuo Sunsheng also served as CDL's secretary-general, controlling the League's central committee since its foundation in 1944. Moreover, the conservative and hard-line image of the YCP did not fit in with the liberal tendencies of the rest.\n\n"YCP is our ally, not our overlord. This statement ignited a tsunami of uproar. " Zhang Junmai said sternly, while Zeng Qi sneered back, "We were elected through the democratic process rather than deals in smoke-filled rooms!" "And you dare to accuse us of backroom politics?" Someone roared in a loud voice, "He mingled with Zhang Xueliang and leaked our confidentials to him!"\n\nAs the discontent within the CDL against the YCP intensified, four other parties within the League were determined to propose a final solution at today's provisional national congress of the CDL. Their motion and voting coalition effectively reduced the proportion of YCP members in the Central Committee from two-thirds to one-sixth, rendering them unable to stop Junmai's killing draft resolution. Zeng and Zuo declared in a rage that the YCP will quit the League, leaving the hall with the entire party."

There was little ceremony in the matter, and aside from a few photographers and a couple of press-men the event was scarcely attended, despite being signed on the same site as the first treaty of Shimonoseki, 53 years ago.\n\nAs the event ended, the clouds overhead burst and it began to rain. Nobody stayed to talk past a brief exchange of pleasantries, and the Chinese left to their respective governments while the Japanese were left with their copy of the treaty and a sense of wonderment at how these people had managed to bring them to these terms."

Our stance on this incident is clear: the Chinese Central government will always take a firm stand against any attempt to split and destabilize our nation. We deem Guangzhou behind such reasonable,dishonest and unacceptable acts, trying to undermine the Xi'an agreement and pulling the rug out from under us before the constitution is drawn up. The declaration has been announced and we have shown our attitude. Now, we will wait for Guangzhou's.\n\nHowever, most of our advisors are pessimistic about the outcome. During the Xi'an negotiations, we failed to reach consensus on most of the critical issues on national reunification: military nationalization, political democratization and social reform. We had hoped that they could soften their stance and stay reasonable on such radical and pointless demands.  We have tried to persuade them, and we have unfortunately failed. After the Xi'an negotiation, both Guangzhou and us did not stop military buildups, getting fully prepared for the worst.  Therefore, to no one's surprise, the treaty has already become a worthless paper. It was them who disregarded the sincerity for the negotiation, and we didn't expect a seamless and peaceful reunification with this treaty. And the fact that these radicals refused to comply to the agreement verified our worst expectation. So glad we have prepared for a plan B."

 ### Coup
 krg_fng.101.t: "Premonitions."
 krg_fng.101.d: "Since the imperial times, political gossips had been among old Beijingers' favourite hobbies: boasting their\"connections\", exaggerating for every hint of wind, making use of the topic, and bluffing the onlookers. It's not about concrete facts, but premonitions.\n\nIf the newspapers started to scold each other about whether Zhang Xueliang or Chen Yi was responsible for the Tianjin tragedy,  that was a premonition.\n\nIf the Shanghai stock market suddenly plunged, that was a premonition.\n\nIf the parliamentarians busy attacking, bribing or framing each others suddenly united, that was a premonition.\n\nIf Yan Xishan's spokesman refused to comment on none-routine military maneuvers near Zhili borders, that was a premonition.\n\nIf trains of Northeast Security Command kept passing through Shanhaiguan, that was a premonition.\n\nIf Yu Xuezhong's Shandong garrisons were on high alert but stopped their constant frictions with Wang Yaowu's base area partisans, that was a premonition.\n\nIf the Military and Political Executive Office raised the quota for capturing \"subversive elements\" , that was a premonition.\n\nIf nothing happened in a tranquil afternoon except two retired general Wang Huaiqing and Yang Sen sharing a pack of Hataman in the toilet of a tripe restaurant near Houhai, that would probably be a sign too. \n\nThese premonitions would only herald one thing: the charade between President Zhang and Marshal Yang was ending. Several forces within the Beiyang government - be it local strongmen, bureaucrats or red hat capitalists - were beginning to choose sides and place their bets. The goulash of bribery, lies, hatred and deception known as politics was being seasoned with a traditional ingredient:"

 krg_fng.102.d: "Yang Yuting gazed from the window of the War Ministry building in Tieshizi Hutong as gunfires rumbled across the city, like thunders rolling afar. Zhang Xueliang's Staff College Clique troops and allies fed with silver bullets stroke first, but the marshal was quicker. The public rage following the Tianjin massacre turned from Chen Yi, who ordered the shooting, to the president. Yang seized the opportunity - people wanted this incompetent tyrant removed, and he will be the one doing it.\n\nAs Zhang Xueliang and his inner circle were shivering in their Zhongnanhai bunker, the only obstacle before Yang Capital Defense Command led by General Lü Zhengcao, Xuelliang's former adjutant. Yang knew this stoic brick of a man - as he expected, Lü expectedly responded to Yang's persuasion phone by telling him to stay put and watch him roll in panzers and crush Yang's rebels to hell. Outgunning Lü, Yang knew it was just a matter of time before eradicating such futile resistance.\n\nTelephones kept ranging, asking for further commands on the final offensive. The news was pouring in from all sides: Lü Zhengcao's defenders, reinforced by outer provincial troops, had repulsed the coup forces. The siege of several strategic points in the city, especially the crucial radio station and local garrison headquarters. Yang felt his cold sweat run down his face, and all the officers in the room were as nervous as he was.\n\nRestraining his shivers, the marshal turned on the radio himself: "This is your president Zhang Xueliang. Please stay at home and stay calm. A small group of malicious warlords puppeted by foreign subversive elements is conspiring against the Republic of China ......" A few seconds later, thunderous explosions rolled across the street, followed by the sound of windows shattering and the steps of officers rushing for the armory. "

The news was pouring in from all sides: Chang'an Avenue was cleared, and the parliamentarians were detained in the National Assembly outside Xuanwumen. The gendarmes arrested protesters against the coup but "accidentally" spared those anti-Zhang ones, especially those leftists - a tacit agreement with Guangzhou. Zhang's fate remained unknown, but presumably dead.\n\nIt's about time. Yang ordered to turn on the radio. A shivering female voice - Yang wondered if a pistol was being held to her head - was warning citizens to stay calm. The marshal smiled when he heard his pre-recorded message:"

 krg_fng.104.t: "Timely Reinforcements"
 krg_fng.104.d: "After his victory, Yang was confused by various anomalies: unidentified shootouts in the northern Deshengmen Gate, unwarned seizure of Xijiao Airport, cut telephone lines, and jammed radio signals blinding his HQ. The intel was contradictory: syndies, Zhang loyalists, or - a possibility Yang especially feared - \"Eisenblut Freiwilligen,\" nationalist partisans of the Comrades Association led by the new star Zhao Dong, entered Beijing under the command of his superior, Sheng Shicai. Yang Yuting regretted underestimating Sheng's ambitions. He thought Sheng was Zhang's ass-kissing lapdog, using paramilitaries, secret police, and nationalist rhetoric to defend Zhang's interests. He thought Sheng wasn't even slightly able to fight a battle - only knowing how to torture students and bust unions.\n\nHe was right. The march of Sheng and Zhao was crushed by unexpected reinforcements from Daxing, led by an unexpected savior, Xie Ruchuan, his former junior at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, an apolitical figure known for his first shot against Japan in 1939. Hearing that name, Yang didn't know whether to rejoice or worry - Xie was a mysterious yet well-connected figure. Perhaps his prompt response was out of opportunism, or worse, to replace him?\n\nMuch to his surprise, Xie did not ask for wealth or position, instead briefed with a routine look: Sheng was found dead in his command truck before he could approach Zhongnanhai - with 32 7.92mm Kurzes in his body;  Zhao Dong, or what's left of him, was found in a watered crater created by an sFH 18/32 during a fruitless counteroffensive near the outskirt town of Fengtai.\n\n"How on earth did you respond so fast?" curiously asked Yang, realizing that Xie couldn't have known his plan."

He thought Sheng wasn't even slightly able to fight a battle - only knowing how to torture students and bust unions.\n\nIt was not until he received a hard buttstroke to the stomach and was dragged by the collar to Zhongnanhai Huairen Hall that Yang Yuting realized his big mistake. In addition to the guards in black, rows of generals and politicians tied up were thrown on the ground like logs, including at least three senior generals and five ex-primiers. Dressed in a plain Shaanxi cotton military uniform, Sheng Shicai welcomed the ex-marshal. Yang Yuting knew that Sheng Shicai hated him because he had killed Guo Songling, Sheng Shicai's mentor.\n\n"I am sorry about Guo...I was just obeying the old marshal's order..." Sheng responded his plead for mercy by a hard stomp on his face, crushing his nose bridge, before ordering the guards to drag those tied up dignitaries out. \n\n"Make it quick, you motherfucker." Hearing screams and intensive gunfire came from outside, Yang swore with agony. Sheng turned around, and finally spoke."

 krg_fng.106.d: "Seeing Sheng Shicai's guards appearing in Huairen Hall, Foreign Minister Ku Wei-Chun was confused, but Prime Minister Mo Teh-Hui was informed, avoiding eye contact with Sheng, who lit a cigarette disregarding the surroundings, checking his watch from time to time.\n\n Interior Minister Chang Yinhuai appeared at the door, nervously clutching a bulging bag of papers like an apologetic clerk, followed by the annoyed, stern marshal Yang. Unprepared, they instantly were pinned down and cuffed, pointed at by at least six box cannons.\n\nZhang Xueliang paced out from the side gate, \"Despite my repeated warnings, both of you and your pathetic clique continued to conspire against the government, collaborating with foreign subversives for your seizure of power. You are now removed from office along with your fellow accomplices.\" Feeling the muzzle against the back of his head, Yang mumbled hopelessly as if he had been awakened from a dream while Chang remained silent.\n\nThe president scanned around the room: the civilian members of the cabinet looked pale, but Sheng Shicai was excited, expecting the order of execution. Looking down upon the two men at his mercy, the president hesitated. For ages, he had been waiting to pay back the humiliation by these arrogant bastards and remind the old guards that he was no longer that playboy under the shadow of his warlord father but the unquestionable president of the Republic of China.\n\nThat's why he should not act however he want like a playboy or a warlord. Ignoring Sheng's disappointed face, he ordered the two under house arrest. When Yang and Chang were escorted into the Maybach, Zhang Xueliang almost fell to the ground in dismay."

 krg_fng.107.t: "The Showdown"
 krg_fng.107.d: "Decades later, when historians interviewed Zhang Xueliang at his villa in Dallas, he was still reminiscent of that distant afternoon when he was ousted. An elite commando squad loyal to Yang Yuting, led by General Li Zhenqing, stormed into his smoke-filled office in Fengze Garden, Zhongnanhai. Li showed him an arrest warrant from the general headquarters, accusing him of taking bribes, abuses of his power, deliberately leaking state secrets, and colluding with foreign subversives during the war. "General Headquarters? Which one? Who told you that?" Zhang remained calm, gesturing Li to piss off with his cigar at hand. \n\nOnly when hearing the names of half of the leading generals including Yang Yuting, did Zhang realize that he had been abandoned and betrayed. He demanded to see Yang until being shot by a loaded MP40. Li informed him that his "accomplices" of the Staff College Clique had been all under arrest or killed due to rejection of capture, except for Lü Zhengcao - who had disappeared a moment before his arrest.\n\nZhang Xueliang bowed his head, straightened his clothes, put his cigar in the ashtray, stood up slowly with both hands on the armrests of his chair, and turned his head in obedience. The soldier took his gray coat and hat from the coat rack, dressed him, and "escorted" him out of the office. His Maybach was parked in front of the gate, its heavy safety door like a bloody jaw.\n\nAs the car passed in front of Huairen Hall, Zhang Xueliang saw through the window Yang Yuting, Zou Zuohua, and Chang Yinhuai standing on the steps of the gate. He did not capture their expressions, not to mention defend himself in front of them. All he could do was sit silently in the middle of the back seat, waiting for the Maybach to take him to his fate."
