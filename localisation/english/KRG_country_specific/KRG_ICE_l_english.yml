ICE_danish_sovereignty: "De Jure Danish Sovereignty"
ICE_danish_sovereignty_desc: "During the 2nd Weltkrieg both Greenland and Iceland were occupied by Canada at Denmark's invitation to save them from a potential Syndicalist invasion. However, with Denmark squarely in Germany's sphere, and Canada not wanting to give Germany potential bases in the North Sea, Canada has continued the occupation indefinitely. In order to legitimize their occupation, Canada plans to organize an independence referendum for Iceland from Denmark and promptly admit them to the Accord, but the locals may not be cooperative...\n\nThe Icelandic and Danish governments cannot agree at the moment."

### Events ###
ice.0.t: "Iceland in 1948"
ice.0.d: "Since 1918, the Icelandic people have been able to elect their own officials within the limit of being in a Union with Denmark. During the Second Weltkrieg, a proposal was put forward to end the Union and both the Icelandic parliament and the Icelandic people voted in favour for the proposal. Despite this being the case, Denmark has insisted that the Kingdom of Denmark includes Iceland and that their declaration was merely a joke. Sveinn Björnsson, President of the self-proclaimed Republic of Iceland, has several times visited the late King Christian X in Denmark to plead their case for independence to no avail. With his death earlier last year, no visit has since been made to the new King of Denmark, Frederick IX."
ice.0.a: "Pack your bags!"

ice.100.t: "A Visit from Iceland"
ice.100.d: "[ICE.GetLeader] has traveled to Denmark all the way from Iceland to once more plead their case for an independent Iceland free from our rule. The King's father, Christian X, denied their independence, stating that \"a so-called Independent Iceland is no more independent than us Humans from Air.\" The King has plead to the Government to simply follow his father's advice of refusing their independence.\n\nA debate in Parliament has sparked confusion and divide on whether to grant their independence, or to anger the King. What is clear, however, is that a decision must be made and quickly!"
ice.100.a: "Grant Icelandic Independence."
ice.100.b: "The King is Right."

ice.101.t: "A Letter from Denmark"
ice.101.d: "Denmark has voted in favour of Icelandic Independence and the Union is officially dissolved."
ice.101.d2: "Denmark has deemed that Icelandic Independence should not be granted."
ice.101.d3: "Denmark sends us a congratulations on our Independence."
ice.101.a: "Three Hurrahs for Iceland!"
ice.101.a2: "Another Plea?"
ice.101.a3: "Three Hurrahs for Iceland!  "
ice.101.b: "For the Republic!"

ice.102.t: "Iceland Declares Independence"
ice.102.d: "In light of the recent visit by the President of Iceland, hearings were held in the Danish parliament on the issue of breaking the Union and granting independence to our former subjects. With a narrow margin in favour of the Republic of Iceland, the Rigsdag ratified agreements with Icelandic government, which subsequently announced its independence in a public declaration."
ice.102.d2: "Despite the fact that the recent negotiations between the President of the self-proclaimed Republic of Iceland and King Frederick IX concluded on a rather cold note, [ICE.GetLeader] still harbored hopes for a possible favorable outcome in the upcoming Riksdag hearings. However, reality proved to be far more disheartening, and the Danish government resolutely rejected any possibility of Iceland's independence. This, in turn, became yet another decisive factor for Iceland to sever its ties with Denmark.\n\nThe Icelandic President, disregarding the concerns expressed by observers in the matter of the deteriorating relationship between the two nations, announced the country's complete independence from Denmark in the early morning. The already bad relations between the former subjects and the crown have finally reached an impasse."
ice.102.a: "Send our Congratulations."
ice.102.b: "Demand it be Withdrawn!"

ice.103.t: "Denmark Demands Withdrawal"
ice.103.d: "Following our Declaration of Independence, Denmark has issued a warning that if we do not withdraw our declaration, consequences will be made!"
ice.103.a: "Withdraw our Declaration."
ice.103.b: "A Simple No!"

ice.104.t: "Iceland Rejects our Demands"
ice.104.d: "The Icelandic government has rejected our recent demands, declaring that \"they are no longer obey foreign monarchs and will determine their own fate from now on\". Although such an offhand response caused discontent both in the Riksdag and among the King himself, there has been a suggestion of a compromise that could ensure the preservation of our position while granting Iceland the long-awaited independence."
ice.104.a: "We're going to Iceland!" #Leads to War
ice.104.b: "Let's send them a Proposal." #Denmark has a proposal

ice.105.t: "The Danish Proposal"
ice.105.d: "In surprising turn of events, a proposal has shown up at the door of [ICE.GetLeader]. The so-called 'Danish Proposal' states that Denmark will allow the independence of Iceland as long as we do not joins the [CAN.GetFactionName] and allows their troops to be stationed on our territory."
ice.105.a: "A Irrefutable Proposal!" 
ice.105.b: "Refuse the Proposal." 

ice.106.t: "Iceland Rejects our Proposal"
ice.106.d: "Once again, Iceland has declined our offer. In spite of the concerted efforts of Danish government, a way out of the crisis has not been found. Amidst the ardent supporters of resolving such issues through military means, there has been a growing sentiment in favor of the declaration of war against the so-called Republic of Iceland, seeking to bring an end to this confrontation before it escalates into catastrophic consequences for us. However, among the supporters of Icelandic sovereignty, there are profound reservations regarding the prudence of instigating the war."
ice.106.a: "We're going to Iceland!" #Leads to War
ice.106.b: "Grant their Independence" #

ice.107.t: "Iceland Approves the Proposal"
ice.107.d: "Good news has come to us today - the Icelandic government has accepted our proposal, pledging to maintain its neutrality from any alliances and the opportunity to move troops on their territory in exchange for guaranteeing their absolute independence. With all terms and conditions having been mutually agreed upon, it remains only to sign the necessary agreements and make the announcement."
ice.107.a: "Grant their Independence" #
