MXF_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "Free Republican Movement\n§gA minor political movement that has picked up steam following the Restoration, the Free Republican Movement was one of the first explicitly anti-Mosley movements within the Union of Britain, formed in 1935 by former TUC members Ernest Thurtle and Arthur Greenwood with the goal of preserving the republican, parliamentarian system before the then Deputy Chairman had even taken power. Both men and their main supporters would be jailed for much of the next 15 years, but were released during the downfall of Mosley's regime. Today, they act as an obstructionist political grouping within London, campaigning for a referendum on the Monarchy and a return to a republican (though explicitly not syndicalist) system.§!"
