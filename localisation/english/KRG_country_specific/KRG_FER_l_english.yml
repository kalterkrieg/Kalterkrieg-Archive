###Ideas###

FER_newly_declared_republic: "Newly Declared Republic"
FER_newly_declared_republic_desc: "It's safe to say that without the Republic, the Far East would have collapsed under the weight of the war effort. But now, with the first steps towards true democracy taken, we can begin our efforts towards cementing our new nation. While it may be difficult to instill democracy into the peoples of the Far East, the world smiles upon us as we bring freedom and liberty to our citizens."
FER_kolchaks_legacy: "Kolchak's Legacy"
FER_kolchaks_legacy_desc: "Taking into consideration Kolchak's long career in the Navy, it's not a surprise that his tenure as Supreme Leader resulted in the prioritization of military industry over the civilian market. However, some argue that this hyperfocus on the military is what allowed us to expand beyond the Amur. In addition to this, Kolchak knew how to raise an army and make it effective. So while the Supreme Leader left a legacy of fearsome soldiers struggling against Savinkov's brutes for a better Russia, the militarization has certainly caused some problems…"
FER_russian_pretenders: "Russian Pretender"
FER_russian_pretenders_desc: "While we are the rightful rulers of Russia, the international community does not see it that way, and recognizes The Russian State over our administration. We must correct this if the world is to support us in our future drive to Moscow."

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_VICTOR_PEPELYAEV_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 8th, 1885\nNarym, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\nBefore the February Revolution of 1917, Viktor Pepelyayev served in the Russian Duma as a member of the Cadet Party. However, Pepelyayev faced controversy in 1914 for proposing that indigenous peoples in Siberia receive education in their native languages. Perhaps it was fate that the man accused of Siberian separatism was now the leader of a rival government in that very same region. But this isn't the end goal for Pepelyayev. A former member of Kolchak's government, Viktor Pepelyayev and his Union of National Salvation party was quick to seize power in Vladivostok after the Supreme Leader's death.\n\nNow Pepelyayev, President of the Far Eastern Republic, must guide his nation into the turbulent future, against all odds."
