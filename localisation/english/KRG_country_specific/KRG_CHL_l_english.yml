### Ideas ###
 CHL_concessions_to_buenos_aires: "The Spirit of 39'"
 CHL_concessions_to_buenos_aires_desc: "A decade has passed since the war and the definitive end of the revolution in Chile. Some lament being tantalizingly close yet far from realizing their vision of a crimson Pacific and Andes. However, spurred on by the Ibañazo and bolstered by new recruits from the country, their leaders now coordinate with increased unity, planning for a potential democratic or armed resurgence. For now, there is no cause for concern, unless an unforeseen obstacle befalls the Liga..."
 CHL_salvador_allende: "Whispers of Rebellion"
 CHL_salvador_allende_desc: "After the war, 41 Vicuña Mackenna Avenue has become the nucleus of political intrigue in Santiago, thanks to the presence of the Argentinean embassy. In the hidden depths, secret messages pass among the castrenses, while whispers of unrest permeate the occupying army. Loyalties falter, alliances crumble, as the occupiers find themselves entangled in uncertainty. Each passing day, as Punta Arenas and Valdivia remain occupied, Chilean partisans unleash their fury upon soldiers crossing the Andes, further fueling the government's growing discontent. The Platinean Yoke, once hailed as a beacon of hope, now hangs precariously, amplifying the simmering unrest."
 CHL_economic_dumpsterfire: "Mediocre Development"
 CHL_economic_dumpsterfire_desc: "Although some cities, such as Santiago, Antofagasta, and Valparaíso, experienced bombings, the majority of our infrastructure remains relatively functional, albeit outdated. With the economic boom in the Plate region, many individuals found employment across the border and returned with capital to aid in the country's reconstruction. While foreign investment, particularly in the mining sector, has made its way in, concerted efforts by corporatist and developmentalist ministers have contributed to a moderately healthy economic output, albeit with room for improvement."

 ## Leader desc ##
 POLITICS_BARTOLOME_BLANCHE_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 6th, 1879\nLa Serena, Chile\n§W--------------§!\nBorn into a rich family he was sent to Germany where he perfected his training on the military, being classmates with Marmaduke Grove and Carlos Ibañez del Campo, his generation of military officers would be one of the most influential players on Chilean history. \"The 20's Trio\" as it was coined by El Mercurio reporter, Hernán Pérez went different ways after the 1934 Revolution. Blanche was made Lieutenant General, being a closet Anti Syndicalist no one suspected about him, when the Platine War started he was contacted by the Argentinians and was offered support for a Coup against Chairman Grove, on May 16th, 1938 a Argentinian Planes started bombing La Moneda and his divisions stormed La Moneda and declared the abolition of The Syndicalist Republic of Chile and formed a Provisional Government, Blanche planned on resigning after his job was done, but Argentina alongside the Germans pushed Blanche to stay in power until the Syndicalist menace is eradicated, personally he thinks he's too old for all of this, but he assumed \"extraordinary\" powers for the protection of the government against revolutionary activities.\n\nHis government has been plagued by economic chaos and strikes, he has been trying to manage the Radical faction of the Junta, led by General F. Javier Díaz Valderrama, and at his age he has been planning to resign as fast the Argentinians don't need him anymore. no one knows when the General will step away but the rest of the Junta is watching anxiously.\n\nAfter the death of Carlés and the Provisional Council was established on Buenos Aires he has been considering to declare independence from the Argentinian Influence Sphere, but knowing that a declaration like that would end up on a German or Argentinian intervention he needs something to distract the Argentinians...\n\nBlanche's close advisors are concerned with the instability the country has been experiencing. Blanche has delegated the responsibility of pacifying the country to probably the worst guy for the Job; \"the Radical Terror in the Night\", Carlos Vergara Montero. whatever happens next, everyone knows that Blanche will leave a mark on Chilean History."
 POLITICS_ARTURO_MERINO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 17th, 1888\nChillán, Chile\n§W--------------§!\n Benitez certainly has been an \"unusual\" part of the chilean army. While many of his brothers in arms supported the right, he supported the left; while most of the army received Blanche's coup with an applause, he received it with scepticism, and when Blanche didn't leave power, he was pissed.\n\nEventually he started to work with the democratic and leftist opposition groups to Blanche's government, hoping to find a way to get rid of Blanche's government with them. While working with the several groups, Benitez met \"Salvador Allende\", a doctor who used to work in the former socialist government. Allende and Benitez quickly became good friends and allies working together on many occasions.\n\nAs each year passed, it looked as if Benitez would never get his chance of overthrowing Blanche's government and creating a free and equal Chile, but history sometimes works in unexpected ways. Now after a small crisis spiraled out of control, Blanche's government is more unpopular than ever before. Seeing this window of opportunity, Benitez formed a United Front with Allende. The front has many factions that don't always get along with each other, but all of the factions agree on something: Blanche must go, now with Arturo finally getting an opportunity to free Chile, \"will he be successful or will his rebellion be just a footnote in Chilean history?\""
