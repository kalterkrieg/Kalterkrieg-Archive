### Ideas ###
NEE_the_open_hand_of_liberty: "The Open Hand of Liberty"
NEE_the_open_hand_of_liberty_desc: "Since taking back New York city, we've regained the entrance to America for those coming across the Atlantic. There are crowds of people uprooting their lives to move and migrating to new lands which they believe will allow them to flourish."
NEE_politically_radical_states: "Politically Radical States"
NEE_politically_radical_states_1: "Politically Radical States"
NEE_politically_radical_states_2: "Politically Radical States"
NEE_politically_radical_states_desc: "Our gains from the CSA have been small in land, but large in population. Now Upstate New York is reunited with it's downstate addition of New York City. The finest city in the land, the home of American's finances, Populated, wealthy, glorious. Of course that's what it once was.\n\nNow after a decade of syndicalist control, New York City has become a dump from the syndicalist plundering of New York's wealth, either for money to put into the war effort or for ideological purposes. It'll take ages to restore the city to its previous state.\n\nMeanwhile, a few miles away sits the state of New Jersey. Jersey is an oddity within the New English republic, considering it was very recently controlled by the AUS. When we took New York city, the unravelling CSA had recently pacified the state. Knowing a good opportunity when we see it, we moved in and occupied the state, as the syndicalists retreated further into their interior.\n\nNow Jersey sits as the political black sheep of the family. It's loyalties lay with the Long regime rather with the Canadian backed New English republic. They're sure to cause a nasty headache in our political realm. Let's just hope the AUS doesn't get any funny ideas from their disloyalty to the New English state."
NEE_canadian_partnership: "The Canadian Partnership"
NEE_canadian_partnership_desc: "It is no secret that Canada has played a massive role in the recent prosperity in New England. From the export of weapons and ships during the 2nd Weltkrieg to the political support granted to our government by the King Government, Canada is a main reason we exist.\n\nHowever, this relationship is mutually beneficial. While we have gained legitimacy from the Canadians and profited massively from wartime exports, we in many ways funded the reconquest of the British Isles through lend lease. Now, as our economy grows even larger from the liberation of Philadelphia and the surrounding areas, we are poised to expand our role in the Accord, truly embracing our destiny as a great power."
NEE_economic_boom: "Economic Boom"
NEE_economic_boom_1: "Economic Boom"
NEE_economic_boom_desc: "Ever since our northern neighbors intervened in the devastating war on the North American continent, they have brought nothing but peace and prosperity for the men and women of New England. Our Canadian brethren, along with the rest of her mighty allies, have spared no expense into investing in our rapidly expanding economy, and thanks to the newly acquired financial markets of Wall Street, we have entered into a new dawn, a nation reborn, one closer to the Maple Leaf than to the Bald Eagle. While America remains scarred by conflict and eternal warfare, we are here enjoying the comfort and the protection provided by Canada."
NEE_fortress_ne: "Fortress New England"
NEE_fortress_ne_desc: "In the first months of the 2nd American Civil War New Englanders mobilized to defend their new republic. The new government quickly ordered the construction of a defensive line on the New York-Pennsylvania border to protect New England from the Syndicalists. Known as the Maple Line, this series of fortifications from the Canadian border to the Atlantic Ocean has protected New Englanders for a decade now.\n\nHowever, while these defenses have deterred attacks from the Combined Syndicates and now the American Union State, it has also in effect meant that our troops have seen very little combat in spite of the global war that has just taken place. Our offensive doctrine is woefully behind and mostly just copied off of our Canadian friends. In order to step out from underneath the shadow of Canada, New England will have to make massive military reforms."
NEE_reimbursing_victims: "Reimbursing Victims of Pillaging"
NEE_canadian_shipyards: "Shipyards of the Royal Navy"
NEE_canadian_shipyards_desc: "Once secured by the Canadians in 1937, New England immediately became a powerhouse for Canadian naval production in the leadup to the reclamation of the Home Isles. Fore River Shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts, was contracted by the Royal Navy almost immediately after the liberation of New England, and after the New Englander army secured New York City and Philadelphia, the Brooklyn Naval Yard and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard both began pumping out capital ships at a tremendous clip. By 1948, New England has produced half a dozen aircraft carriers and large numbers of other surface vessels for the Royal Navy. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, as Canada is able to project its naval power far beyond what it would be able to alone, and we are compensated handsomely for doing so."

NEE_legacy_of_abolitionism: "Legacy of Abolitionism"
NEE_legacy_of_abolitionism_desc: "“I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch…”\n\nThose were the words of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, printed in the first issue of The Liberator over a century ago. Garrison was from Newburyport, in Massachusetts, and The Liberator was published in Boston; he was only one link in a long, winding chain— ever since the days of Bunker Hill and Sam Adams, New England has been home to America’s radicals, abolitionists, and activists of all stripes.\n\nThis, as expected, has not changed with the coming of the twentieth century, and the passing of yet another Civil War. It is truer than ever, in fact, in a time where civil rights, discrimination, and equality have been pushed to the forefront and laid bare to the average American through years of struggle and an experiment in popular revolution. From Augusta to Philadelphia and everywhere in between, those who have long been denied their rights —women, colored folk, immigrants, Catholics and Jews— are beginning a new chapter in New England’s history of social progress."

nee.0.t: "The Commonwealth of New England"
nee.0.d: "The Commonwealth of New England is a new nation, born in the fires of the collapse of the United States of America, however its first years have been more prosperous than anyone could have hoped. As the rest of America was plunged into civil war, the Canadians saved New England from invasion by offering protection and autonomy. Most if not all New Englanders were happy and relieved to be under the protection of the Canadians, and New England's president David I. Walsh moved the New Englander economy closer to Canada's than ever before.\n\nNew England was rewarded for its loyalty with expansion into New York City, New Jersey, and the eastern part of Pennsylvania. However these areas are in a bleak state and it's hard to imagine that they were once the same nation as the rest of New England. They have been ravaged by war and have become increasingly radicalized. It will take a tremendous effort for New England to integrate them. \n\nLooming over all of this is New England's relationship with Canada. While Canada was once New England's protector, New England has grown to be a world power in its own right, with a booming economy and a population nearly double Canada's. As its relationship with the American Union State sours, New England has drawn closer to the Pacific States, and many in Canada worry that New England is too focused on American unification rather than defense of liberalism in Europe. These questions and the question of unification with our ideological counterpart on the west coast the PSA will determine the near future for New England."
nee.0.a: "God Save New England"

nee.1.t: "The Situation in the Occupied States"
nee.1.d: "When Canada decided to intervene in the 2nd American Civil War, many New Englanders were comfortable staying behind the Maple Line in peace and prosperity. But when Canada offered the bounties of New York City, Eastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey it just could not be passed up. While devastated, those states added a tremendous boost in economic and manpower. They also added legitimacy to New England's claim as the real United States government. Under orders from President David I. Walsh, with congressional consent, the New England Army marched in and set up an occupation authority.\n\nNew York City was granted statehood in 1946, just after its absence from the 1945 elections cost Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. the presidency. (Though some argue Kennedy's bribery scandal was the ultimate culprit.) After President Raymond E. Baldwin was sworn in on Beacon Hill, Speaker of the House John McCormack and Senator Majority Leader Irving Ives agreed to form the Joint Congressional Committee on Mid-Atlantic Statehood (JCCMAS). JCCMAS would oversee the occupational authority, including its commanding officer, General Willard Wyman.\n\nAs the occupation winds down, Wyman has been called in for more and more hearings in front of the committee in Boston. His latest reports are middling in outlook. The conditions in the occupation zone are improving slowly, but consistently. While Senator Ives and Senate Republicans preach caution, Speaker McCormack has all but assured the press and New England voters that a vote on statehood will happen before September of 1949, just in time for the '49 elections. Many assume that New Jersey and Pennsylvania will strongly vote Democratic, and Democrats are eager to have those electoral votes on their side.\n\nHowever, before the votes on statehood can be cast, the occupation authority must finish its work. Eliminating the remaining socialist organizers and agitators will be the first order of business, followed by the establishment of a civilian police force and local governments in the cities and towns under occupation. Speaker McCormack has ordered the occupation to finish up by September of 1949, however President Baldwin is dragging his feet a bit, hoping that it might take just a bit too long and give him a much better shot at re-election. Whatever the outcome, we cannot proceed in our ambitions to lead the new liberal alliance or face down the Kaiser without solving this ulcer to our south."
nee.1.a: "Good luck General Wyman"
nee.2.t: "New Jersey and Pennsylvania Reapply for Statehood"
nee.2.d: "New Jersey and Pennsylvania statehood were both officially taken up by the New England Congress today. The House will take it up first, with it expected to pass nearly unanimously. Only a few very partisan Republicans oppose it as the Progressive and Democratic nature of the new states are likely to hurt Republicans.\n\nIn fact, the two new states are very likely to cause President Baldwin to lose reelection. He has acknowledged this, but has reiterated that reuniting the United States is more important than his reelection."
nee.2.d_failed: "New Jersey and Pennsylvania statehood were both officially taken up by the New England Congress today. While General Wyman said that the states were not ready, Speaker of the House John McCormack accused the General of political stalling and argued that the President had pushed him to prevent the states from being admitted prior to the '49 elections. General Wyman denied this charge in front of JCCMAS, but Speaker McCormack is going forward with the statehood bill anyway.\n\nThe House will take it up first, with it expected to pass nearly unanimously. Only a few very partisan Republicans oppose it as the Progressive and Democratic nature of the new states are likely to hurt Republicans.\n\nIn fact, the two new states are very likely to cause President Baldwin to lose reelection. He has acknowledged this, but has reiterated that reuniting the United States is more important than his reelection."
nee.2.a: "Welcome back to the Union!"

nee.3.t: "The New England Political System"
nee.3.d: "As the 2nd American Civil War wrapped up, representatives from the Pacific States and New England met in Ottawa to sign the Ottawa Protocols. The Protocols dictate that each nation recognized the other as a legitimate successor of the United States, and that should the Americas be reunited, the two nations would join together. Per the Ottawa Accords, both nations had to follow the United States constitution as written.\n\nHence, New England has a senate and a house of representatives just like the United States. When you click on a core state, you can see the party popularity of that state, the number of electoral votes, the governor, the general electoral lean of the state, and the makeup of the house and senate delegations. When the elections happen, the house delegations will reflect the state party popularity of each party, if a senate seat or governorship is up, the most popular party will win the seat. The same goes for the electoral college, the largest party in that state on election day will win that state's electoral votes."
nee.3.a: "Understood"

nee.11.t: "Progressives Protest the New Ban"
nee.11.d: "Hundreds of protestors have taken to the streets in light of the recent ban on the Socialist Party of America. While the strongest protests were seen in the New States, there were sizable rallies in Massachusetts and Vermont. The progressive party is claiming that the SPA has the right to run in New England elections on the basis of the first amendment. However, our government has argued that the SPA has lost all of its rights after its role in the Second American Civil War. Either way, the progressive party does not have enough power to change our decision and the protests will most likely end in a few weeks."
nee.11.a: "This is necessary for our security"

nee.12.t: "President Baldwin Speaks at the Reopening of Independence Hall"
nee.12.d: "Today President Raymond Baldwin has traveled from Boston to Philadelphia for the reopening of the once-famous independence hall. The hall is most known for the location where both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were signed. During the Second American Civil War However, the hall was nearly destroyed during Syndicalist shelling in the Battle of Philadelphia. Luckily, due to our government's reconstruction efforts, the hall has been completely restored to its pre-war glory. President Baldwin began his speech by thanking the construction workers and speaking about the Founding Fathers' wishes and dreams of American Democracy.\n\nUnexpectedly, Baldwin concluded his speech with an attack on the American Union State calling its leaders "traitors who stand against everything the Founding Fathers fought for". Regardless, after Baldwin's speech, a grand celebration took place later that night with hundreds of fireworks to light up the sky."
nee.12.a: "The spirit of the America will endure forevermore"

nee.13.t: "Election Season in New England Begins!"
nee.13.d: "As party conventions wrap up, the general election campaign is now in full swing!\n\nThe Republicans have renominated President Raymond E. Baldwin. He wields a classical liberal coalition, pledging to maintain a close relationship with Canada, enhance the power of big business, and be a powerful force in NATO.\n\nThe Democrats have nominated former Governor of Upstate New York W. Averell Harriman with his running mate Herbert Lehman. Harriman represents a changing Democratic party, he sees the parties' roots as representative of the working man as a need for the party to change. He has maintained some socially conservative themes, tougher on immigration and more protectionist, but he has embraced some aspects of welfare and aims to increase government spending. Because of these campaign promises, many Progressives have pledged to support him."
nee.13.a: "Four More Years!"
nee.13.b: "Harriman's the Man!"

nee.14.t: "The 1949 Elections!"
nee.14.d: "Election day is here and the Democrats and Republicans have made their final pitch to the voters. Across the Commonwealth, voters are now going to the polls to decide whether Raymond E. Baldwin will be reelected or whether W. Averell Harriman will replace him."
nee.14.a: "Lets see who the winner is..."

nee.15.t: "Raymond E. Baldwin Reelected!"
nee.15.d: "After multiple news networks called Upstate New York for President Baldwin, the Republican candidate declared victory at his campaign headquarters in Hartford last night. Surrounded by his wife Edith and their 3 children, the former Governor of Connecticut held a triumphant speech outlining his agenda for his second term. Preaching for tax cuts, a balanced budget, and further cooperation with Canada, Baldwin painted an optimistic picture for New England as it enters its 3rd decade of existence.\n\nFormer ambassador to Canada W. Averell Harriman held his concession speech in Albany. He congratulated President Baldwin on his re-election and pledged to work with him to continue New England's prosperity.\n\nWith the votes tallied, the electoral college results are:\n\nBaldwin: [?marlib_electoral_votes] Electoral Votes\nHarriman: [?soccon_electoral_votes] Electoral Votes"
nee.15.a: "Hail to the Chief!"

nee.16.t: "W. Averell Harriman elected President!"
nee.16.d: "After multiple news networks called New Jersey for Ambassador Harriman, the Democratic candidate declared victory at his campaign headquarters in Albany last night. Surrounded by his wife Marie and their 2 children, the former Ambassador to Canada held a triumphant speech outlining his agenda for his second term. Preaching for expanded healthcare and education programs, and increased consumer protections, President-Elect Harriman painted an optimistic picture for New England as it enters its 3rd decade of existence.\n\nPresident Baldwin held his concession speech in Hartford. He congratulated President-Elect Harriamn on his victory and pledged to work with him to continue New England's prosperity.\n\nWith the votes tallied, the electoral college results are:\n\nHarriman: [?soccon_electoral_votes] Electoral Votes\nBaldwin: [?marlib_electoral_votes] Electoral Votes"
nee.16.a: "Hail to the Chief!"

nee.17.t: "The NATO Agreement comes up for Senate Ratification"
nee.17.d: "Per the constitution, the Senate has the authority to advise and consent on all foreign treaties. After Secretary of State John Foster Dulles returned from the Vancouver Summit, having signed the NATO agreement, President Baldwin immediately began lobbying senators to support the treaty. Most Republicans are on board, citing the increased freedom of movement between NATO members and the pledge to lower tariffs.\n\nSome Democrats have voiced opposition, afraid that the treaty will cede authority to Canada. Scarred from the occupation of 1937 and the Canadian takeover of the New England military industrial complex in the 1940s, many conservative Democrats are Canada-skeptics, afraid that Canada will begin to re-assert authority over New England.\n\nPresident Baldwin has assured Democrats that this will not happen, and the Executive Council of Economic Advisors put out a statement saying that with the addition of the mid-Atlantic States, New England's economy will far out-grow Canada's over the next decade. Baldwin has used this statement as a way to draw some Democrats over to those in favor by arguing that this will actually enable New England to assert authority over Canada, though the administration has denied this motivation publicly.\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democratic Party, those from New York City and Massachusetts, have expressed support, believing that democracies need to band together against the Longists in the south. Despite these conflicts, the treaty will likely skate to an easy ratification on the back of the Republican senate majority."
nee.17.a: "Let them advise and consent"

nee.18.t: "Senate Ratifies the NATO Agreement"
nee.18.d: "With an overwhelming majority, the NATO Agreement has passed the senate, and will now come into effect once the other member nations ratify. The Republican senate majority was joined by a large contingent of Democrats which ensured passage. Senate Majority Leader Irving Ives appeared with President Baldwin on Beacon Hill and held a triumphant press conference. Minority Leader Philip Philbin voted for the measure, but did not make a statement, his party was split on the vote.\n\nNATO is an unprecedented step in American history, never before has an American nation been as close to another as New England will be with Canada and the other members once it comes into effect. This is truly a historic moment."
nee.18.a: "As it should be"

nee.19.t: "Congress Grants Mid-Atlantic Statehood!"
nee.19.d: "Eight years after their occupation by the Army of New England, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have officially been incorporated into the Commonwealth of New England as states. Their statehood came after a report was presented to the Joint Congressional Committee on Mid-Atlantic Statehood (JCCMAS) which detailed the process of de-syndicalization and reconstruction of the region. While the report was not exactly conclusive about how many socialist sympathizers remain in the territories, JCCMAS has generally expressed frustration and impatience at how long the occupation has lasted.\n\nIt was no secret that President Baldwin was hoping to delay Mid-Atlantic statehood until after the 1949 election, but Democrats in Congress threatened to torpedo the rest of Baldwin's agenda if he and the Republican majority in the senate did not take up the issue. JCCMAS has met routinely and held hearings since 1945 when the related committee on New York City was dissolved. Speaker of the House John McCormack made it clear that he would not wait until 1950 to take up the issue of Mid-Atlantic statehood, and almost as soon as General Willard Wyman, the commander in charge of the occupation, finished testifying and submitting his report to JCCMAS, McCormack immediately took up the bill in the House of Representatives granting statehood to the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Irving Ives did not have much of a choice but to follow suit, given General Wyman's testimony that the occupation was costing New England taxpayers an arm and a leg, and was no longer necessary. The bill heads to President Baldwin's desk where he is sure to sign it. While Republicans have put on a brave face and made vague statements about the "triumph of democracy in former syndicalist regions," it is the Democrats who are ecstatic, as the two new states are expected to be dominated by the Democratic Party."
nee.19.a: "The Union Grows"

nee.20.t: "The Vice President Breaks a tie in the Senate"
nee.20.d: "The current bill has passed the House of Representatives, but has resulted in a tie in the Senate. The Vice President has done one of his two constitutional duties and cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the bill, sending it to President [NEE.GetLeader]'s desk for his signature."
nee.20.a: "Well done Mr. Vice President"

nee.21.t: "The Civil Rights Question"
nee.21.d: "“I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch…”\n\nThose were the words of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, printed in the first issue of The Liberator over a century ago. Garrison was from Newburyport, in Massachusetts, and The Liberator was published in Boston; he was only one link in a long, winding chain— ever since the days of Bunker Hill and Sam Adams, New England has been home to America’s radicals, abolitionists, and activists of all stripes.\n\nThis, as expected, has not changed with the coming of the twentieth century, and the passing of yet another Civil War. It is truer than ever, in fact, in a time where civil rights, discrimination, and equality have been pushed to the forefront and laid bare to the average American through years of struggle and an experiment in popular revolution. From Augusta to Philadelphia and everywhere in between, those who have long been denied their rights —women, colored folk, immigrants, Catholics and Jews— are beginning a new chapter in New England’s history of social progress."
nee.21.a: "This wont be easy"

nee.22.t: "The Consumer Protection Act Passes Congress"
nee.22.d: "The Senate has passed the Consumer Protection Act, officially sending it to President [NEE.GetLeader]'s desk. Acting as President of the Senate, the President pro tempore and senator from New Hampshire Styles Bridges announced the bill's passage this afternoon.\n\nAfter easy passage in the Democratic controlled House of Representatives, the bill faced very tough odds in the Senate. After President [NEE.GetLeader] announced that he wanted the bill as part of the agenda for this legislative session, Speaker John McCormack rushed fast passage in the house in the hopes that it would put pressure on the more Republican favored Senate.\n\nAfter trying to work with the administration on the bill, the Republican leader and senator from Upstate New York Irving Ives announced his opposition. However, President [NEE.GetLeader]'s political operation held strong as they were able to whip enough Republicans into voting for the bill with only minor concessions.\n\nPresident [NEE.GetLeader] will hold a bill signing ceremony within a few days officially enacting the Consumer Protection Act of [GetYear] into law."
nee.22.a: "Well done gentlemen!"

nee.23.t: "The GI Bill Passes Congress"
nee.23.d: "The Senate has officially passed a renewal of the GI Bill. Offically known as the Serviceman's Readjustmant Act of [GetYear], the original bill was passed in 1942 but was set to expire in 1952. With war looming on the horizon and a knew generation of New Englander men set to be drafted President [NEE.GetLeader] and leaders of congress universally agreed that a renewal was the best course of action.\n\nWith support completely across the board, the question was not whether the bill would pass, but what would be in the bill when it did pass. While Progressives tried to fit further welfare provisions for veterans and their descendants, the bill was primarily written by Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the house."
nee.23.a: "Sign it into Law"

nee.24.t: "The Morganthau Plan"
nee.24.d: "Now that President Harriman has returned the Democrats to Beacon Hill, he has appointed Henry Morgenthau Jr. to his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. While his predecessor did not have a chance to overhaul New England’s economy, Baldwin’s budget and tax cuts have left the Harriman Administration tightening its belt in the face of all it wants to accomplish. As a veteran of New England’s Federal Farm Board and advisor to the Walsh Administration, Secretary Morgenthau was an easy pick for Harriman’s cabinet. His agenda, referred to as ‘The Morgenthau Plan’, will focus on aggressive fiscal efficiency to get the most out of expanded government programs without incurring a deficit while utilizing his position to combat corruption in New England.\n\nSecretary Morgenthau’s strategy will involve expanding government programs that target New England’s poorest citizens. As a conservative Democrat, Morgenthau’s push only calls for a moderate increase in budgeting for welfare programs and instead focuses on increased funding for primary and secondary education. He plans to balance New England’s budget so that the government can properly care for its citizens while paying off its debts instead of growing them. He hopes to cooperate with businesses by encouraging investing in foreign countries across The Accord so that New England can secure the resources it needs to prosper. Furthermore, Morgenthau’s plan involves utilizing the Treasury to examine tax records of suspected criminals. This collaboration between the Treasury and law enforcement will allow the government to arrest high-ranking criminals on financial charges which cannot be shifted to a fall-guy. An abridged memo of the Morgenthau Plan meant for Harriman’s advisors leaked to the press.\n\nOutline of The Fiscal Policy of Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau for 1950-1958: Balance the national budget by increasing taxation of the highest brackets and eliminating redundant spending. Then utilize the new budget efficiently by targeting highest need areas of funding. Cement New England’s position as a source of international trade by encouraging investments across the Accord. Empower the Treasury to utilize law enforcement to target corruption and crime elements. Finally, reduce inflation and utilize the nation’s gold reserves to stabilize the value of the dollar.\n\nWhile President Harriman’s goals might stretch the boundaries of Morgenthau’s balanced budget, The Morgenthau Plan has garnered bipartisan support for its moderate, business-savvy spending habits. With the growing importance of the Accord in New England’s foreign policy, it is now up to Congress to decide whether or not these policies will be signed into law."
nee.24.a: "The Dollar will be As Good As Gold!"

nee.25.t: "The Weeks Plan"
nee.25.d: "President Baldwin’s first term was often considered by many to be a caretaker term highlighted by its stability and only minor budget cuts from his predecessor. This is changing, however, as the Baldwin Administration is now free to let loose with a second term in office. This radical transition towards classical liberalism was a driving force behind Baldwin’s reelection campaign and represents the cumulative work of Treasury Secretary Sinclair Weeks. Known colloquially as ‘Baldwin’s Tax Cuts’ by the average voter, The Weeks Plan is a top-to-bottom overhaul of New England’s economy focused on sensible spending and infrastructure investment.\n\nSecretary Weeks was appointed to Baldwin’s cabinet in 1946 and came with an impressive resume of business acumen and economic credentials. As a Harvard graduate, President of the New England Enterprise Association, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Senator, and treasurer of the Republican National Committee, Weeks was the obvious man for the job. With a firmly pro-business stance, his economic strategy aims to supercharge New England’s economic recovery by empowering businesses and reducing spending. While the document is dozens of pages, most of Baldwin’s cabinet has received an abridged memo outlining the major pillars of the Weeks Plan.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Weeks’ Economic Recovery Outline for 1950-1954: Eliminate superfluous Walsh-era wartime measures to enable a reduction in the tax burden on middle-class families. Further reallocate existing budget towards infrastructure investments including but not limited to highway expansion, then promote the use of private sector services over government-run programs. Enable growth in the business sector by increasing tax credits available to financial and industrial institutions and facilitate American investment in foreign countries in lieu of aid packages.\n\nWhile the Weeks Plan is much more nuanced than a short memo, it paints a clear picture of President Baldwin’s vision for New England. A smaller, pro-business government will certainly be controversial in the Democrat dominant New England, but it has the potential to grow the nation’s GDP rapidly. Growing the nation is more important than ever with the looming Longist threat, and it is now up to Congress to decide if signing the Weeks Plan into law is the best way to enable that."

nee.26.d1: "As the term for President [NEE.GetLeader] reaches its halfway point, the people of New England are about to render their judgment on how he and the Republican Party have performed while in power the last two years. Republican tax cuts have put far more money into the pockets of middle and upper class New Englanders, but have also strained the federal budget and have done little to assist the lower classes, especially those in the new states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. There can be no doubt that Democrats will attack the Republican agenda on those lines, and as has happened historically, Democrats are likely to gain strongly in November."
nee.26.d2: "As the term for President [NEE.GetLeader] reaches its halfway point, the people of New England are about to render their judgment on how he and the Democratic Party have performed while in power the last two years.

nee.28.t: "The 1953 Election Season begins!"
nee.28.d1: "The 1953 general election season has begun! The Republican Party has nominated Governor of Upstate New York Thomas Dewey. After eight years of the conservative policies of Raymond Baldwin, the Republicans have recognized that New Englanders may now be looking for a more liberal president. Dewey has been the de-facto leader of the liberal wing of the GOP during the Baldwin presidency and has nominated his friend and fellow liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller as his running mate.\n\nThe Democrats have nominated Senator Herbert Lehman. Lehman is the definition of a statesmen. A longtime senator and player in New York politics, he is the scion of the Lehman family, founders of the Lehman Brothers investment bank. An older choice, many New Englanders may be put off by his age, but Democrats view Lehamn's experience and connections as an asset against the young newcomer Dewey, especially as a former vice-presidential candidate. Lehman would also be the first Jewish president of New England and has named Maurice Tobin of Massachusetts as his running mate.."
nee.28.d2: "The 1953 general election season has begun! The Republican Party has nominated Governor of Upstate New York Thomas Dewey. Looking to reclaim Beacon Hill after four years of Averell Harriman, the Republicans have hoped to grab more of the political center by nominating a liberal Republican. Dewey's nomination was pretty much a foregone conclusion after Baldwin's defeat in 1949, as he is and was the most powerful Republican governor in New England. Dewey has been the de-facto leader of the liberal wing of the GOP and has nominated his friend and fellow liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller as his running mate.\n\nThe Democrats re-nominated President W. Averell Harriman for president and Herbert Lehman as Vice President. After a successful four years, they hope he can reclaim the legacy of President David Walsh and entrench the Democrats as the natural governing party in New England through continued expansions of the welfare state and growth of New England's booming economy."

nee.32.d: "Soon after the passage of Mid-Atlantic Statehood by Congress, Speaker of the House John McCormack announced that the Joint Congressional Committee on Mid-Atlantic Statehood (JCCMAS) would not be immediately dissolved. Considering how poor the economic situation is in the new states, as testified to by former commander of the occupation, General Willard Wyman, Speaker McCormack and Senate Majority Leader Irving Ives struck a deal to form a new commission to investigate how poor the economic situation truly is in the region.\n\nThey announced that under the jurisdiction of the JCCMAS, the Delaware Commission will be formed to fact find and write a report on the state of the economy in the new states. Named for the major river flowing through the region, the commission will be headed by John Kenneth Galbraith. A Canadian-American economist currently a professor at Harvard, Galbraith has traveled across the devastated steel belt, including to the Union State, and has studied post-war economics extensively. With the confidence of both Democrats and Republicans, Galbraith is expected to fact-find and write his report over the coming months, and then return to JCCMAS with his reccomendations."

nee.33.d: "After being dispatched by congress in the aftermath of New Jersey and Pennsylvania statehood, the Delaware Commission was a fact-finding mission led by bureaucrats and academics to assess the economic situation of the new states. The Commission presented its report to Congress, the Departments of Commerce and Interior, and of course the office of the President. The Joint Congressional Committee on Mid-Atlantic Statehood was gaveled back into session to question the chairman of the commission, John Kenneth Galbraith.\n\nThe results are not good. The economic situation of the new states is quite poor. The infrastructure is in a bad state, business have either left, or suffer from a lack of goods. Even if certain businesses do have goods, they are price-gauging their customers because there is not enough competition.\n\nThe Commission recommends massive investment in the region to revitalize the area. However, even if these projects are undertaken, it is clear that the economic boom that we have experienced the last few years is at an end."

Despite being on the other side of the Atlantic, the Spanish Republic and New England share a common history in the last 20 years. During the 1930s Spain found itself embroiled in a long and brutal civil war between Royalists, Republicans, and Syndicalists. After years of fighting, the Republicans and Syndicalists came together to defeat the Royalists and create the Spanish Republic. Over 10 years after the end of the war and the Spanish Republic has been isolated in Europe due to its Syndicalist aligned government.\n\nYet this changed when President [NEE.GetLeader] reached out to the Spanish Republic to attempt to integrate it into the Accord.

The broadcast itself has been hailed by industry experts as the most significant advancement in television broadcasting since the technology's inception.

This statement was, in turn, refuted by CBS's vice president of broadcasting who said that color TV adoption would only increase as newer cheaper methods of production were inevitably discovered. For their part, many color TV owners said that the broadcast was almost as good as being in the stands of Yankee Stadium. Unfortunately for the Brooklyn Dodgers, color broadcasting did not help in their battle against the New York Yankees who went on to win their fifth World Series title after baseman Billy Martin hit a game-winning RBI single."

The contents of the new museum are equally impressive. The large collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and contemporary art has likewise received praise from art enthusiasts throughout the country. Museum director James Johnson Sweeney hopes to use the positive reception that the Guggenheim has received to convince more artists to donate their work to its ever-growing collection. Mr. Sweeney has also announced plans to acquire a large number of pieces that were made during the 1930's avant-garde movement that was championed by the Commune of France. This controversial announcement has been heavily criticized by certain members of Congress who claim that prominently displaying such art could be dangerous. Another point of controversy is the legal status of some of the pieces that Mr. Sweeney hopes to obtain; the vast majority having been seized by the German government after the fall of Paris in 1945. Mr. Sweeney has responded to these controversies by stating that syndicalist art should be preserved so that future generations may understand the sinister nature of state sponsored propaganda."

The Jersey City and New York City Fire Departments spent the entire morning evacuating drivers and attempting to put out the chemical fire. After 5 hours of battling the toxic fire, the New Jersey Fire Department put out the fire at approximately 1:00 in the afternoon. The fire injured over 66 drivers, almost entirely due to smoke inhalation, and would kill one firefighter and a laborer from Philadelphia.

This theory quickly fell apart after he wrote his first letter to the police and he denounced all factions throughout the Civil War. Curiously, during New England's involvement in the Second Weltkrieg, the Mad Bomber sent a letter to the police promising not to create bombs until the end of the war.

Thompson hit a long home run into the left field stands, which walked the game off for the Giants 5-4, and clinched them the NL pennant.\n\nThe moment was immortalized by Giants radio broadcaster Russ Hodges: "There's a long drive...it's gonna be, I believe...The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! Bobby Thomson hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands!

After his service, he then began work in New York City as a Mechanic until being injured in a company accident in 1931. Metesky was refused workers' compensation by his employers and developed a hatred towards those in the city.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1957, Metesky planted over 33 bombs injuring 15 people. However, by tracing his notes, which were always left at the bomb sites, police were able to use a handwriting sample to track Metesky's apartment. There, they found multiple unarmed bombs and electrical parts that confirmed their suspicion. Detectives arrested Metesky and brought him into the station for further questioning. George Metesky's trial is set to begin soon and with over 47 counts of destructive acts against him, many observers expect the former marine to plead insanity."

Described as a "cultural visit", the young Hapsburg monarch brings with him a large collection of precious Medieval era artwork that has been in his family's possession for generations.The artwork will be the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition on the Late Middle Ages. The month-long exhibition, which opens a week from today, is being called "the event of the year" by observers. Every celebrity, businessman, and government official is expected to attend. Security has been ramped up across the city as fears of theft or destruction of any of the pieces set to be displayed are high. Worse is the thought that some former syndicalists, bitter over their defeat, may make an attempt on Otto I's life. NYPD Commissioner George P. Monaghan has stated that every possible measure is being taken to ensure that the Hapsburg event goes according to plan."
nee.71.a: "Say what you will, the Hapsburgs had taste."

nee.73.t: "Bell Labs Announces Invention of Solar Battery"
nee.73.d: "A trio of scientists working for Bell Labs have created what they call a "silicon solar battery". Made up of several solar cells, a solar battery is a device that can convert energy from the sun into electricity. While currently expensive to produce, the potential of solar batteries has already set the scientific community ablaze with excitement. The three men responsible for this invention, Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson, are expected to be honored by the president for their incredible contribution to science."

nee.74.t: "The Horror of Ellis Island Laid to Rest"
nee.74.d: "New Yorker's opened their morning papers yesterday to read of the state's plan to close Ellis Islanzd at the end of the month. Ellis Island. A name that once brought back memories of love and new beginnings. Now a name that only brings back nightmares. Nightmares of hatred and death. This is the tarnished legacy that Ellis Island now bears. A legacy brought on by an oppressive regime that once claimed to be fighting for the good of all mankind. Their hatred and fanaticism turning the island into a veritable Hell on Earth. Abandoned at the start of the civil war, Ellis Island began its dark journey to infamy when Benjamin J. Davis Jr. was selected to lead the Combined Syndicates' new Bureau of Revolutionary Protection in 1940. Davis, a former lawyer and civil rights activist, was an admirer of Oswald Mosely and planned to enact his own interpretation of totalism. His mad devotion to what he called justice would lead to Ellis Island becoming his own personal death camp. Tens-of-thousands of so-called "enemies of the people" would die under his watch, all in the name of protecting the Revolution. These facets would earn Davis the unflattering moniker of "The Red Robespierre" by his victims. The war's end would find Ellis Island liberated by Canadian marines. Davis himself would be apprehended a month later while attempting to flee to Mexico. Found guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, Benjamin J. Davis Jr. was executed by hanging on September 5, 1945. The future of Ellis Island remains in doubt. Plans for turning the island into a memorial have been proposed but the government has declined to go forward with any of them at this time. A spokesman from the governor's office stated that Ellis Island would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Perhaps with time, the nightmares of the past will fade and dreams of a brighter tomorrow will take their place.""

nee.75.t: "Independence National Historic Park"
nee.75.d: "As Americans across the divided states celebrate the 180th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphians are especially patriotic tonight as the renovation of Independence National Historic Park has just been completed. The Park is a 55-acre strip of land directly in central Philadelphia which covers multiple historic sites of the American Revolution. From the Liberty Bell to Independence Hall, this strip of land is now protected by the New England Parks Service.\n\nAlthough the Battle of Philadelphia caused irreplaceable damage to these historic sites from heavy Syndicalist resistance, under former President Baldwin, these national treasures were given priority during reconstruction. While travel between the American Union State and New England is heavily restricted, hundreds of tourists from Maryland and Eastern Pennsylvania came to pay respect to the home of the American Revolution. Tonight at the opening, it felt as if the crowd was not made of New Englanders or Longists, but of Americans."

nee.76.t: "Pacific Airlines Flight 624 Crashes"
nee.76.d: "Tragedy has struck the Pennsylvanian town of Scranton as early this afternoon Pacific Airlines Flight 624 came crashing out of the sky killing all 43 passengers and crew. Flight 624 was taking the popular route of San Diego to New York with multiple fuel stops across Canada and the Great Lakes Government. Since the Second American Civil War, air travel has become popular as traveling through the American Union State is incredibly difficult and expensive. Families that were split in the Pacific and New England governments are now forced to travel through Canada's harsh tundras or by air.\n\nUnfortunately, all commercial airplanes must fly completely around all territory held by the American Union State causing hours of delay. Most airlines choose to fly through Canada and then through the Great Lakes government to reach New England cities like New York and Boston. It seems that Pacific Airlines Flight 624 was taking such a route and through a mechanic malfunction, the plane came spiraling down in an empty field on Scranton's outskirts. Many are wondering if this tragedy could have been avoided if not for the plane's extended flight path."
nee.76.a: "Tragic"

nee.77.t: "The Introduction of UNIVAC"
nee.77.d: "The Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation has just announced from their Philadelphia headquarters the creation of the newest computer technology. The Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) is a state-of-the-art computing machine able to process data and statistics at nearly 7,200 decimals per second. While intended for demographic data processing for the New England Census, during the development of the UNIVAC, the New England Army became incredibly interested in the data processing capabilities.\n\nSpecifically General Leslie Groves has been working closely with EMCC to modernize the New England Army's logistics and mobilization. The UNIVAC is able to manage large-scale operations that would take months to prepare such as a possible invasion of the American Union State. The funding from the New England Army has certainly hastened the development of this modern machine. With its development and completion, the UNIVAC is now available for New England companies to order directly, speeding up the processing of all of New England."
nee.77.a: "Into the Future!"

nee.78.t: "Pennsylvania Passes law requiring loyalty oath for all government employees"
nee.78.d: "Today, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has passed an incredibly controversial law that requires all citizens employed by the Commonwealth to swear loyalty to New England. From police officers to teachers, all state workers must report to their local courthouse to swear upon a judge to defend the New England Constitution and not subvert the New England government in any way. Failing to do this task can allow the employee to be charged with perjury. Being a divided state, Pennsylvania has had to take much stronger strides in countering radical and extremist individuals. While some in the state wonder if the point of this legislation was to counter the fading Syndicalist resistance, or to prevent an AUS takeover, most are concerned with the breach of the freedom of speech. The legislation has received heavy criticism from progressive and Republicans across the state, however many state governments are wondering if they should follow suit."
nee.78.a: "I do solemnly swear…"

nee.79.t: "The Identification of Dutch Elm Disease"
nee.79.d: "After 20 years of an elm-killing disease, scientists in New Hampshire have made a breakthrough in the newly named Dutch Elm Disease. The first case of this disease can be traced all the way back to the Netherlands in 1920 where the disease gets its name. Dutch Elm Disease would not make an appearance in the United States until the 1930s through increased lumber trade with Europe. The disease ravaged the United States, particularly New England where Elm trees are prevalent. However, after years of research by New England scientists, the disease has been identified.\n\nThe disease is caused by a fungus that is spread to elm bark beetles and causes 80% of elm trees to die within a year. Out of the states in New England, New Hampshire was one of the heaviest hit, and thus the University of New Hampshire contributed much of the research towards the identification. Now that Dutch Elm Disease has been identified, preventative treatments can begin, however many dendrologists wonder if it is too late to save New England's elms."
nee.79.a: "Will anyone think of the elms?"

nee.80.t: "The Premiere of Lost Boundaries"
nee.80.d: "Opening at the local cinema is the award-winning movie: Lost Boundaries. The movie follows the Carter family who are African Americans that must pass as white to retain their home and careers. The family must ride out the segregation and racial discrimination from both white and black communities. Notably, the movie makes a direct stand against segregation in both the American Union and New England. The movie has been praised as being a direct counter to segregation across the former United States and is a stark contrast to the typical portrayal of black actors in cinema. While New England and Pacific State audiences are enjoying the movie, it has been banned in the American Union State for challenging racial norms. Regardless, it seems that Hollywood has competition from the New England Film Board."

nee.81.t: "The First Conference on Artificial Intelligence"
nee.81.d: "On October 8th, 1956 Dartmouth College held the world's first conference on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence as described by the attendees is an intelligence that is developed by machines and can be created by humans. To demonstrate artificial intelligence, they brought forth a computer that was able to solve any algebraic problem. Some observers believed that math equations is where artificial intelligence ends and left after the first hour. Those who stayed for the four-hour lecture however have left with quite the amount of knowledge and inspiration. Time will tell what these young students choose to create."

nee.82.t: "The Closing of the Elizabeth Copper Mine"
nee.82.d: "On February 7th, 1958, the miners at the Elizabeth Copper Mine collected their final paycheck before heading home to unemployment. The Elizabeth Copper Mine was created right next to the town of Strafford, Vermont, and has been in operation since 1809. Due to the massive mineral deposit, Vermont led the nation in copper production until the discovery of copper in Michigan in 1846. Since then, the Elizabeth Copper Mine has slowly been drying up as the Strafford community has left to work other jobs.\n\nAfter the Second American Civil War, the mining community had nearly ceased to exist as most working men served on the frontlines. Nearly a decade and a half later and the Vermont Copper Company decided to shut the mine permanently. While a deep unemployment hole has arisen in the town of Strafford, multiple mining companies from Upstate New York and Eastern Pennsylvania have approached workers offering them job opportunities. Although many are sad at the closing of the mine, many residents of Strafford look forward to seeing what the future will bring."

nee.83.t: "Last voyage of the S.S. Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain"
nee.83.d: "After nearly 50 years of service, the Champlain Transportation Company has decided to shut down the historic S.S. Ticonderoga. The S.S. Ticonderoga was one of the last steamboats in North America and operated in northern Vermont in Lake Champlain. The steamboat was constructed in 1906 and was one of the most popular tourist attractions in New England. The S.S. Ticonderoga made the Champlain Transportation Company incredibly high profits through the early 1920s and would even be used as a floating casino for its wealthier passengers.\n\nHowever, with steam-powered engines becoming obsolete and the economic devastation from the Second American Civil War, the Champlain Transportation Company has decided to close the S.S. Ticonderoga line. Although the ship has been unprofitable for nearly a decade, many members of the Champlain Transportation Company have refused to destroy the ship due to nostalgia. But it seems that the modern world has caught up with the ship.\n\nOn July 18th, 1950 at 2:00 pm, the S.S. Ticonderoga began its final voyage from St. Albans, Vermont. The crowd was attended by residents of the towns and villages of Lake Champlain and even included the Mayor of Burlington. After the ship's send-off, the S.S. Ticonderoga would complete its route and dock to await its transport to the scrap yard."

nee.84.d: "A historic moment in the fight for gender equality took place last night after the final votes for the governorship of Vermont were tallied. Consuelo N. Bailey, former Speaker of the House for the Vermont House of Representatives, has become the first woman to be elected to the office of lieutenant governor in American history. Running with Joseph B. Johnson, the prior lieutenant governor before now, Bailey has shown women across the continent that careers in executive branches of government are no longer the exclusive domain of men. Indeed her popularity as the state's speaker of the house is being reported as one of the reasons why Johnson-Bailey proved to be the winning ticket."
nee.84.a: "You show 'em, Bailey! "

nee.85.t: "The Launching of First Atomic Sub, NENS Swordfish"
nee.85.d: "On August 27th, 1957, the NENS Swordfish was launched out of Kittery, Maine. The NENS Swordfish is the world's first atomic submarine that relies on fission, rather than fusion of the atom. While the fusion of the atom produces much more energy at a safer level, fission is much easier to create on an industrial level. This has begun a debate in the Navy between quality vs quantity and it seems that quantity has won.\n\nWhile her counterpart, the NENS Nautilus, has made waves across the Atlantic, the NENS Swordfish is set to patrol New England shipping in the Caribbean. By once again proving its technological capabilities, the New England Navy is set to take yet another victory lap in the Atlantic. Losing yet another technological battle, the Reichspakt and American Union State are desperately pushing their scientists to fully harness the power of atomic energy."

nee.86.d: "History has been made in New England as Margaret Chase Smith has been elected the first female Senator in the history of the United States and New England. Although twice women have served in the Senate to due a vacancy left by their deceased husbands, Senator Smith is the first woman to run and win an election. Senator Smith has been serving in the United States House of Representatives under Maine's 2nd district. While originally Senator Smith's husband Clyde Smith represented the district, Mr. Smith suffered a fatal heart attack in 1940 and Margaret Chase Smith took his position.\n\nSince then, Margaret Chase Smith has represented Mainers in Congress as a moderate Republican. While she has supported her party's policies, she has condemned the Baldwin administration through its process of desyndicalization by calling it a modern-day witch trial. Despite this, it seems that the citizens of Maine have stuck by the Senator's calm and rational demeanor. The Glass Ceiling has been broken in the New England Senate."
nee.86.a: "Congratulations Senator Smith"

nee.87.t: "The End of Maine Presidential Salmon"
nee.87.d: "Terrible news out of Maine as fishermen there have failed to locate any healthy salmon for the president. The tradition of serving the president the first salmon caught out of the Penobscot River dates all the way back to 1912 under President Taft. This tradition carried its way through the Second American Civil War, though changing to the president of New England. Maine fishermen blame the salmon drought on newly built dams that obstruct the salmon's breeding grounds and an increase in pollution. Although efforts to save the salmon population are being made, the president was visibly upset that tonight's dinner would be bourbon chicken."
nee.87.a: "No smoked salmon?"

nee.88.t: "Publication of Charlotte's Web"
nee.88.d: "On October 12th, 1952, Harper and Brothers published the hit children's novel Charlotte's Web. Written by E. B. White, the book follows a pig named Wilbur who is saved by a young girl named Fern. However, Wilbur is sold to her Uncle who intends to slaughter Wilbur. A barn spider named Charlotte takes it upon herself to write messages on her web to prevent Wilbur from being killed. The book has already been praised for its whimsical, yet mature themes such as death. Charlotte's Web has already received multiple literature awards across New England and has even been met with high praises from critics in the American Union State. Charlotte's Web would go on to become one of the highest-selling children's literature with over 50 million copies."

nee.89.t: "Maine Native Indians Given Voting Rights"
nee.89.d: "Breaking News in Maine where the state legislature has approved a voting rights bill for the Native American tribes. Despite the Snyder Act being passed in 1928 allowing Native Americans to vote, the majority of states would not adopt the bill until multiple years later. Maine seems to be the longest holdout in not only New England but across the former United States. While the Maine constitution allows tax-paying Native Americans to vote, the majority of those living in reservations do not pay state taxes.\n\nMaine is home to four tribes known as the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and the Passamaquoddy. These tribes have been petitioning the state legislature since the passage of the Snyder act, yet have been ignored for nearly three decades. However, after facing national pressure, the legislature finally pushed through the Maine Suffrage for Native Americans Act. This act finally granted all Native Americans full coverage of the 14th amendment allowing them to be classified as voting citizens."

nee.90.d: "On August 31st, 1954, Hurricane Carol ravaged the lower New England States, particularly damaging Rhode Island. The tropical storm began its formation on August 25th in the Bahamas and began moving northwest along the Eastern Coast of the American Union State. Nearly a week later it would touchdown in New England on Long Island and would move northeast towards Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n\nThe Government of Rhode Island has declared martial law and deployed the New England Guard to the state to help those affected. So far, Hurricane Carol is the costliest hurricane in New England history with damages at almost 400 million dollars. Hurricane Carol would go on to kill 68 people in New England and 2 in Canada. Nearly 10,000 homes were destroyed and over 400,000 people across New England would go without power for over a week. While Hurricane Carol would eventually dissipate in Quebec on September 1st, New Englanders will certainly not forget the damages and destruction it brought for decades to come."

nee.91.d: "Breaking news out of Connecticut, where the world's first nuclear submarine has been launched out of the port city of Groton. The NENS-1 first began planning in March of 1950, however, would not start construction until over a year later. On December 12th of 1951, the submarine would be named Nautilus after the fictional submarine in Jules Verne's classic novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Over 6 months later, Nautilus' keel would be laid out by former Connecticut Governor Raymond Baldwin during a lengthy ceremony.\n\nWhile taking 2 full years of construction, Nautilus would be fully commissioned and launched on September 30th, 1954. While submarines across the world must come up often to charge their batteries using diesel fuel, with the addition of a nuclear reactor, Nautilus is able to stay submerged for months at a time, only needing to surface for food and water resupplies. While the Reichspakt will certainly produce their own nuclear submarine in a few years, New England has proven its ingenuity in the Kalterkrieg."

Naval Submarine Base New London, which is located on the Thames River directly across from its namesake city in Groton, Connecticut, will be expanded by two square kilometers. This will afford the New London base the space necessary to house several more subs in its new role as the headquarters of the New England Submarine Force. The new docking facilities will be designed with the navy's Seawolf-class attack submarines in mind, the Seawolf-class being the production model of the world's first nuclear submarine NENS Nautilus that was launched last year."

nee.93.d: "New in the field of New England Science as researchers at Yale University have just discovered and named a new hormone found in the human body. Named melatonin, the hormone is proven to help one's circadian rhythm during the sleep-wake cycle. While melatonin was initially discovered in 1917 as a chemical in amphibians and reptiles, the research on melatonin in humans did not begin until the late 1950s.\n\nAlthough the researchers at Yale University began their research looking for a hormone in the pineal gland that could be used to cure skin diseases, it seems that they have found a more significant discovery. With the recent discovery, the race is on for pharmaceutical companies to patent the hormone in a drug format. Through the discovery one thing has been made incredibly clear, New England dominates the scientific community."

nee.94.d: "Just two years after the reformation of Major League Baseball in New England, the color barrier in baseball has been broken. While not formally segregated, baseball has been de facto segregated since the 1880s. That all changed in New England yesterday when Larry Doby struck out as a pinch hitter in the 7th inning of yesterday's game between the Phillies and Braves in Philadelphia. A 3 sport athlete at his high school in New Jersey, Doby played for an amateur team on Long Island before the war. He was drafted into the army of the Combined Syndicates, but managed to survive the war and returned to his native New Jersey where he was granted amnesty along with most former CSA soldiers. He then played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro Leagues. As a new member of the Phillies, Doby received muted cheers in Philadelphia with certain fans clearly not showing their support. Plainclothes officers were in the stands to ensure his safety. With a single at bat, Larry Doby has changed baseball forever."

Created by a team of scientists led by Dr. John Shive, the phototransistor is still in its experimental stages at this time. Despite this, Bell Labs remain confident in the importance and success of their latest invention. The new device has already demonstrated many advantages over existing light cells which tend to be larger, slow to respond, and not as sensitive. A patent for the phototransistor is expected to be filed in the near future after more refinements are made to the design."

nee.96.d: "Automobile transport and the spread of highways across New England is leading to interesting and unique inventions to accommodate this new way of life. The New Jersey Department of Transportation is implementing a new invention called the rumble strip. On the edge of the traffic, small grooves are applied to create vibrations that can be heard by all occupants of the car. This is intended to alert drivers who are distracted or asleep at the wheel that have crossed a traffic line. Already these rumble strips have cut down run-off-road accidents in the state leading to safer transportation. Both neighboring states and the federal government have begun taking steps to implement this new technology on all means of automobile transportation."

nee.98.d: "After years of market research, James Vicary has coined a new form of marketing, subliminal advertisement. This marketing strategy sees companies use words like "drink soda" or "eat popcorn" to increase sales of these products. By showing these quick messages that the sub-conscience picks up on, but the viewer doesn't, consumers are far more likely to purchase the subliminal product. Vicary's research is being pushed by large companies which are truly pushing the boundaries of this new discovery."

nee.99.d: "After a disorganized system prior to the war and even more confusion after it, professional basketball in New England finally has a proper professional league. Named the New England Basketball Association (NEBA). Like Major League Baseball, many teams folded during the war, but are now being resurrected with seed money from investors.The league is being formed with ten teams, and will include teams from Canada and the Great Lakes. The Eastern Division will consist of the Boston Celtics, the Providence Steamrollers, the New York Knicks, the Newark Nets, and the Philadelphia 76ers. The Western Division will be made up of the Toronto Huskies, the Detroit Falcons, the Philadelphia Warriors, the Buffalo Bulls, and the Hartford Hawks. While basketball is not quite as popular as baseball, the promise of linking Canada and the Great Lakes to New England with sports has great promise. The first game will be played between New York and Toronto next month."

British Overseas Aircraft Corporation (BOAC) and its de Havilland DH.106 Comet bear the honor of this historic moment, beating the Boeing 707 to the punch. The flight, which took off from London's Heathrow Airport at 08:45 AM local time, took 10 hours and 20 minutes to land in New York due to making a short refueling stop at Gander Airport in Newfoundland.

Debuting earlier this month, I Love Lucy stars real-life husband and wife Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball as the Ricardo couple. Set in New York City, the show follows the lives of Lucy Ricardo and her bandleader/singer husband Enrique "Ricky" Ricardo. Hijinx abounds as the naïve and ambitious Lucy attempts to follow in her husband's footsteps and break into show business. Estimated to have been seen by over six million people, the premiere of I Love Lucy has exceeded CBS's expectations and it's almost a given that it'll be renewed for a second season. It's also been reported that Desi Arnaz is negotiating with CBS executives to have the show translated into Spanish so that it can be exported to his native Cuba."

nee.105.d: "The Vaccine Advisory Committee has given its approval for a large-scale test of Dr. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine. A refined version of the same vaccine that Dr. Salk gave to himself and his family, this latest iteration will be distributed to roughly one million of New England's schoolchildren in a double-blind experiment. The children selected for the test will be observed for signs of polio infection over the next year by Dr. Salk and his associates in coordination with government health officials. Dr. Salk remains optimistic that his vaccine will be as effective as it was for his family but warns hopeful parents of getting their hopes up.\n\n"Polio is a nasty little thing. It's as resilient as it is ruthless. My vaccine works. There is no questioning that. What we are questioning is just how effective it will be. It may work for all of the children. It may only work for 10% of them. We simply do not know. All I can say is that my team and I have done everything we can to give this vaccine the best chance at success possible. It's in God's hands now.""

nee.106.d: "Breaking news from the capital this afternoon as Secretary of Health and Human Services Marion B. Folsom announced that the New England government would license Dr. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine for use and distribution throughout the nation. This news follows a press conference that Dr. Salk held at New York University this morning. There he revealed that the vaccine he created had been 80-90% effective in a large-scale test conducted last year. This revelation led to the good doctor receiving a standing ovation from those in attendance. With New England being the first nation to formally adopt the Salk vaccine, it seems only logical that other nations will soon follow suit."

nee.108.t: "The State of the State Department"
nee.108.d1: "As the Baldwin administration gets settled with its new congress on Beacon Hill, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles faces tough choices at the State Department. New England's foreign policy has been ramshackle for the decade that it has existed, and Mr. Dulles has been determined to change that. The physical expansion of the bureaucracy has gone alongside New England's expansion of global power. Built on the ruined foundations of the United States, the New England State Department has had to work with a smaller pool of qualified diplomats to draw from, and faces larger diplomatic challenges than the United States ever did.\n\nThe first of these issues is the whole issue of the American successors. The Ottawa Protocols has made it easier to work with the Pacific States of America and Great Lakes Government, but the existence of a an opposition American state which is stronger economically and militarily is an unprecedented development. Because New England and the American Union State do not recognize eachother and have not exchanged ambassadors, it has been difficult to keep the peace the last seven years. It has taken skillful maneuvering in back-channels and a good amount of luck to prevent a 3rd American Civil from breaking out thus far. It will take more to prevent it in the coming decade.\n\nNew England's relationship with Canada and Europe is also brand new. In the interwar years America was an economic backer for the Entente, but to a limited degree.

nee.108.d2: "As the new Harriman administration gets settled on Beacon Hill, new Secretary of State Dean Acheson faces tough choices at the State Department. New England's foreign policy has been ramshackle for the decade that it has existed, and Mr. Acheson has been determined to change that. The physical expansion of the bureaucracy has gone alongside New England's expansion of global power. Built on the ruined foundations of the United States, the New England State Department has had to work with a smaller pool of qualified diplomats to draw from, and faces larger diplomatic challenges than the United States ever did.\n\nThe first of these issues is the whole issue of the American successors. The Ottawa Protocols has made it easier to work with the Pacific States of America and Great Lakes Government, but the existence of a an opposition American state which is stronger economically and militarily is an unprecedented development. Because New England and the American Union State do not recognize eachother and have not exchanged ambassadors, it has been difficult to keep the peace the last seven years. It has taken skillful maneuvering in back-channels and a good amount of luck to prevent a 3rd American Civil from breaking out thus far. It will take more luck to prevent it in the coming decade.\n\nNew England's relationship with Canada and Europe is also brand new. In the interwar years America was an economic backer for the Entente, but to a limited degree. While many New Englanders wish they could put the full weight of their economy into helping the Accord powers in Europe, it has proven more difficult than expected. Between needed commitments to defend against the Union State and New Englands limited resources as a fraction of the former United States, South France and the United Kingdom have often felt wanting for more support from New England.\n\nDespite these challenges, the New England State Department has proven up to the task.

President Lehman was already 75 when he assumed the office of the presidency in 1953, and would be over the age of 80 by the time his term would end in 1961. Lehman's presidency has always been viewed as something of a transition between the old guard of Walsh and Harriman, and younger Democrats like Joseph Clark and John F.

nee_civil.1.d: "“I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch…”\n\nThose were the words of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, printed in the first issue of The Liberator over a century ago. Garrison was from Newburyport, in Massachusetts, and The Liberator was published in Boston; he was only one link in a long, winding chain— ever since the days of Bunker Hill and Sam Adams, New England has been home to America’s radicals, abolitionists, and activists of all stripes.\n\nThis, as expected, has not changed with the coming of the twentieth century, and the passing of yet another Civil War. It is truer than ever, in fact, in a time where civil rights, discrimination, and equality have been pushed to the forefront and laid bare to the average American through years of struggle and an experiment in popular revolution. From Augusta to Philadelphia and everywhere in between, those who have long been denied their rights —women, colored folk, immigrants, Catholics and Jews— are beginning a new chapter in New England’s history of social progress."

nee_civil.2.t: "The founding of the CRC"
nee_civil.2.d: "Even as the dust settles from the recent civil war, America reels from not only the specter of syndicalism but the skeletons from its first civil war. Even as the borders have settled and the liberal and Longist idealogues across them debate the merits of liberty over security, all Americans are faced with an inconvenient truth: systemic racism and discrimination against African American communities. From Boston to San Francisco and Detroit to New Orleans, inequality and discrimination are becoming an unavoidable subject of debate \n\nTo combat these issues, several African American organizations and labor movements have come together to form the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) out of Harlem. Heavily influenced by leftists, they are founding chapters in Philadelphia and other major urban centers. The CRC aims to provide legal and social support to discriminated people to defend civil liberties. Their connection to former radical groups has earned them the ire of many conservatives across the nation, however. Still, an endorsement from Representative Adam Clayton has given them a modicum of legitimacy in the Northeast at least."

nee_civil.3.t: "Philadelphia Transit Strike of '48"
nee_civil.3.d: "News outlets nationwide have been parroting the latest news from Pennsylvania non-stop; following the promotion of eight black workers of the Philadelphia Transportation Company to machinists and conductors in the city's transport system, thousands of white workers under the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union have declared a strike, paralyzing the city's industry. While the PTC claims these promotions were a necessity due to post-war labour shortages and new government anti-discrimination regulations, the PRTEU started the strikes due to the fact that they supposedly violated a contracting clause in the union's contract with the company.\n\nWhile the implications for New England's government are severe, both economically, due to Philadelphia's importance as an industrial centre, and politically, due to the already existing tensions with unions and other "radicals" in the occupied states, it has already become the most charged event in the young nation's history of civil rights; everyone, from the NAACP to the CRC, from conservative Democrats and law-and-order activists to Progressives and rival labour unions, has jumped on the bandwagon to promote their different agendas, and the government has been caught in the crossfires of a strike that has shown the cracks in the supposedly integrated New Englander society."

nee_civil.4.d: "After several days of different offers from the PTC, PRTEU, NAACP, CRC, and many other acronymic organizations, negotiations have stalled, and Philadelphia is still at an impasse. The city's critical industry won't last much longer in this state of standstill and, while the population is calm and generally against the strike, tensions could easily grow if the wrong actions - or none at all - are taken, which could prove catastrophic in the long run.\n\nOne possible solution has become apparent to the cabinet, though; sending in the National Guard to put the city's transport and its industry back on track, under the powers of various wartime acts. However, this would mean caving in to the demands of the NAACP (and, even worse, the CRC) sending a message to the public that the government is willing to take a harder stance on civil rights.\n\nNot sending the National Guard in would result in no compromising promises for the government, but could seem weak to the public, though, and embolden the radicals already embedded in the situation."

nee_civil.5.d: "A few days of calmly sending people home, requisitioning trolleys and subway trains, brandishing machine guns and smoking cigarettes later, the National Guard has successfully pacified the city of Philadelphia, with the strike finally being ended by an ultimatum from the government promising to cut several wartime benefits afforded to unionized workers in Pennsylvania. While there were a few incidents of civil unrest, including one where PRTEU workers drove a streetcar through a black neighborhood, shooting wildly at the streets and mildly injuring a child, and one where a black worker threw a paperweight at the Liberty Bell, the city has remained mostly calm, and has gone back to work (now with soldiers driving and guarding their public transports).\n\nWhile civil rights activists and the black population of Philadelphia have received the news of this show of force from the government warmly, the reception amongst whites and the public in Pennsylvania and New England in general has been definitely more lukewarm; while polls indicate a slim majority of the city's population wouldn't have minded black drivers on their daily commute, most of their concerns were over the strike and its obstruction, and not the civil rights dispute at hand.\n\nFurthermore, the government's actions have been interpreted by activist groups and more progressive politicians as a sign of the government's willingness to advance the cause of civil rights, and are now expectedly demanding further action be taken to fix the cracks in the seemingly ideal Northeastern society."

nee_civil.6.d: "While New England’s general populace is generally content with their position of civil liberties compared to their southern neighbors, it has become increasingly apparent that they are not immune to the mires and pitfalls of systemic racism. Even without the de jure segregation of Jim Crow laws, income disparity and racial discrimination are present in almost every aspect of New Englander society. These so-called infringements on civil rights are not limited to colored communities either but include discrimination against religious minorities like Jews and other fringe groups such as homosexuals and socialists.\n\nNo longer can Boston ignore the elephant in the room; tensions are rising and our government will have to take an official stance on civil rights sooner than later. The voices of activists cannot be ignored any longer. We will either have to draft legislation that specifically protects minority rights, such as integrating them in public schools and spaces, or stand firm with the status quo and trust that the people will do the right thing without government intervention."

Little did they know that the stage had been set in an almost clandestine manner with the informal creation of ‘The Black Cabinet’. While New England’s government hasn’t specifically avoided hiring people of color since its inception, it hasn’t shown a significant interest in it either. This changed, however, under the oversight of Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes who began a process of hiring African Americans to advisory positions within the executive branch. What began as a few appointments has now become a significant voice of representation for the African American community at the highest level of government. \n\nThis so-called ‘Black Cabinet’ has placed dozens of African Americans in places where their voices and contributions could be seriously heard. While this began as a secretive project by Ickes, it has now become a beacon of hope for many civil rights activists who felt otherwise unrepresented in the government they were trying to influence."

Civil Rights activists from across New England came together to discuss a variety of issues regarding race and their growing movement. Despite conservative pundits claiming the CRC is nothing more than a syndicalist sleeper cell, the conference has taken a surprisingly moderate domestic stance in favor of looking south. \n\nWhile the CRC’s leaders all agree that the fight is far from over in the Northeast, the focus of this convention was on the plight of their brothers and sisters within the AUS. CRC leadership made a call for liberation and solidarity with African American communities down south and began to raise awareness of the police brutality and segregation that they suffer daily. Though many still believe the problems at home must be solved before looking abroad, the media is now abuzz with talk about the CRC becoming a potential asset in finding allies within the AUS to help crack the Longist regime."

nee_civil.9.t: "Powell and the NAACP"
nee_civil.9.d: "Our nation’s nascent civil rights movement is but a first step in a long and arduous process. Every victory counts, and big ones like the Celler-Powell Act have laid the foundation for something greater. But even from this foundation, the frameworks of a full national movement must be built. And as momentum grows for more changes, more laws, and even constitutional amendments, so does the opposition. Much of the civil rights movement is steeped in the rhetoric of the left-wing New England Progressive Party and the more organizations like the Civil Rights Congress are connected to the late revolution, the harder it becomes to palate for much of our conservative population. But this predicated entrenchment in leftist politics is in the process of being overturned by none other than the co-author of the Celler-Powell Act himself, Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr.\n\nAdam C. Powell, an African American congressman out of Harlem, started his career as a Democrat on the New York City Council right as the Civil War was ending. He quickly gained influence and became the first black Congressman out of New York, and was one of the first congressmen elected to represent New York City as an independent state. Thus far he has had a respectable career and has quickly become a rockstar among the Democratic Party for his support of their agenda and his push for civil rights. Working closely with New York’s first regional NAACP President Dr. James Egert Allen, he has been a driving force in integrating racial politics into New England’s legislature. It is said that the NAACP acts as ‘the quarterback that threw the ball to Powell, who, to his credit, was more than happy to catch and run with it’ to pass in Congress. With the name recognition garnered from the Celler-Powell Act, he has naturally arisen as the leader of the civil rights movement in New England. He challenges the use of poll taxes and has virtually shut down the casual use of racial slurs in Congress. Working as an establishment Democrat, he has become an agreeable choice for Democrats in both camps as well as the sizable bloc of liberal Republicans within our borders. And in the light of the CRC’s wishy-washy leftism and the uncertainty caused by the Philadelphia Transit Strike, Representative Powell has become a beacon of stable progress for all of New England."
nee_civil.9.a: "What an agreeable bunch!"

nee_civil.10.t: "Like Herding Cats"
nee_civil.10.d: "Thus far, New England has been a shining example of civil rights progress across the former United States. While racism has hardly been removed from our society, Boston has begun to treat itself as a city on a hill that acts as the model form of progress for fixing America’s sins. So far, we have empowered Representative Powell as a civil rights leader, we have passed actionable legislation to back our rhetoric, and have made significant inroads to increase minority voices in our government. And while progress has been above and beyond anyone’s expectations, we are not a monolith.\n\nPowell’s leadership has been a great driving force behind a unified civil rights movement, but even with him at the helm it has been like herding cats to get anything done. Most northeastern Republicans are relatively moderate in regard to social issues, though they have steered budgets towards ‘responsible’ legislation which stymies many aid projects. New England’s Democratic Party has been rapidly championing the cause of social liberalism and catalyzing civil rights legislation, but the conservative old guard are less enthused by diverting party resources to pushing the agenda. Left-wing groups like the Progressive Party and Civil Rights Congress have their own agendas, often pushing labor issues alongside racial ones. And the NAACP sits in the middle with an eagle eyed focus on the African American community. New Englanders can all agree that civil rights will become a staple of free American society; but very few people can actually get along and choose a single path to achieve this result. Congressional debates are often tied up with bureaucratic red tape, and media pundits from all political camps argue day and night over going too far or not far enough. But even with New England’s many interest groups tugging the civil rights question in different directions, movement is still being made. Given enough time and resources, a man as capable as Adam C. Powell will be able to reign in the crowd and drive this energy towards a single and actionable future for the civil rights movement."

nee_civil.11.t: "Radicals Emboldened"
nee_civil.11.d: "After the government's decision to remain out of the conflict in Philadelphia, things decidedly went sour; with the strike prolonged and the PTC-aligned local government refusing to intervene, conflicts between Philadelphia's black population, striking workers and frustrated onlookers have escalated into outright riots. In one of the more unsavory events of the whole ordeal, a group of PRTEU workers drove a streetcar through a black neighborhood, shooting wildly at the streets and onlookers, killing a child and seriously injuring two passersby, which quickly enraged those against the strike into action.\n\nPhiladelphia is now only paralyzed, but in a state of outright chaos, with small clashes and skirmishes occurring all across the city's streets, disturbing the population, black and white, nationwide, and leading to an emboldening of radical groups like the CRC, who have capitalized on the government's lack of action as a justification for their ideology and agenda.\n\nHowever, with their growing popularity and vocality, fissures in the left radical strain of the civil rights movement have begun to show; for example, the fact that this racist strike has been called by an union has been a matter of much debate amongst the labour wings of the movement, showing many of the differences between the mish-mash of groups that form it."

nee_civil.12.t: "An Establishment Alternative?"
nee_civil.12.d: "If New England’s civil rights movement is to get on its feet, we will need to seek out a leader who represents the African American community and is willing to play ball with the establishment. The CRC has proven to be a loud but ineffective organization and is leaving many Americans with cold feet regarding supporting civil rights legislation. The Progressive Party of New England is a respectable organization trusted by hundreds of thousands of our citizens to represent them in Congress, but they fall into an awkward third wheel in the traditional two-party system that we know and love.\n\nWe need to find an establishment alternative to bear the torch for the civil rights movement in our country. Emanuel Celler is a strong proponent of civil rights legislation within our government but as a Jewish man of German heritage, he does not fit the bill of African American leadership. Still, we will have to find someone in the wake of the Celler-Powell Act’s failure. Our government has essentially been on the back foot playing damage control ever since. We need a politician in the Goldilocks zone of not too radical, but not too conservative that New England can get behind and carry the torch of civil rights."
nee_civil.12.a: "We need to find someone."

nee_civil.13.t: "Powell and the NAACP"
nee_civil.13.d: "Our nation’s civil rights movement is finally getting on its feet. Living in the wake of the failure of the Celler-Powell Act and the Philadelphia Transit Strike, many feared that New England would fail its citizens on the matter of liberty and freedom. But we have found our man - a leader that New England can raise to guide us through this civil rights crisis: Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.\n\nRepresentative Adam C. Powell was the co-author of the ill-fated Celler-Powell Act, and perhaps the obvious choice for the government to sponsor as a civil rights leader. An African American congressman out of Harlem, Powell started his career as a Democrat on the New York City Council right as the Civil War ended. He quickly gained influence and became the first black Congressman out of New York, and was one of the first congressmen elected to represent New York City as an independent state. Thus far he has had a career as a bit of a rebel in the Democratic party in his push for civil rights legislation. Working closely with New York’s first regional NAACP President Dr. James Egert Allen, he has been a driving force in integrating racial politics into New England’s legislature. It is said that the NAACP acts as ‘the quarterback that threw the ball to Powell, who, to his credit, was more than happy to catch and run with it’ to pass in Congress. He challenges the use of poll taxes and has virtually shut down the casual use of racial slurs in Congress. Working as an establishment Democrat, he has become an agreeable choice for Democrats in both camps as well as the sizable bloc of liberal Republicans within our borders.

nee_civil.14.t: "CRC National Conference, [GetYear]"
nee_civil.14.d: "The Civil Rights Congress held its first National Conference this week and chose Harlem’s very own Hotel Theresa as its venue. This historic hotel, once a whites-only establishment, had become part of the beating heart of the Harlem Renaissance. And while it once again acts as a dignified place of business, it was co-opted as a base for syndicalist revolutionaries before the liberation of New York City. Civil Rights activists from across New England came together to discuss a variety of issues regarding race and their growing movement. Black voices from all political camps have gathered to plan the future of civil rights, but many are believed to harbor loyalty to last decade’s ill fated revolution. With anger in New England’s African American community at an all time high, much of the media is now worried this will be another revolutionary hub.\n\nCRC membership is surging now as the civil rights movement has been left without actionable help from the federal government. When Boston favored the status quo over the Celler-Powell Act, the African American community took this as an abandonment of civil rights entirely. Exacerbated by the chaos of the Philadelphia Transit Union Strike, the demand for action has only gotten greater. With expanded chapters in Philadelphia and Bridgeport, the CRC is now a force to be reckoned with. Now unified behind a position of focusing on New England’s systemic problems, only a small portion of the conference was dedicated to the plight of the oppressed African American communities within the AUS. Alongside significant political backing from the Progressive Party of New England, the CRC discussed modeling future civil rights activity on the Transit Union Strike. The organization’s origins in radical labor groups may have become one of its greatest assets. New England might not have any choice but to acknowledge the CRC’s demands now."
nee_civil.14.a: "In defense of the self-evident truths!"

nee_civil.15.t: "Collaboration with the CBI?"
nee_civil.15.d: "The national civil rights debate has gone from a simmer to a full-blown boil in recent months. Some of this has been to the nation’s benefit as firm rhetoric from establishment leaders like Representative Powell has helped put New England on a respectable path. But other movements like the radicalization of the Civil Rights Congress and the Philadelphia Transit Strike have begun to dig up memories of the late revolution and civil war. New Englanders have prided themselves in the last few decades on their ability to uphold the rule of law, but it is now becoming painfully clear that even legal idealism has not been enough to assuage the public’s fears. Moreover, the radicalization of civil rights groups has begun to raise some serious public safety concerns within our government. Can we afford another riot? Could a strike have been prevented if known agitators were watched more closely? Our constitution guarantees the right to free speech, but it could be said that bad actors are taking advantage of New England’s civility and using free speech as a cover for performing crimes in the name of social justice.\n\nQuietly, members of our government have begun to propose a radical new public safety bill that would streamline some of the barriers between the Commonwealth Bureau of Investigation and New England’s court system. Championed by Maine’s Senator Owen Brewster, this bill would primarily focus on reducing the scrutiny required for signing search warrants against former syndicalist sympathizers and prior offenders. Beacon Hill has not publicly acknowledged such measures thus far, but there is mounting pressure from the public to act before the civil unrest becomes a national security threat. This directive would not grant any arresting power but act as a sweeping surveillance measure that will enable the CBI to build cases against agitators before anybody gets hurt. New England stands behind the civil rights movement, but some bad actors have the potential to corrupt its platform towards one of unlawful extremism. Brewster’s confidants have assured [NEE.getleader]’s cabinet that these measures would only be used against bad actors, but opponents have referred to this empowerment of the CBI as a Longist surveillance state measure. But if we do not support this, we will certainly be blamed for inaction if a future crime could have been prevented with this bill."

nee_civil.16.t: "Quelling Radicalism"
nee_civil.16.d: "A bit of good news has finally come out of the CBI task force created to monitor bad actors within the civil rights movement! After several months of surveillance, CBI operatives have built a case against a network of agitators within the various civil rights organizations. While none of these individuals would be considered leaders within the CRC, NAACP, or major labor unions, they have positioned themselves as advisors and influencers within these organizations. While New England firmly supports the right to free speech and open protest, these former syndicalists have been observed fanning the flames of violent protest and in some cases have even been found stockpiling weapons. Photo evidence and radical literature discovered through Brewster’s new warrant system will be more than enough to convince a jury that these men are not well-meaning protestors but violent agitators.\n\nThe CBI’s new powers have not been without opposition, however. Watchdog groups have already begun building a legal case to expose these surveillance measures as unconstitutional. But a case like this will likely need to go all the way up to the Supreme Court which will mean years of legal red tape. In the meantime, these radicals will be tied up in their legal battles on charges of conspiracy to instigate riots. Civil rights groups will likely be forced to cut ties with these revolutionaries if they want to keep their movement focused on racial issues.\n\nAs New England comes to terms with the precedent this has set for the nation, our citizens can at least rest easy as the radical elements of the civil rights movement have been dealt with. With the bad actors pruned from the movement, the slow and peaceful path lies ahead for New England’s civil rights movement. Law abiding citizens can now show their support through the proper legal channels without fear of their work being twisted into a new revolution. And when New England finally does achieve change, it will not be at the behest of radicals and agitators but through the constitutional process laid forth by our forefathers."

nee_civil.17.t: "The March for Integration"
nee_civil.17.d: "New England’s inaction in the civil rights movement has finally hit a flashpoint that we can no longer ignore. When activists pushed the Celler-Powell Act, Beacon Hill left them out to dry in favor of trusting New Englanders to do the right thing. After radicalism grew in the light of inaction, Congress backpedaled by entrusting Adam C. Powell in a leadership role. When given the opportunity to crack down on radicalism in the civil rights movement, those in power opted to take the high road and let sleeping dogs lie. And through inaction and backpedaling, here we stand…\n\nWith no assurance from the federal government, NAACP leadership planned the largest organized march in American history. Roughly 50,000 people, majority black but supported by their white allies, followed Dr. James Egert Allen in support of the racial integration of public spaces and schools across all of New England. This march was planned to start in the largely African American neighborhood of Roxbury, Boston, and make its way to Beacon Hill. Their goal was to show Congress and President [NEE.getleader] that the people of New England now demand action be taken to heed their demands. The March for Integration was meant to act as the catalyst for a much greater movement of protests and solidarity marches to force change in New England. The result, however, was something of a disaster…\n\nThe march made its way through Roxbury without significant incident but was roadblocked by construction before it could enter the south end. As the protest leaders argued with construction crews and tried to chart a new course, members of the crowd began to get riled up as members of the CRC started to decry this as an intentional tactic by the city to box the march to a black neighborhood. The longer people waited, the more upset they became and it was already too late by the time Dr. Allen was able to chart a new course. Boston Police increased its presence during this buildup period while the nearly 400 reporters documenting the events began to capture this historic disaster./n/nProtesters began to attempt to dismantle the roadblocks, injuring several construction workers as their scaffolding was destabilized in the push. The increased police presence wasted no time stepping in as the crews began to fight back. Additional police forces moved to block the alternate routes out of Roxbury in response to the clash at the roadblock, effectively trapping tens of thousands of people in the neighborhood. Panic and anger grew into a riot as radicals and moderates were cramped together in the narrow streets of Roxbury. Blue Hill Avenue was looted, dozens of homes had windows broken, and by the time the riot was over it became clear that this neighborhood might never recover. And with all of the reporters present, the damage will be visible across the entire world…"

nee_civil.18.t: "Pearl-clutching"
nee_civil.18.d: "Who is to blame? New England is still reeling from the Roxbury Riot three months ago and the media has only profited from the controversy. While Representative Powell has denounced several prominent bad actors who agitated the protestors, he has spearheaded an investigation into the Boston P.D. for its ‘unconscionable overreaction’ as he put it. Dr. Allen has galvanized the outrage of the African American community to push his civil rights agenda. Conservatives across the Republicans and Democrats have placed the blame squarely on the syndicalist radicals within the CRC and have been using this as a rallying cry for increased funding for law enforcement. Meanwhile, Boston’s city planner is under investigation for sabotaging the march and the federal government has been thoroughly embarrassed among its peers and rivals across America.\n\nAnd through it all, the media has fanned the flames of outrage. Pundits on both sides are using the disaster to justify their positions and polarize New England. While the Roxbury Riot was a tragedy, it has been co-opted by just about everyone with an agenda from civil rights activists to law enforcement. This has been an event to be mourned and learned from but has instead been relegated as a tool for political agendas. And despite everything, no progress has been made by either the civil rights movement or its growing opposition. The only thing growing is the sense of distrust among New England’s urban communities. Communities like Harlem and South Philadelphia have become somewhat isolated from their neighboring white neighborhoods and minority arrests have seen an increase as local police departments are desperate to avoid a riot in their cities. The damage to the nation is far more than physical and this rift will likely take far longer to repair than a few broken windows."

Civil rights leaders have been radicalized by our inaction and our communities have suffered for it. Trust in our government is at an all-time low and we are now faced with a decision that will define the social climate of New England for a generation. We can return to the drawing board on the Celler-Powell Act with broader language and label it the Civil Rights Act of [GetYear]. By outlawing the exclusion of any person from public spaces on the basis of race or creed, we will be giving the civil rights leaders the victory they have been looking for. But if we give them an inch then they will demand a mile, and the opposition question whether or not our government can even afford the resources required to enforce such legislation.\n\nThis opposition, headed by New England’s most conservative leaders, insists that the issue of civil rights is a state issue. They say that New England’s federal government should focus on the big picture issues like pushing for Accord leadership and preparing the nation for a potential continuation war. The AUS is the real oppressor and New England’s resources could be better spent on the liberation of all oppressed peoples under Longist tyranny rather than clogging the court system with petty exclusionary lawsuits. In that light, the conservative dialogue has pushed the narrative to one that would put the burden of civil rights to the state level so the nation as a whole can focus on the existential threat in the South.\n\nSo we must choose. There is no more room for half-measures or middle-road inaction. Beacon Hill must now decide between endorsing the civil rights movement by devoting resources to pass the Civil Rights Act of [GetYear], or firmly endorsing a policy of divesting the civil rights issues to the individual state governments. This will likely establish a precedent that will frame New England’s domestic policy for the duration of the Cold War. Will we fight for civil rights, or will we say no to federal intervention?"

nee_civil.20.t: "East Harlem's Syndicalist"
nee_civil.20.d: "It is no secret that New England’s civil rights movement is heavily associated with former syndicalists and left-wing demagogues. New York City was both a hub for the syndicalist revolution and the center of African American population and culture in the northeast. And because of our government’s enshrined right to democratic elections, it has become quite impossible to truly remove the specter of syndicalism from New England. With the assimilation of New York’s American Labor Party into the establishment aligned New England Progressive Party, many socialists now operate with the full legal protection of our government. Among these leftist specters in our government, none are quite as prolific as East Harlem’s congressional representative Vito Marcantonio.\n\nAs a representative of Harlem, Vito Marcantonio has spent his entire career fending off the Democratic wolves sent by Tammany Hall for his congressional seat. With a progressive platform of labor rights and racial equality, he has become the hero of Harlem's working class. As one of the State of New York City’s first congressional representatives to New England Congress, he has worked tirelessly to ensure the unions and minorities of New York are not forgotten in the wake of the Civil War. He has a particular affinity for the African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Jews of New York City and has utilized his position to protect their interests in this new political climate. He is credited with convincing then Connecticut Governor Raymond Baldwin to end poll taxes in his state and has relentlessly pressured Beacon Hill to outlaw them on a federal level to supersede Vermont and Maine on the matter. He was also a driving force behind making lynching a federal crime in New England.\n\nWhile we were at war with the syndicalists less than a decade ago, we now have learned to work and even thrive with them in our government. But he is also tied to labor leaders so he holds a nuclear option against Congress. As he pushes his civil rights agenda, he is more than capable of utilizing his union connections to organize strikes and protests at a moment’s notice. And in a climate where Longism is considered more dangerous than socialism, we must grin and bear his progressive agenda lest we see what he’s capable of. It’s not like we could remove him from office if we tried!"
nee_civil.20.a: "Why are we even funding the NYPD?"

nee_civil.21.t: "The Neorriqueños"
nee_civil.21.d: "New York City has always been the quintessential melting pot of cultures and ideas. ‘Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free’ is as Emma Lazarus’ New Colossus goes, and with it drives the foundation by which New York City strives to be the best city in the world. But this city is not simply one of Italians, Jews, and Irish. Nor are the only minorities in New York of African descent. The Neorriqueños, or Nuyoricans, is what Spanish speaking communities refer to New York’s Puerto Ricans. Though often seen as immigrants, Puerto Ricans were given US citizenship from 1917-1937 when the United States ceased to exist and lost its influence on Puerto Rico. But between the initial half-century of migration and some refugees escaping the island’s harsh government in the 40s, the Neorriqueños have become an estimated 4% to 7% of New York City’s population.\n\nThe Neorriqueños are primarily centered in Manhattan in the areas known as Spanish Harlem and Loisaida. And it is no wonder that they have become an increasingly vocal group as Harlem has become the beating heart of New England’s civil rights movement. Even with champions like Vito Marcantonio carrying their voices to Congress, the Puerto Rican community is discriminated against in many of the same ways as the African Americans’. Banks are less likely to give loans to any people of color, and their desire to preserve the use of the Spanish language in their communities is often met by scrutiny by their monolingual neighbors. And despite these hardships, their communities have grown and even thrived in the post-war era. And through it all their communities have thrived with street art and galleries devoted to their unique cultural experience. In many ways, this has begun to shift the expected visual of what a New York City street might look like and not everybody is looking to change the face of the city. But this expression and their perseverance through everything the world has thrown at them is being used as a tool to uplift all Puerto Rican communities across New England."

nee_civil.22.t: "The New Jersey Klan"
nee_civil.22.d: "When the average person thinks of the Klu Klux Klan, an image of a Southern patriarch in a white hood will often come to mind. And as much as the northerners would like this to be the case, the northeast has been a long-time hotbed for KKK activity. Before the Civil War, the KKK had tens of thousands of members across New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania alone. But as the chaos of the Civil War broke out, much of the northern Klan was slaughtered by Syndicalist militias and even more joined the Minutemen and fled south to Longist territory. Those who remained either kept their heads low in New Jersey after the war or moved to the secluded rural areas of Upstate New York and Maine. As New England’s demographics shifted to majority Catholic once America’s new borders were settled, the Klan began to bide its time with public scrutiny at an all-time high.\n\nHowever, there has been a noticeable increase in KKK activity now that New Jersey has regained statehood. In the last five months, there have been a reported eleven cross burnings outside African American churches, as well as one at each synagogue and catholic church. These activities have thus far been limited to South Jersey with the majority of incidents occurring in Salem County, their new base of operations. In response to this rejuvenated Klan, New Jersey’s governor has increased funding for the New Jersey State Police and created a task force to investigate their criminal activity. What is perhaps more disturbing is the possibility that their position on the AUS border is no coincidence at all. It is speculated that not only their ranks have been bolstered by repatriated minutemen loyal to AFP, but that their criminal activities have been funded by a smuggling operation across the Delaware River. An increased presence of AUS manufactured goods like Coca-Cola and Colt firearms has alerted the attention of federal law enforcement. New Englanders now look on with trepidation as the KKK might be heralding a much larger Longist threat."
nee_civil.22.a: "Old hate never dies..."

nee_civil.23.t: "The Second Knights of the Flaming Circle"
nee_civil.23.d: "With the ongoing conflict between the New Jersey State Police and the KKK, the cross burnings and death threats to Catholic and African American communities have only increased. New Jersey’s Klan has become emboldened by its battles with law enforcement and seems to have used this as an excuse to run wild. With their operations spreading into Pennsylvania as well, a third party has entered into the conflict: The Second Knights of the Flaming Circle.\n\nTaking their namesake from the burning crosses placed outside of their churches, this Catholic vigilante group was revived in response to the resurgence of Klan activity in New Jersey. With Klan sympathizers often holding roles of sheriff or even judges in South Jersey, The Knights believe they cannot rely solely on law enforcement to protect them. They collaborate with unions and recruit the unemployed to stage coordinated, armed counterattacks to protect minority communities as well as their own catholic churches. While the governor has denounced vigilante justice, few people can argue with their results. Courier News reports that New Jersey’s African Americans trust the Knights more than the State Police and are willing to join them on patrol. In a bizarre turn of events, this has somewhat increased trust between black and white communities who have begun to shed blood together in arms against the KKK. Still, the National Guard has been called in on at least one occasion to intervene in Knights activities to prevent South Jersey from becoming a lawless battlefield.\n\nOn the national stage, pundits debate whether or not The Knights of the Flaming Circle are some sort of civil rights crusaders or lawless vigilantes impeding anti-Longist investigations. No courts can jail the citizens' arrests made by the Knights and their raids cause the other Klan cells to go to ground, making it harder for the police to build their cases. Despite this, the other KKK chapters further north have notably kept their heads down since the formation of the Second Knights of the Flaming Circle. Perhaps they are afraid of being arrested as a consequence of the gray scare, or maybe they’re shaking in their boots thinking about a broken jaw and extended hospital stay courtesy of the Knights of the Flaming Circle."

nee_civil.24.t: "The Little Flower"
nee_civil.24.d: "The state of New York City has been somewhat of a black sheep within New England. Once a hotbed of syndicalist activity and now the first new state formed in America since 1912, it has become the de facto progressive heart of New England. And at its helm is the northeast’s scion of progressive politics, Fiorello La Guardia. Known affectionately as ‘the Little Flower’ due to the Italian meaning of his namesake, Fiorello, this roughly 5ft politician has had nothing short of a giant impact on New York and New England as a whole. His career has spanned nearly 30 years but almost ended with his tenure as the 99th Mayor of New York City in the years leading up to the recent civil war. Known in the 30s as a Socialist Republican, he had a fascinating political journey that brought him from Acting Governor of New York City & Long Island in 1940 to the first elected governor of the State of New York City in 1946. He now champions the Progressive Party and has used his political prowess and connections to reconcile New York City’s revolutionary history and legitimize the Progressive Party’s left-wing politics on the national state.\n\nLa Guardia has been hailed as a leading figure in the civil rights movement, often personally visiting African American neighborhoods and holding the NYPD accountable for discriminatory practices. One of his first acts as governor was to pass the Ives-Quinn Act which declared employment without discrimination as a civil right in the State of New York City. It additionally created the State Commission Against Discrimination and has been the most comprehensive ban on racial and religious discrimination ever seen in New England or America as a whole. Among its many benefits, this enabled Baseball All-Star Jackie Robinson to be signed onto the Brooklyn Dodgers and become a New Englander icon for racial integration.\n\nDespite his ailing health, La Guardia has been nothing short of a force of nature on the political scene. He is supportive of African Americans and a terror to anti-semites. He is a scion of New York’s Italian American community while striking hard against the Italian crime families. As a staunch anti-Longist and proponent of New England’s involvement in the Accord, he has transformed the Progressive Party into a patriotic force for good. And with New York City’s meteoric recovery from the Civil War, his racial integration policies have been eyed for adoption at the national level. The only question is whether or not his influence can truly reach beyond the borders of New York City."
nee_civil.24.a: "Up and at 'em, Mr. La Guardia."

nee_civil.25.t: "Almost Lily-whites"
nee_civil.25.d: "Any good businessman will tell you that they only hire the best candidates for their employees. After all, only the most qualified people should be considered for a role. And any politician worth his salt should tell you that only the most capable people should be put in leadership positions. But as New England comes to terms with its new racial reality, people have begun to question who exactly are the best people for any given role. Conservative leaders in both the political and business sectors will be quick to point out that integration for integration’s sake is a meaningless gesture that deprives customers and constituents of the highest quality results. Progressive pundits on the other hand will point out that actively overlooking minority candidates is akin to ignoring the applications of potentially superior candidates. While the tides have generally been turning in favor of integration in New England, it is clear that the conservatives of the upper class have had a significant impact on national hiring practices.\n\nEven with New England’s obvious white majority, people of color are massively under-represented in the workforce. Even more so in the business sector and the political sphere. And while the call for integration has never been louder, it is blatantly clear that New England is still not above these de facto segregation tactics. With little to no regulation on hiring practices at the national level, there is very little anyone can do but take the employers at their word when they say they’re only hiring the best. This trend mirrors the Lily-White movement from the 1880s where the Republican Party began to curry favor with southern politicians by ousting black politicians from their posts. And while this new wave of Lily-Whites is more focused on the private sector, it exposes the dark underbelly of New England’s systemic issues with racism and discrimination."

nee_civil.26.t: "Sedition? In MY White Neighborhood?"
nee_civil.26.d: "It is an open secret that New Jersey has been something of a hotbed for Longist sympathizers for quite some time. Going back to its liberation in 1939, New Jersey was the only part of the country where our government faced active opposition from pro-Long forces. America First Party had a significant hold over New Jersey politics and several Minutemen militias operated out of Wall Township and Keyport. Even after our de-longification efforts over the past decade, New Jersey has remained something of the black sheep in New England’s flock of liberal states. So to some, it comes as little surprise that elements of South Jersey's conservative populace have become disenfranchised by the liberal policies of our government. With the Democrats rapidly adapting to the call for progressive social programs and the northeastern Republicans focusing more on moderate liberalism, some radical conservatives have begun to look south for an alternative to Beacon Hill.\n\nSeeing the inevitably of racial integration out of Boston, these South Jersey conservatives have adopted the moniker First Sons of New Jersey. While it started as whispers, this movement has been rapidly gaining momentum in supporting its one agenda: transfer South Jersey to the Longist government of the American Union State! Officially, NATO governments only acknowledge the existence of the Longist government as a rebel occupation of the United States of America. So for New Englanders to organize such a seditious movement is a huge blow against our legitimacy. While they are free to exercise their First Amendment right to discuss political opinions, any actions to reach out to the rebel government would be considered treason. With the suspected use of the KKK as a smuggling ring into our borders, the Commonwealth Bureau of Investigation has focused all of its attention on this new threat. Even New England’s staunchest opponents to civil rights typically oppose the AFP occupation of half the country, but the First Sons of New Jersey seem to believe that the Longists are their best bet to prolong segregation. The only bright side, if one can even say it, is that this frames segregation as a staple of Longist tyranny. While our government cannot allow sedition of any kind, this has swayed public support massively in favor of integration to prove New England has the moral high ground against the American Union State."
nee_civil.26.a: "They're nothing but no-good Longists!"

nee_civil.27.t: "Friendly Neighborhood Crackdown"
nee_civil.27.d: "In light of the growing tensions in South Jersey, the Commonwealth Bureau of Investigation has officially created a task force to shut down seditious KKK activities. After cooperating with the New Jersey State Police, the CBI has been able to connect the New Jersey Klan to the First Sons of New Jersey and the Longist smuggling ring. Additionally, they worked alongside the IRS to prove a series of tax crimes against Klan leadership who might not otherwise have been directly connected to the violent crimes. Brokering no seditious behavior, the federal government authorized the largest law enforcement operation in the history of New England.\n\nTo ensure the success of this operation, over 250 federal agents and 150 New Jersey State Police were deployed all across the state in the dead of night. National Guard units were also on standby to support as well. Imperial Wizard of the New England Klu Klux Klan, Alton Milford Young, was arrested in his home at 2:33 am on treason charges and his properties were seized under tax liens for failure to report Klan income. New Jersey’s Grand Dragon, Arthur Hornbui Bell, was arrested alongside 45 other klansmen who were preparing for a raid at 2:56 am. By 3:30 am, nearly 600 KKK members and First Sons of New Jersey had been arrested, and by 6:00 am most had been transferred to Trenton State Prison for processing. The network’s top organizers, including Young and Bell, were escorted by armed CBI agents to a train and delivered to Boston at 12:35 pm today to face federal charges.\n\nWhile this was certainly a victory, it is a bittersweet one. This has been the first fighting on New England’s soil in over a decade, and hundreds of men have been put behind bars. Even though they were seditious criminals, they were members of the community as well. Sheriffs, judges, butchers, teachers, and politicians. A few broken doors and windows are the least of South Jersey’s problems in the face of the massive vacuum created when these men were removed from society. It would be easier if these were just villains sent from the AUS to infiltrate our country, but most were citizens of New Jersey first. And while the African American community can sleep easy for the first time in months, the rest of the country has to come to terms with how these people were their friends and neighbors. This may not be the nail in the coffin for New England’s KKK, but the arrest of their Imperial Wizard and the decimation of the New Jersey chapter will certainly put an end to cross burnings and murders long enough for their despicable organization to crumble into irrelevance."

It will be advantageous to focus on building low level contacts before attempting to flip upper level officials. Depending on how the operation goes, Pennsylvania could either peacefully reunite with us or be in a position where we can intervene and bring them back into the fold. We obviously can't predict how the Union State would respond to any of this. Best case scenario, they let Pennsylvania go.

While initially hesitant, and worried that the plan was too vulnerable to Unionist officials and Federal troops stationed in Pennsylvania, the overwhelming numbers that the CIA presented him was enough to win him over.\n\nOnce the plan launches, the governors mansion will become the HQ for the operation, with instructions from the CIA flowing to the Governor, to the National Guard and agents in the field. With the governor on our side, surely the plan will succeed."
nee_ge.13.a: "Excellent"

nee_ge.14.t: "The Mission to Flip the Governor of Pennsylvania Fails"
nee_ge.14.d: "Last night CIA agents, the Pennsylvania National Guard commanders, and members of state government met with the governor at his residence. They presented him with evidence of the entire network the CIA has built over the last year or more, as well as New England's plan to flip Pennsylvania. It became quite clear that the governor was not sympathic. Despite the nework that the CIA has built, it was not enough to convinve the Governor.\n\nIt is not clear what he will do with this information, but without the Governor's cooperation the plan is sure to fail. It is clear that Operation Gray Eyes must be scuttled and that CIA agents and assets should be evacuated back to New England as soon as possible."
nee_ge.14.a: "What a disaster!"

nee_ge.15.t: "The Beginning of Operation Gray Eyes"
nee_ge.15.d: "The CIA reports that they are ready to commence Operation Gray Eyes. Networks have been built, escape routes have been planned, and bribes have been paid. All that's required now is a greenlight from the President."
nee_ge.15.a: "Down with the traitors, up with the stars!"

nee_ge.16.t: "The Secret Meeting"
nee_ge.16.d: "In various meetings across Pennsylvania, CIA agents met with assets in dark basements, abandoned warehouses, and dimly lit offices. The following instructions were given to assets and by the CIA agents:\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, CHICKADEE has given the greenlight. Your missions are enclosed within these envelopes. You are to commit the details of your assigned tasks to memory or transcribe them elsewhere in a manner that is only discernible to you. Once that is completed, you are to burn your envelope and its contents. Under no circumstances can any of the information held within be allowed to fall into enemy hands. You have all spent the last several weeks training for this day. I have complete confidence in each and everyone of you. God willing, your missions will be a success and that we'll all make it out of this alive. Never forget that what you do, you do for the betterment of us all. Good night and good luck.""
nee_ge.16.a: "This is where the fun begins"

nee_ge.17.t: "D-Day"
nee_ge.17.d: "Following the events of yesterday, CIA Director Allen Dulles presented the following report to President [NEE.GetLeader]:\n\nThe meetings the night before went well. Instructions were given and as far as we can be sure, there were no leaks. The events of the day started with a raid on HQs for Unionist Federal Divisions stationed in Pennsylvania. Some generals and upper commanders were captured, decapitating some of the units stationed in the state, but many did not go according to plan. While some federal units may be paralyzed, many others are still operational. With instruction from the Governor, Pittsburg Police and National Guard units seized federal buildings including the court house, administrative buildings, and field offices for the FBI.\n\nBy the end of the day, much of the state was under our control. While Federal Units began to respond by the mid-afternoon, they are unsure of where to start. Only in the evening, did they receive orders from New Orleans to consider Pennsylvania National Guard Units to be enemy troops. Even still, with Pittsburg under our control, it may take a while for Federal troops to respond from other locations. The day went as well as it could have.\n\nOur hope is that in the coming days, the National Guard will be able to hold key positions itself, and that New Orleans will see the state as a lost cause, allowing us to move in peacefully and annex the state. However, if fighting drags out, or if New Orleans hopes to fight this out, this may spiral into total war."
nee_ge.17.a: "A day of days"

nee_ge.18.t: "Unionist Federal Units Clash with PA Guard Troops"
nee_ge.18.d: "We have received reports that Union federal troops have begun to clash with the Pennsylvania National Guard. While the cities still hold, the quality of the Federal Troops is much stronger and they cannot hope to hold out for long. The stability of the state has degraded significantly as a result and we may have to move into secure the territory shortly."
nee_ge.18.a: "Was this in the plan?"

nee_ge.19.t: "Distress Reports from Pennsylvania"
nee_ge.19.d: "We have received reports that the situation in Pennsylvania has reached a point of no return. We can either move into the state ourselves or standby and watch things unfold. Success is not guaranteed either way."
nee_ge.19.a: "Move into the state"
nee_ge.19.b: "It would be too aggressive"

nee_ge.20.t: "New England Moves in to Assist the PA National Guard"
nee_ge.20.d: "Cables from Boston have detailed the inevitable. With the Pennsylvania National Guard fighting a losing battle against American Union State Federal Units, New England has ordered the army into the state to secure what they say is a state exercising its right to self-determination. The Union State meanwhile argues that this is an illegal annexation. Regardless, with New England soldiers and Union State units set to clash, how this is perceived internationally will likely not matter soon."
nee_ge.20.a: "Surely war is inevitable now"

nee_ge.21.t: "The Union State Backs Down!"
nee_ge.21.d: "Following a surprise defeat of Federal Units outside Erie, and with the tide clearly turning against the Union State, President [TEX.GetLeader] announced that he would be withdrawing all federal personnel from the state and ceding it to New England effective at 12:01 AM the day after tomorrow. With the economies of the NATO countries growing much faster than the Union State, it is clear that they are not ready to fight a total war on 3 fronts. While there is not much reason to hope that conditions will improve for the Union State in the coming years, it is clear that they would lose such a confrontation at present. Resolving that they would one day return, Federal units left the Keystone state, uniting it under New England."
nee_ge.21.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!"

nee_ge.22.t: "Pennsylvania Guard Units Retreat to Fight a Guerilla War"
nee_ge.22.d: "We have received reports that the Pennsylvania National Guard backed by New England have lost the upper hand in clashes with Federal Units. Remaining units have retreated to the countryside in the face of overwhelming opposition from Federal troops. A long drawn out guerilla campaign is expected to begin shortly."
nee_ge.22.a: "Seems like a losing battle"

nee_ge.23.t: "This plot was an act of war!"
nee_ge.23.d: "Even though New England's attempt to seize Pennsylvania failed, there can be no doubt of their intentions. This crime cannot stand."
nee_ge.23.a: "May God save us"

nee_ge.24.t: "New England Units Arrive"
nee_ge.24.d: "After our Federal Units began to overwhelm Pennsylvania National Guard troops, New England divisions have crossed the border and are now invading Pennsylvania. Boston claims that this is in response to Pennsylvania's clear right to determine their government. This aggressive act is clearly an act of war, and we can respond in kind."
nee_ge.24.a: "We cannot risk war, we must concede the state"
nee_ge.24.b: "If they want war, they shall have it!"

nee_ge.25.t: "Whispers of a plot"
nee_ge.25.d: "Scattered reports from unconnected sources across Pennsylvania have begun to trickle into New Orleans. Some claim that New England is preparing for outright invasion, others claim that their intentions are much more sinister. While these reports are all unconfirmed, we must prepare for whatever they are planning."
nee_ge.25.a: "Interesting"

nee_ge.26.t: "It all unravels"
nee_ge.26.d: "We now have a confirmed picture of what New England is planning for Pennsylvania. In what they are calling "Operation Gray Eyes," they intend to turn key members of state government, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and even the Governor himself to New England hoping to seize the state for themselves. While this annexation would clearly be illegal, they hope to seize the state before we have a chance to respond all in the hopes that we will simply let their illegal land grab slide. They are not yet aware we know of their plans. If we arrest suspected traitors, it would likely avert war and deal a blow to New England, though not a fatal one. If we were able to stop the operation while it is ungoing and surprise New England, then they could be dealt a major blow, though the operation may still succeed."
nee_ge.26.a: "We must remain quiet"
nee_ge.26.b: "We must Arrest Suspected Traitors"

nee_ge.27.t: "The Operation Unravels"
nee_ge.27.d: "The CIA reports that the Union State has become fully aware of Operation Gray Eyes. They're still working to find out how this has happened but an accidental leak or deliberate sabotage from one or our own is the most likely cause. We can attempt to fabricate that this was all inspired by Pennsylvanians attempting to choose their own government, or deny everything and scrap the operation."
nee_ge.27.a: "They are just exercising their rights to determine their government!"
nee_ge.27.b: "We must deny everything"

nee_ge.28.t: "New England Claims Dominion over Pennsylvania"
nee_ge.28.d: "Following the failure of New England to seize Pennsylvania through Operation Gray Eyes they have decided to further escalate the situation. They claim that it was not a CIA operation, but rather  Pennsylvanians instead exercising their right to self determination and choosing to join New England. With this in mind, New England has claimed dominion over Pennsylvania, arguing that it is a part of New England and should join. New England has demanded that the American Union State allow Pennsylvania to join New England as it clearly desires to, or face the consequences."
nee_ge.28.a: "A Bold Step"
nee_ge.28.b: "We cannot fight New England at the moment"
nee_ge.28.c: "We dont back down!"

nee_ge.29.t: "The Union State Backs Down"
nee_ge.29.d: "Following New England's announcement that they claim dominion over Pennsylvania, the Union government announced that while they do not recognize the annexation, they cannot contest it at the moment. Believing that they would lose a war against the other three American successors, New Orleans has decided to engage in a tactical retreat and withdraw from Pennsylvania."
nee_ge.29.a: "A surprise to be sure"

nee_ge.30.t: "New England Denies Involvement in the Pennsylvania Plot"
nee_ge.30.d: "Following the failure of Operation Gray Eyes, New England has denied any involvement and claims that the whole thing was entirely organized and executed by the Pennsylvania National Guard. While it is clear that they could never have pulled off such a complex plot, New England maintains their innocence. Regardless of what New England claims, the American Union State has the proof it needs to declare war."
nee_ge.30.a: "A Bold Step"
nee_ge.30.b: "We cannot fight New England at the moment"
nee_ge.30.c: "We have proof, this means war!"

nee_ge.31.t: "New England Launches the Pennsylvania Plot"
nee_ge.31.d: "We have received word from one of our informants in the inner circle of Operation Gray Eyes that New England has given instructions to CIA agents and the operation is set to commence tomorrow. Our agents have been working on a plan to counter theirs and it will be put in motion shortly."
nee_ge.31.a: "We have them now"

nee_ge.32.t: "D-Day"
nee_ge.32.d: "Following the events of yesterday, CIA Director Allen Dulles presented the following report to President [NEE.GetLeader]:\n\nThe meetings the night before went well. Instructions were given however there may have been a mole. The events of the day started with a raid on HQs for Unionist Federal Divisions stationed in Pennsylvania. Only a small number generals and upper commanders were captured, decapitating a couple units stationed in the state, but most did not go according to plan. Most federal units are still operational. With instruction from the Governor, Pittsburg Police and National Guard units seized federal buildings including the court house, administrative buildings, and field offices for the FBI, but they were retaken or repelled almost immediately.\n\nBy the end of the day, much of the state was not under our control. In the afternoon, Federal units received orders from New Orleans to consider Pennsylvania National Guard Units to be enemy troops. Because of the systematic failure of our operation, we can only assume that there was a leak. The CIA will be conducting a thorough investigation to find the source and if it was high up in the command chain.\n\nOur hope is that in the coming days, the National Guard will be able to hold key positions itself, and that they will be able to fight a guerilla war. We must decide whether to back them or let the operation become a complete failure."
nee_ge.32.a: "A day of days"

nee_ge.33.t: "Federal Troops Overwhelm Pennsylvania Guard Units"
nee_ge.33.d: "After the Pennsylvania National Gaurd failed to decapitate most of the Federal units stationed in Pennsylvania, National Guard troops began to be overwhelmed over the course of the week. While some regiments have fallen back to the hills in the north part of the state hoping to fight a desparate guerilla campaign, their causes seems hopeless."
nee_ge.33.a: "How could this happen?"

nee_ge.34.t: "The Question of Invasion"
nee_ge.34.d: "Following the failure of Operation Gray Eyes, it is clear to the entire world who was responsible. We have a choice to either take this failure for what it is and risk harming our international standing, or attempt to back up our intentions with action and provide support for the National Guard units still fighting Unionist tyranny."
nee_ge.34.a: "We must conceded defeat"
nee_ge.34.b: "Down with the traitors, up with the stars!"

nee_ge.35.t: "Operation Gray Eyes is Defeated"
nee_ge.35.d: "Following the failure of Operation Gray Eyes, New England has announced that they will not be supporting the remaining National Guard units still fighting Unionist Federal Troops. With New England not coming to save them, the National Guard units have surrendured to Federal forces and order is being restored. The FBI is doing a full and complete investigation of who was involved and is ensuring nothing like it can happen again."
nee_ge.35.a: "Those New Englanders always think they are so superior"

nee_ge.36.t: "Stalemate in Pennsylvania"
nee_ge.36.d: "Although Operation Gray Eyes has failed, New England has denied any involvement in it. Even though the American Union State certainly has proof of their involvement and can declare war, it has decided that they cannot afford to fight a war on 3 front at the moment and have decided to let New England save face."

# Leader descriptions #

POLITICS_RAYMOND_BALDWIN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nAugust 31st, 1893\nRye, New York, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nThe former governor of Connecticut, Raymond Baldwin was an unlikely victor in the 1945 New England presidential election. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was seen as a shoe-in to replace David Walsh as president, but when Kennedy was implicated in a bribery scandal, Baldwin was barely elected. With New York City not yet a state, the Republicans were able to squeek into the presidency on the back of Upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Baldwin's home state of Connecticut. Faced with a hostile congress, Baldwin's austerity economic policies are not popular. With the new states of New York City, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey added to the union, they tip the scales even further away from his reelection.\n\nRegardless, the economy is booming, and if he can harness it he may serve 8 years yet. Baldwin has had a relatively scandal free presidency, at least compared to his predecessor Walsh, and his former opponent Kennedy. Perhaps New Englanders will prefer a calm presence at the helm ."
POLITICS_AVERELL_HARRIMAN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember 15th, 1891\nNew York, New York, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nAlso known as "The Old Crocodile of Diplomacy", William Averell Harriman has spent his life working in diplomacy, government and business. After graduating top of his class in Yale, he would use his political connections and father's wealth to create his own Wall Street firm titled Brown Brothers Harriman and Company. At the beginning of the Second American Civil War, while his own hometown of New York City would join what would become the Combined Syndicates of America, Harriman left Wall Street and moved upstate to begin his political career.\n\nDuring New England's Intervention in the Second American Civil War, Harriman was appointed to one of the leading political roles in New England as the ambassador to Canada. After winning the Democratic primary, Harriman was easily able to win the Presidency from the Republicans. Now President, W. Averell Harriman is looking to revisit his democratic predecessor Walsh's social reforms and limit Canadian influence in New England. A jack-of-all-trades, Harriman is incredibly popular with the New States and is seen as a unifying figure in New England."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 28th, 18978\nNew York, New York, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nServing as the governor of New York, and later Upstate from 1933 to 1942 and most recently as a senator from the latter, Herbert Lehman has been called out of retirement to help the Democratic party recover from its devastating loss in 1949. Lehman is chief among the progressive wing of the Democrats and under his governorship, has pushed multiple reforms such as minimum wage and housing programs.\n\nAfter defeating his counterpart in the election, Lehman has pushed for a return to the ideas of the Second Square Deal and with Civil Rights being the hot issue in New England, Lehman is expected, if not obligated, to pass sweeping reforms to the treatment of minorities in New England. At age 75, most citizens did not expect Lehman to finish his campaign, let alone his presidency, yet defying expectations is something Herbery Lehman has done his entire life."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 24th, 1902\nOwosso, Michigan, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nBeginning his career as a federal prosecutor and eventually becoming the governor of Upstate New York, Thomas Dewey has become the second Republican president in New England. An outsider to the bustling cities of New England, Dewey has brought his small town values and philosophy to Beacon Hill. Although Dewey worked frequently with former President Baldwin during his governorship, he has a significantly more liberal outlook on the New England Presidency.\n\nOne of the most efficient governors in New England, Thomas Dewey is expected to implement his education and bureaucratic reforms in Upstate New York to the entirety of New England. Being the new face of the Republican Party, President Dewey has a difficult and divisive legacy to overcome. However, his past performances show that he is more than ready to lead."
POLITICS_JOHN_F_KENNEDY_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 29th, 1917\nBrookline, Massachusetts, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nWhen Joseph P. Kennedy's presidential campaign failed in 1945, most New Englanders believed they would never see another Kennedy in office, yet Senator John F. Kennedy has been sworn into office on Beacon Hill. At only 40, Kennedy has had an incredibly eventful life. Joining the New England Army in 1938, he would quickly rise in the officer ranks and would be awarded the New England Silver Star for his leadership in the Pennsylvanian Campaign. After his service, Kennedy was easily elected in his home state of Massachusetts due to his war hero status and father's connections.\n\NNow president, Kennedy is the first politician in New England to have served in the Second American Civil War and his experience there will no doubt shape his presidency. Kennedy has not only been a vocal supporter of civil rights in New England but also across the former United States. Kennedy may be the youngest president in New England and United States history, however, his service in combat and in politics displays his natural ability to lead."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJuly 8th, 1908\nBar Harbor, Maine, United States of America\n§W--------------§!\nGrandson to the wealthiest man in American History, former governor of Upstate New York Nelson Rockefeller has clinched the New England Presidency. Expected to work for his family's multiple enterprises, the Second American Civil War would leave Rockefeller and his family completely bankrupt. Through his family's political connections, Rockefeller was able to secure a bailout from the New England government to save most of his family's assets. Though the family's lucrative banking companies survived the war, Rockefeller would leave the family firm to begin a career in politics.\n\nRemaining non-partisan throughout his term in Upstate New York, Rockefeller has established himself as a practical problem solver as opposed to an entrenched ideologue. Taking a calm approach to the New England Presidency, Rockefeller has friends and enemies across congress and is planning on keeping the status quo. While Nelson Rockefeller's presidency has just begun, New Englanders can expect a calm leader during these troubling times."
