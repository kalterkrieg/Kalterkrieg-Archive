A different form of government entirely? With the failure of the Republicans in 1937, probably not... but can the people ever expect freedom and happiness?"

 ### Leader Descriptions ###

 POLITICS_PAVLO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 15th, 1873\nWiesbaden, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§LPavlo Skoropadsky was born into the Skoropadsky family of Ukrainian military leaders and statesmen, that distinguished themselves since the 17th century when Fedir Skoropadsky participated in the Battle of Zhovti Vody. In 1893 Skoropadsky graduated from the Page Corps and was assigned as a cornet to the Chevalier Guard regiment where he was put in charge of a squadron. After two years he was assigned a duty of the Regimental adjutant in the same regiment. In December 1897 he was promoted to Poruchik.\n\nSkoropadsky's first major assignment was a sotnia commander in the 2nd Chita Cossack Regiment of the Trans-Baikal Cossack Host in Chita during the Russo-Japanese War. Later he became an adjutant to the commander of the Russian forces on the Far East General Nikolay Linevich. During the Russo-Japanese war Skoropadsky was awarded the George's Weapon and several orders. In December 1905 Tsar Nikolai II made him a Fliegel-Adjutant in a rank of Colonel. By December 6, 1912 Skoropadsky had ascended to the rank of Major General of the H. I. M. Retinue.\n\nHis war record through the first Weltkrieg continued to be one of storied military competence. In October 1917 at the first Congress of the Free Cossacks he was awarded a title of the honorary Otaman.\n\nOn 29 April 1918, a coup d'état toppled the Ukrainian People's Republic and Skoropadsky became Hetman of Ukraine. The coup d'état had been sanctioned by the Imperial German Army, which in the spring of 1918 had occupied Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine. Since then despite attempts to the contrary, most notably in 1937 with the Republican movement, the Hetman has ruled Ukraine with Germany's blessing. After the Armistice was signed on the eastern front, he has ruled less of Ukraine than previously, but he still rules.\n\nBut Skoropadsky is now 74, and the natural question has arisen. What is the future of the Ukraine?"

 POLITICS_IVAN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 26th 1890\nSubotiv, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§LIvan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's life has been one of service first as a cossack and secondly to Ukraine. He has struggled for the recognition and statehood of the nation since the First Weltkrieg, and for a long time he served under the august Pavlo Skoropadsky with a sense of satisfaction and pleasure.\nNow however it has come that he must not serve, but lead. The tradition of Hetmanate will be preserved in Ukraine under his rule, and the dynastic ambitions of Danylo Skoropadsky will not come to pass. Much will be the same as it was in Ukraine it seems, perhaps even as it was before this latest experiment in democratic thought, despite the world continuing to plunge forward into the future."

 POLITICS_DANYLO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 13th 1904\nSaint-Petersburg, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§LDanylo Skoropadsky was born on January 31 (February 13), 1904 in St. Petersburg. He was named in honor of Hetman Daniel the Apostle.\nDanylo was the fourth child in the family of Pavlo and Oleksandra Skoropadsky, who at that time already had two daughters (Maria and Elizaveta) and a son Peter. Danylo's parents by their origin, wealth and position belonged to the highest aristocratic circles of St. Petersburg. A staunch constitutionalist, his inheritance of Ukraine may lead to some additional freedoms compared to those permitted by his father, an expanded democratic process and one that permits a more liberated national consciousness."

 POLITICS_HELMUTH_VON_PANNWITZ_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 14th 1898\nBotzanotwitz, Provinz Schlesien, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§LA member of the Prussian Minor Nobility, Helmuth von Pannwitz has been involved with the military since he joined a cadet school at the age of 12. By the age of 16 during the 1st Weltkrieg he was already a Leutnant. During the events of 1942 his conspicuous bravery lead him to become an Oberst. Having lived and fought on the Eastern Front amongst the Reichspakt's eastern allies, he was instrumental in liaising with Cossack forces, including helping the Danubians break the siege of Odesa.\nHis coordination with the Cossack troops under his command was such that they named him an 'Ataman', much to the distaste of Pavlo Skoropadsky. As a man who attends Orthodox services, it appears his appreciation for the Cossack way of life, and the Ukraine is sincere.\nThe question is, what will Ukraine look like under his leadership?"

 POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nApril 8th 1882\nVilna, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\n"

 POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 14th 1891\nZashkiv, Galicia-Lodomeria, Austria-Hungary\n§W--------------§!\n"

 krg_ukr.0.t: "Pavlo Skoropadsky Has Died"
 krg_ukr.0.d: "The Hetman was discovered in his palatial apartments today, having suffered a heart attack during the night. His doctor was called, but he was pronounced dead upon the doctor's arrival.\n\nNow the question is who will become the next Hetman - his son, Danylo, who he had groomed for the role, or his closest advisor, Ivan, who as Head of the Great Cossack Rada has a strong position to stake his claim."
 krg_ukr.0.a: "Now we see who comes out on top."

 krg_ukr.1.t: "Danylo Skoropadsky Crowned Hetman"
 krg_ukr.1.d: "After maneuvering and political chicanery, Danylo has been crowned Hetman.\n\nAs a strong believer in the role of the constitutional monarchy, it is hoped the Danylo will provide for more opportunities for the average Ukrainian. Some form of more democratic government may be in the future for the country, and the land will hopefully flourish under this experiment. There are of course, some questions about whether the Hetmanate will remain within the Skoropadsky family from now on, but there is no official remark on the matter just yet."
 krg_ukr.1.a: "Is this a monarchy now?"

 krg_ukr.2.t: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia Crowned Hetman"
 krg_ukr.2.d: "After maneuvering and political chicanery, Ivan has been crowned Hetman. \n\nA staunch believer in the classical cossack method of rule, it seems that for the time being, things will go on much as the same as they have in his predecessor's time. The Cossack traditions are ancient, and are arguably what freed Ukraine from the Tatar yoke. While that was a long time ago, a looming threat from the east still remains, and perhaps it is not so bad to be wary."
 krg_ukr.2.a: "The old ways are best"

 krg_ukr.3.t: "Danylo Skoropadsky Crowned Hetman"
 krg_ukr.3.d: "Pavlo Skoropadsky has died, and his son has managed to get to the crown of the Hetman.\n\nQuestions have arisen over what this means for the future of the Ukraine, but Danylo has already made overtures towards relaxing some of his father's stricter policies. It appears an expansion of the ongoing democratic experiment may be tested upon the rich soils of Ukraine."
 krg_ukr.3.a: "A constitutional monarchy?"

 krg_ukr.4.t: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia Crowned Hetman"
 krg_ukr.4.d: "Pavlo Skoropadsky has died, and his closest advisor has managed to get to the crown of the Hetman.\n\nQuestions have arisen over what this means for the future of the Ukraine, but Ivan has already ensured his power base by sending Danylo, Skoropadsky's son and his opponent in the election, into exile in Switzerland. It would appear that for the time being, things will be as they were."
 krg_ukr.4.a: "The Hetmanate maintains its ways. "

 krg_ukr.50.t: "Planning a Coup"
 krg_ukr.50.d: "Military attache to the Ukraine and representative of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Pannwitz has believes the new Hetman is to liberal and the more democratic path he intends will cause Ukriane to drift away from Germany. He needs support from the political elite and the German foreign office to successfully execute the coup."
 krg_ukr.50.a: "He receives full support."
 krg_ukr.50.b: "He is alone."

 krg_ukr.5.t: "A Coup!"
 krg_ukr.5.d: "Military attache to the Ukraine and representative of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Pannwitz today seized power in Ukraine in a lightning coup against Hetman Danylo Skoropadsky due to the reformist nature of his political policies.\n\nVon Pannwitz has stated his goals are to ensure the security of the German Eastern Flank and the military readiness of the Ukrainian people against the Russian threat. In the speech he gave over Radio Kiew to the nation, he stated that 'Western Liberalism is not something that Ukraine can afford, and is inimical to both German, and Ukrainian interests'"
 krg_ukr.5.a: "And so the Hetmanate ends."

 krg_ukr.6.t: "A Coup Attempt!"
 krg_ukr.6.d: "Military attache to the Ukraine and representative of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Pannwitz attempted to seize power in Ukraine in a failed coup against Hetman Danylo Skoropadsky due to the reformist nature of his political policies.\n\nHetman Danylo took to the airwaves on Radio Kiew and informed the nation of the treachery of von Pannwitz and that the Ukrainian government would get to the bottom of the matter. But it does not bode well for the relationship with Germany."
 krg_ukr.6.a: "Democracy flourishes in Black Soils."

 krg_ukr.7.t: "Helmuth von Pannwitz Seizes Power in Ukraine!"
 krg_ukr.7.d: "Military attache to the Ukraine and representative of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Pannwitz seized power in Ukraine in a lightning coup against Hetman Danylo Skoropadsky due to the reformist nature of his political policies being, in von Pannwitz's own words, \"inimical to German interests in the region.\"\n\nThere is no explicit report from Berlin as to whether this was a manoeuvre that was planned in the offices of the Auswartiges Amt, or a unilateral action on von Pannwitz's part. German divisions have however been sent to reinforce the coup government, and it seems for the time being the Hetmanate has been extinguished."
 krg_ukr.7.a: "Whither Ukraine?"

 krg_ukr.8.t: "Failed Coup d'état in Ukraine!"
 krg_ukr.8.d: "Military attache to the Ukraine and representative of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Pannwitz attempted to take power in Ukraine in a coup against Hetman Danylo Skoropadsky due to the reformist nature of his political policies being, in von Pannwitz's own words, \"inimical to German interests in the region.\"\n\nRelations between Germany and her client in Ukraine are now at a new low, with von Pannwitz held in the Hetman's Palace under armed guard, while the Auswartiges Amt attempts to make it clear that von Pannwitz worked alone and without official sanction."
 krg_ukr.8.a: "Whither Ukraine?"

 krg_ukr.9.t: "Long Awaited Elections Held!"
 krg_ukr.9.d: "After the reunification of the country and the ascent of Hetman Danylo, the day that Volodymyr Korostovets has been dreading has finally come to pass. No longer can it be delayed or dragged out, the regions have been organised, the voting commissions sent out and returned, and the people will be allowed to go to the polls, with the final count expected in about a week.\n\nThe Hetmanate has ordered that the elections be free and fair, and any found interfering with that will be most terribly punished!"
 krg_ukr.9.a: "URDP won the people's vote!"
 krg_ukr.9.b: "UNP takes the polls!"

 krg_ukr.10.t: "URDP win the elections!"
 krg_ukr.10.d: "The Ukrayins'ka radykal'no-demokratychna partiya (Ukrainian Radical Democrat Party) have won the elections, and Dmytro Doroshenko has been placed to the head of the Rada Verkhovna!"
 krg_ukr.10.a: "Liberalism triumphs!"

 krg_ukr.11.t: "UNP win the elections!"
 krg_ukr.11.d: "The Ukrayins'ka Narodna Partiya (Ukrainian National Party) have won the elections, and Yevhen Konovalets has been placed to the head of the Rada Verkhovna!"
 krg_ukr.11.a: "One nation, under the Hetman!"

 krg_ukr.12.t: "URDP win the Ukrainian election!"
 krg_ukr.12.d: "After the reunification of the country and the ascent of Hetman Danylo, the day that Volodymyr Korostovets has been dreading has finally come to pass. The Ukrayins'ka radykal'no-demokratychna partiya (Ukrainian Radical Democrat Party) have won the elections, and Dmytro Doroshenko has been placed to the head of the Rada Verkhovna, with Korostovets lame-duck premiership coming to an ignominious end after long outlasting it's welcome."

 krg_ukr.13.t: "UNP win the Ukrainian election!"
 krg_ukr.13.d: "After the reunification of the country and the ascent of Hetman Danylo, the day that Volodymyr Korostovets has been dreading has finally come to pass. The Ukrayins'ka Narodna Partiya (Ukrainian National Party) have won the elections, and Yevhen Konovalets has been placed to the head of the Rada Verkhovna, with Korostovets lame-duck premiership coming to an ignominious end after long outlasting it's welcome."
