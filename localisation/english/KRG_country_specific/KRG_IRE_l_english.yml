They largely support the \"temporary\" curtailing of political liberties to a degree in the name of \"national unity\", and greatly oppose socialism (especially after Collins' death).

### Leader Descriptions ###
IRE_richard_mulcahy_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 10th, 1886\nWaterford, Ireland\n§W--------------§!\nMulcahy's rise to presidency was expected, but the way was not. Having served together with Collins for many years, firstly during the war of independence working together to direct the campaign. He would then serve as Collins second in command for most of his political career being Príomh-Aire under Collins. So when the government went into exile after the Union of Britain's invasion and Collins remained to lead the resistance Mulcahy assumed the position of acting-President. After Collins execution by the syndicalist collaborators he became full president.\n\nBeing a staunch nationalist believing in a strong unified Ireland. Following in the tracks of Collins he has continued the centralisation of executive power."

krg_ire.1.t: "The Irish Republic, 1936-1948"
krg_ire.1.d: "Ireland has once again been occupied by the British, and once again we have triumphed over these occupiers. Every since Black Monday in 1936 Ireland has been on the precipice of destruction. With both domestic and foreign threats President Collins had to balance between authoritarianism and order, which all came tumbling down in 1941 when the Union of Britain invaded. Due to shortcomings in the Irish Republican Army the country fell to the syndicalist invaders. \n\nThe government would flee into exile in Portugal and later New England, except for Collins who would remain to lead the domestic resistance. He would meet his fate in 1943 when a group of syndicalist unionist militias bombed his headquarter. This event and other reports of Unionist collaboration led to the government in exile repealing the Ulster Privileges. The island would be liberated by the partisan movement funded by the German Empire and Entente landings." ## Temp?
krg_ire.1.a: "Free once again"

krg_ire.2.t: "The Irish Republic"
krg_ire.2.d: "Now Ireland stands at a crossroads. The economy is a mess after a slow recovery from Black Monday and occupation by the Union of Britain. Much of the economy must be reorganized after being seized and collectivized under the syndicalist collaboration government.\n\nThe political scene is fractured, with many growing discontented with Sinn Féin's continued rule. Mulcahy, who led the government in exile, still has much to prove and live up to Collins's legacy. The far-right has also grown strong after contributing significantly to the resistance efforts.\n\nLastly, Northern Ireland has grown discontented with the repeal of the Ulster Privileges." #placeholder
krg_ire.2.a: "Can we survive the new future?"

krg_ire.3.t: "The Birmingham Trials" # Irish perspective
krg_ire.3.d: "The United Kingdom has started its trials of the syndicalist war criminals. Having been occupied by the Union of Britain, we have partly assisted and are hoping for the extradition of William Joyce. Joyce, who led the occupation, is facing a death sentence, and the public wants his head."
krg_ire.3.a: "Joyce shall be brought to justice" #placeholder

krg_ire.4.t: "The British Trial of William Joyce" # Irish perspective
krg_ire.4.d: "As the Irish nation further recovers from its five long years of occupation under the Maximist jackboot, across the Irish Sea, the British conclude their trial of the notorious William Joyce. As the leader of the occupational Irish Socialist Republic, he was the mastermind behind the persecution and execution of tens of thousands of Irish nationalists-\n\nWith Joyce convicted on all charges brought forward by the British courts, some say that the man has met a deserved fate. Most, however, despise the idea of the English deciding the fate of a man who thoroughly scarred the Irish country and her people, even if their ruling coincides with ours. As such, our diplomats have approached the British with an extradition request so we may try him properly, and the heinous acts perpetrated by him and the Saor Éire government may finally be addressed by our judicial system." 
krg_ire.4.a: "We await their response…"

krg_ire.5.t: "Britain Extradites Joyce"
krg_ire.5.d: "Great news arrives in Dublin today as the British government accepts to extradite William Joyce back to Ireland. Arriving in a troop transport today at Dublin Airport, the plane was met by two platoons of the 3rd Infantry Battalion, where he was subsequently disembarked and escorted to Portlaoise Prison, where he awaits his trial. Already, many in Ireland are joyous to hear of his extradition, and Mulcahy has sent a personal thank you to the British Prime Minister for allowing the extradition. With this development, the Supreme Court, in conjunction with the High Court, has already begun the judicial process of which to sentence Joyce and bring justice to those who suffered and died under the occupational government." 
krg_ire.5.a: "Now, to assemble a jury…"

krg_ire.6.t: "The Trial and Execution of William Joyce"
krg_ire.6.d: "After three weeks of testimonies, both from the prosecution and defense, the Supreme Court of Ireland has found William Joyce guilty on all presented counts, which include crimes against peace, conspiracy, and war crimes. Joyce had remained unfazed by the charges brought against him, even seeming unrepentant when the court had sentenced him to death. Once the trial had concluded, his execution took place in Mountjoy Prison, where it was reported his last words before being hanged were “I am proud to die for the Maximist cause and I am sorry for the workers who have died breaking their chains.”  Already, celebrations have taken place across Ireland at the news of his death, as many finally receive closure on the loss of their loved ones under the Syndicalist occupational government." 
krg_ire.6.a: "Good riddance."

krg_ire.7.t: "Britain Refuses to Extradite Joyce"
krg_ire.7.d: "The British government has refused to extradite William Joyce, citing fears of suicide and logistical issues. Instead, he will be executed in Britain. A trial in absentia is being organized." #placeholder
krg_ire.7.a: "His judgment must be heard" 

krg_ire.8.t: "The Trial in Absentia of William Joyce"
krg_ire.8.d: "After three weeks of testimonies from both the prosecution and the defense, the Supreme Court of Ireland has found William Joyce guilty on all counts presented, which include crimes against peace, conspiracy, and war crimes. Joyce, still being held in the United Kingdom, would only learn of the news through a newspaper. Joyce will be executed in the United Kingdom together with the rest of the war criminals."
krg_ire.8.a: "If only we could see his face"

krg_ire.1000.t: "Thanks for Playing"
krg_ire.1000.d: "This is the end of the proper content for Ireland. As Ireland isn't a major, it hasn't received as much content. The plan is to add this later on when I get time.\n\nYou can look forward to an expanded Troubles which will now change after the election. There will be different content for the different paths. Sinn Féin will try to modernize their authoritarian tendencies. Saorstát Críostúil will have some issues with health and might be forced to adjust their ideas. Fine Gael will need to balance their coalition and will receive pushback from more conservative factions. And Ailtirí na hAiséirghe will try to reform Ireland in their way while trying not to implode.\n\nFrom here, Ireland only has basic skeleton content. The Troubles will just continue as it has. Again, thanks for playing; this was my first project, so I hope you enjoyed it - Axolotl"
krg_ire.1000.a: "Thank you"

krg_ire_elections.1.t: "Election Season Begins"
krg_ire_elections.1.d: "With the winter of 1952 beginning to thaw, all eyes are on the elections in 6 months time. These are likely to be the most contentious yet with Sinn Féin's grip on power slowly receding. Éamon de Valera's Saorstát Críostúil (Christian Republic) and Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin's Ailtirí na hAiséirghe (Architects of the Resurrection) have both began to grow among an increasingly SF weary populace still reeling from the horrors of the occupation. Sean MacBride's Fine Gael, while small, seems to be gaining immense momentum among the younger generations though its vague and mildly pro-Accordist policy has shown to alienate older generations. Regardless this will be an election for the ages and could see the end of Sinn Féin dominance."
krg_ire_elections.1.a: "Strap in lads..."

krg_ire_elections.2.t: "Sinn Féin Campaign In Dublin"
krg_ire_elections.2.d: "Today, speaking from Dublin Castle, current president Richard Mulcahy spoke towards a crowd of Sinn Féin supporters with a fairly good turnout despite poor weather. Mulcahy took the oppurtunity to decry 'political extremism' in the form of radical ultranationalism and socialism before talking of the horrors of the Occupation and invoked the memory of President Collins.\n\nAfter much cheering and jubilance, Mulcahy revealed the Sinn Féin manifesto and declared that if elected Sinn Féin would destroy those who threatened the Republic at home and abroad along with continuing the current Sinn Féin course, an action that will no doubt lead to more of the authoritarian status quo."
krg_ire_elections.2.a: "Good luck Mulcahy."

krg_ire_elections.3.t: "Saorstát Críostúil Publishes Manifesto"
krg_ire_elections.3.d: "In a move that has surprised few, today Saorstát Críostúil president, Éamon de Valera published the party's manifesto for the 1952 election. Effectively a reproduction of prior manifestos it emphasises a need to move away from Sinn Féin's authoritarian secularism and 'reconnect' with the Church. De Valera's party has managed to slowly grow its support base as poor workers turn to the firmly Christian SC and its left-wing tendencies over the deeply stained Labour party.\n\nFinishing his speech, de Valera declared that he would expect 'all good Irishmen' to make the 'moral' choice in the elections and promised to wage a campaign of 'social justice' should he win."
krg_ire_elections.3.a: "A stale opening from a stale man."

krg_ire_elections.4.t: "Sean MacBride Announces Anti-SF Pact"
krg_ire_elections.4.d: "Today in Galway, Fine Gael and Labour announced plans to establish an 'Anti-Sinn Féin pact', with Sean MacBride and William Norton taking questions from the press. MacBride took the lead and declared that Sinn Féin's slow erosion of civil liberties would inevitably see dictatorship. While not a coalition in the traditional sense, both parties have agreed not to stand competing candidates in an area where one is likely to win and have encouraged their voters to support the anti-SF candidate in the area. While the pact only consists of Fine Gael and Labour, both Clann na Talmhan and the NDP have shown a willingness to cooperate with it."
krg_ire_elections.4.a: "Tactical voting? Now where have I seen this before..."

krg_ire_elections.5.t: "ANH Members Breakup Socialist Meetings"
krg_ire_elections.5.d: "A massive brawl has broken out in Dublin after members of the radically nationalist and Russian inspired ANH broke up a Republican Congress meeting by force. Both sides armed with clubs, truncheons, pipes and other blunt weapons spilled out into huge street violence before the Gardaí broke things up. Party leader Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin has weakly condemned the violence though publicly stated that 'apologists for the Occupation deserve nothing less' and declared that unless Sinn Féin is to get a handle on 'rampant leftism' then the ANH would have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe violence has no doubt raised Ó Cuinneagáin's profile but for now they only remain a small grouping with a slim chance of seats in the Dáil. Should he get the chance, Mulcahy would obliterate them like Collins and the National Guard"
krg_ire_elections.5.a: "Didn't we chuck Ó Cuinneagáin in prison?"

krg_ire_elections.6.t: "Jim Larkin Jr. Murdered"
krg_ire_elections.6.d: "Scandalous news has erupted in Belfast as the body of radical socialist and IWL president, Jim Larkin Jr., has been found shot to death in a back alleyway. With sectarian violence still rife in the North, gunshots and screams in the night are not uncommon and often go unreported. With no leads, suspects, or witnesses and any tangible evidence washed away in last night's storm, the Ulster Gardaí will no doubt put this investigation in the cold cases soon enough.\n\nWith Larkin Jr's death reaching the news, Roddy Connolly has taken the reigns of the IWL and denounced the government for not conducting a more thorough investigation. While still living, Larkin Jr had amassed a large list of enemies acoss the entire political spectrum and conspiracies have already began to swirl."
krg_ire_elections.6.a: "A scandal that will ring out across the Ireland."

krg_ire_elections.7.t: "Fine Gael Looks For Allies"
krg_ire_elections.7.d: "In a smoke filled backroom above some sordid old café in Galway, Fine Gael representatives met with members of Clann na Talmhan to discuss the possibility of CnT inclusion in the Anti-SF pack. Clann na Talmhan's agrarian policies have taken a more pro-business and pro-large farm slant under Joseph Blowick, not to at odds with Fine Gael. Of course, their demands of inclusion in any Fine Gael government could be too much of a compromise for the young party. By the end of the night..."
krg_ire_elections.7.a: "...a deal was struck."
krg_ire_elections.7.b: "...the talks go nowhere."

krg_ire_elections.8.t: "Fine Gael Surges In Polls"
krg_ire_elections.8.d: "In a shock election twist, Sinn Féin splinter Fine Gael has began to surge ahead in the polls after the recent announcement of increased participation in the Anti-SF Pact. As Fine Gael finds its momentum bolstered by the day, its leadership have warned against complacency and the party's campaign apparatus has motored into overdrive to capitalise on the boost."
krg_ire_elections.8.a: "Could they become a dark horse?"

krg_ire_elections.9.t: "Anti-SF Pact Dissolves"
krg_ire_elections.9.d: "In a shock election twist, the Anti-SF Pact has been declared dead after inter-partisan squabbles. Today, William Norton declared in Dublin that Labour would be withdrawing any support for Fine Gael in the coming election and will instead seek to run on its own platform, hinting that a potential alliance with Clann na Talmhan was not out of the picture. With no allies and its first gambit failing, Fine Gael has found its momentum collapsing alongside the ANH which has found some of its support bleed to more moderate parties."

After a mild applause Mulcahy made clear that Sinn Féin now seeks to align on the world stage and that 'by riding on the shoulders of giants, Ireland will ride out the next war.'

But after years of chipping away at Sinn Féin's vote and solidifying its support base, Saorstát Críostúil has done what was once deemed impossible and toppled the Sinn Féin regime. In his first speech to the Dáil as president, de Valera outlined his intention to lead a 'moral government' and that the authoritarian Collins Constitution will soon be relegated to the dustbin of history.

While the ANH has achieved a plurality, the presidential election still lacks a clear winner.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Kevin O'Higgins has secured a blank cheque from the German Ambassador, Eduard Hempel, and Minister for Justice Seán Mac Eoin has begun contacting his friends in the Army.

The MP's have suggested light autonomy in the form of a regional Parliament and additional safeguards to protect the rights, religion, and properties of Anglo-Irish citizens. Most MP's are in favor of certifying the Six Counties as Irish possessions and rescinding land claims as a territory of the United Kingdom. It has been suggested to &get.name to use the idea as a negotiation tactic to secure Anglo-Irish rights, security, and autonomy as part of the final negotiation."
krg_uls_con.4.d_soft_con: "The Commission on Ulster has released its final negotiation guidelines. MP's advise that in order to safeguard the rights and privileges of the Anglo-Irish, Ulster should enjoy a significant amount of autonomy, including its own regional Parliament, judiciary, and constabulary with all requisite police powers. While the territory would be considered Irish, it would have its own functional internal systems aligned closer to the legislative and administrative framework as currently exists within Northern Ireland. This would establish a system formally known as "One Government, Two Systems," and allow Northern Ireland to maintain its own bureaucratic apparatus while permitting the flourishing of both north and south."

Given the compelling desire to protect the security and community of Northern Ireland, the MP's on the Commission propose that Ulster be given a high degree of autonomy, including its own independent Parliament, judiciary, and police force.

This deadlock has led to a series of debates within the Dail on what path to take forward on the matter with three major plans being proposed and approved by members of the Dail, the first of these options is supported by many Diehard nationalists and IRA supporters is that of simply ending these talks once and for all we have fought them for eight hundred years and will fight them for eight hundred more. The second of these plans is to offer additional concessions to the British government to perhaps give up on this foolish autonomy, the final plan is to double down upon the previous offer as a final offer for the British.

This has caused shock among many MPs and the general public who are appalled that not only the Irish would end the negotiations and not establish the Anglo-Irish Friendship Society and Cultural Commission to ensure protections for the local population of Ulster. This has also caused discontent in the opposition who have decried us for failure to ensure autonomy in Ulster and caused certain Warhawks in Parliament to proclaim a need for direct military intervention.

The Irish diplomats have come up with a new solution that alongside the creation of the  Anglo-Irish Friendship Society the Irish government will offer us various economic concessions, that would not only vastly aid in the economic recovery of Britain but also make it more difficult for Ireland to act against us in the growing conflict with the Germans."

krg_ire_focuses.1.d: "With Ireland on the road to economic recovery, it’s only natural that the famous Guiness Brewery resumes operations in the Saint James’s Gate Brewery. The famous beer had been synonymous with the Emerald Isle since its founding in 1759, steadily increasing its export and production until the declaration of war by the UOB, where it had to shut its doors due to the harsh rationing of the occupational government and subsequent liberation. \n\nNow, as Germany and Ireland grow closer together, the company has announced the construction of a new brewery in the German Empire. While the Empire has its fair share of local and national breweries, many young adults preferred the imported dry stout over domestic offerings, with many enjoying the smooth malt taste and notes of roasted barley. This expansion into continental Europe marks the second brewery constructed by the company, and one of the first foreign owned breweries to be certified of its compliance with the ‘Reinheitsgebot’ laws, dictating the regulation of ingredients in German lagers and ales. \n\nAs many workers continue to reconstruct the country, the resumption of Guinness beer production and its export has become a big morale boost not only for the Irish people, but also for their beer-loving friends on the continent."

Originally composed of Truck and Link roads, which had connected major Irish cities since the 1920’s, this system had been functioning well during the early years of Irish independence. However, with more of our citizens buying automobiles, along with poor maintenance from the Syndicalist occupational forces, these roads have shown their age. \n\nAs such, it was announced by Richard Mulcahy that Ireland would reform the road networks along the German Autobahn model. Dubbed the Federal Motorway Act, it would see massive investments into new highways and roads that would connect our cities in a more efficient manner, along with providing much needed work for those that are still unemployed. While German advisors and Irish engineers pour over maps of the old road networks, construction crews have already broken ground just outside of Dublin in what will become the new M-1 Motorway, which would connect the capital to Belfast. In the meantime, however, the Act has allowed for more resources to be allocated to repairing and maintaining our existing roads."

As part of the initiative to both extend the power grid into rural areas and to expand our power generation, the Ardnacrusha Power Plant is currently seeing an immense overhaul. \n\nHeavily damaged during the retreat south by Syndicalist forces, the external structure has been recently rebuilt, while any components within the dam have been either overhauled or scheduled for replacement with newer parts. However, a notable difference from the pre-war dam are the four new German-made Kaplan turbines, which are projected to generate around 100 megawatts of electricity once they are fully installed. This upgrade to the power plant, coupled with the reopening of the Poulaphouca Reservoir power station on the River Liffey, should allow for Ireland's power demand to be comfortably met and sustained with the growing demand on our electrical grid once they resume full time operations."

krg_ire_news.1.d: "News from Ireland has hit the international press, that incumbent president, Richard Mulcahy, has retained his position in government and won a second term for the presidency despite fears of a loss due to the increasingly unpopular Collins Constitution. At a press conference with foreign journalists, Mulcahy emphasised that while Ireland will always commit to peace it can no longer sit idly by and must 'choose its friends' lest it face another occupation akin to the 1941 British invasion.\n\nFor now, Sinn Féin's policy manifesto is more or less the maintenance of the authoritarian Collins Constitution, market liberalisation and continuing Ireland's slow reconstruction. For Ireland itself, Mulcahy's victory represents a continuation of the status quo for Ireland, certain ascendancy to the Reichspakt and coming into the crossfire of its ever expanding list of enemies in the coming Kalterkrieg."

De Valera has been jockeying for the position since the 1934 election. He has since managed to endure successive defeats and slowly chip away at the Sinn Féin vote. At a press conference with foreign journalists, de Valera declared that under his stewardship Ireland will 'stand aloof from the petty squabblings of dying and oversized empires' and will no doubt sever international trade ties.\n\nUnder de Valera Ireland will certainly begin to wind down the unpopular Collins constitution and become a fiercely catholic nation once more. By shying away from foreign conflicts, Ireland will no doubt manage to ride out the incoming Kalterkrieg, should it not be threatened by British aggression once more."

Ó Cuinneagáin's path to power has not been an easy one with the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe only taking a miniscule majority in the Dáil but not securing the presidency itself. With President Mulcahy fleeing abroad, an extraordinary vote in the Dáil saw Ó Cuinneagáin elected to the position via tiny majority.\n\nIn his first speech to foreign journalists, Ó Cuinneagáin made clear his intentions to 'purify' Ireland and institute a cultural revival.

Mulcahy's gambit has not proven paticularly popular and it is believed that riots have already flared up throughout the country though any news from the island is sketchy and unconfirmed.\n\nIn a leaked telegraph correspondence between Mulcahy and the British government, it has been established the Irish military has seized key points and all major cities across the island with martial law declared and known ANH members being rounded up, their fates unknown.

Calling the elections a sham, the protesters claim that the new electoral boundaries were designed to favour Catholic candidates at the expense of the Ulster Democratic Party. Protesters are calling for the reinstatement of the Ulster privileges and an end to the discrimination against protestants.\n\nThe crowds numbered in the hundreds, while some protesters held signs that read \"No justice, no peace\" others chanted slogans demanding fair elections and the return of the Ulster privileges. Basil Brook leader of the UDP was in attendance and held a short speech talking about the mistreatment displayed in the election.\n\nThe situation remained tense, but peaceful, as police officers monitored the protesters and attempted to maintain order. There were no reports of violence or arrests, but tensions continue to simmer in Northern Ireland as the aftermath of the local elections plays out."

Stones and other objects were being thrown when a shot rang out. The violence began spreading to the adjacent neighborhood of Belmont and quickly spread to the rest of the city\n\nIt continued for the next few days spreading to all of Northern Ireland. The Garda would attempt to quell the violence but has had issues with officers participating in violence. Tensions already at boiling point burst.

### Ideas ###
IRE_collins_laws: "The Collins Laws"
IRE_collins_laws_desc: "Under the constitution, the president shares executive power with the Príomh-Aire; though, due to laws and legal precedents established under Collins, the president has become the sole executive. This was part of Collins' policy to transform Ireland's government along the lines of the United States. Collins' goal was a true presidential republic; however, his critics claimed he was creating an elective absolute monarchy."
IRE_anti_socialism: "Galvanized Anti-Socialism"
IRE_anti_socialism_desc: "Ever since the beginning of the Occupation, and the assassination of Michael Collins in 1943 by Northern Irish syndicalists, the Irish people have been highly anti-socialist. The various parties in the Dáil might disagree on many things, but they share a common truth: Socialism and Syndicalism threatened to tear our young nation apart, and they must never again rise to prominence. "
IRE_ulster_question: "The Ulster Question"
IRE_ulster_question_desc: "We've exercised control over Ulster ever since 1926, however there has since been trouble. Populated by a majority Anglo population, most citizens in the region support Basil Brooke's Ulster Democratic Party. More concerningly, the King never renounced their claim on Ulster after the revolution claimed their nation.\n\nThis might not have been a problem previously, but now the United Kingdom has been restored. They may, at any time, wish to assert their claim over Ulster, something militant unionists are desperately trying to encourage. The dialogue we've had with London seems to suggest they are likely to formally drop their claim in the future, but we must be prepared for all eventualities. The uncertainty of the Ulster Question looms over us, and it must be answered as soon as possible."
IRE_anglo_irish_treaty: "The Anglo-Irish Treaty"
IRE_anglo_irish_treaty_desc: "Signed in 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty created an independent Irish nation, the Irish Free State. It was a controversial treaty, but one that ended the brutal struggle that the Irish people had endured during the Weltkrieg. Despite vast constitutional changes since, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was never fully nullified after the British Revolution, and its existence gave the Union of Britain a casus belli to invade the Emerald Isle.\n\nAs part of the negotiations that led to the liberation of Ireland, elements of the Anglo-Irish Treaty were reaffirmed by Ottawa. Though the main governmental clauses were abandoned, the main clauses reinforced pertain to the Treaty Ports. To facilitate the invasion of the Home Islands, control of three ports were ceded over to Canada, where they remain today. This arrangement, though important in ensuring our independence post-liberation, is rather unpopular. Establishing a new dialogue with Canada is key if we want to negotiate an end to the Treaty."
