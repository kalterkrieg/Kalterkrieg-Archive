krg_mly.0.t: "The National Convention"
krg_mly.0.d: "While the Japanese have been providing protection for the various states of Malaya, as well as directly administering the former Straits settlements, there has been a growing upswell of social discontent.\n\nEven in the halls of power, the popular sense is that if Japan considers Malaya a part of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, it must be on a basis that has Malaya lead by Malayans, or it is nothing but a sham perpetuated just as it was done by the German and British 'advisors' beforehand.\n\nThus a National Convention has been called and all politically interested parties are heading to Kuala Lumpur in order to hammer out a proposal and shape our future."
krg_mly.0.a: "We will resolve the questions!"

krg_mly.1.t: "The Nationality Question"
krg_mly.1.d: "Malaya is by it's nature a state of many contrasts and has been settled by many peoples over the years. The Indians and Chinese communities have been there for centuries, and there are still Europeans from the colonial era and now the Japanese are also here.\n\nThe question is whether then, we should seek a multiethnic state with each grouping represented in some way, be it reserved parliamentary seats and the like... or should the Malay people, who have been shoved to the back by these incomers, finally get their chance to shine, by enshrining their rights and protections in the state that bears their name?"
krg_mly.1.a: "Malaya for the Malays!"
krg_mly.1.b: "A multiethnic Malaya!"

krg_mly.2.t: "Organising the States"
krg_mly.2.d: "Historically Malaya has never been unified until the age of Colonialism, and even then, the people of Malaya were administered in separate states, some federated, others unfederated and the Straits settlements were also held apart.\n\nWe should choose a configuration that will support the national interest of all Malayans, whether it be a Unitary state, a Federation along the current lines, or even a looser confederation with no strong oversight."
krg_mly.2.a: "A Federation will be most efficient"
krg_mly.2.b: "A Confederation will serve us well"
krg_mly.2.c: "Only by Centralising Power will we survive"

krg_mly.3.t: "The Head of State"
krg_mly.3.d: "The history of Malaya has been that for a very long time, we have had the Sultans of various territories and settlements ruling parts of the Pennisula. They are still entitled to their rule in some respects as they saw which way the wind was blowing when the Colonial powers gained an interest in the region, and pragmatically signed treaties of protection rather than fighting to the death. Some thus say we should remain a monarchical society, with a rotating system of leadership in the position of Head of State.\n\nOthers say that Monarchy is an institution that is leaving the world, and we should instead elect a President from the masses, who will have more merit by the fact he has fought to his position, as opposed to being born to the role."
krg_mly.3.a: "A rotary system suits us."
krg_mly.3.b: "We will elect a President!"

krg_mly.4.t: "A constitutional monarchy?"
krg_mly.4.d: "If we are to have our head of state be one of the four Sultans of the Malay States, on a rotating basis, we should ensure that their rule has some boundaries. We would not desire them to perhaps think they are able to rule without regard for the people, or one another.\n\nThus it is proposed we will cement a Constitutional Monarchy in the Nation."
krg_mly.4.a: "Naturally."

krg_mly.5.t: "An empowered executive?"
krg_mly.5.d: "While we have set up the rotary system, we should ensure that the head of state is not merely a figurehead but someone able to take an active role in the affairs of state. If we are tapping this talent, we should allow them to exercise their prerogative somewhat, no?"
krg_mly.5.a: "The Ruler's Voice is Important!"

krg_mly.6.t: "Lèse Majesté Laws"
krg_mly.6.d: "The national discussion must remain civil and well mannered when on the topic of the Sultans. It is only natural that such a restriction is placed on our society, if we are to be led by these people, we should not speak ill of them."
krg_mly.6.a: "A fair price, surely."

krg_mly.7.t: "Finalising the Constitution"
krg_mly.7.d: "After much back and forth, we have something that we can call a Constitutional Document for a future Malay State. We can finalise this, and present it to the Japanese as the basis for their handover of the nation."
krg_mly.7.a: "Now we will hold the 1949 Durbar!"
krg_mly.7.b: "Now to select a president."

krg_mly.8.t: "The 1949 Durbar"
krg_mly.8.d: "Placeholder: Pick a sultan, any sultan, he'll do!"
krg_mly.8.a: "The only thing remaining is elections!"

krg_mly.9.t: "The 1950 Elections"
krg_mly.9.d: "Placeholder: People get to vote and someone wins, hurrah!"
krg_mly.9.a: "PRM victory!"
krg_mly.9.b: "PPP victory!"
krg_mly.9.c: "UMNO-PPP coalition!"
krg_mly.9.v: "Alliance victory!"
krg_mly.9.e: "UMNO victory!"

krg_mly.10.t: "Handover to Elected Government in Malaya" #Japan
krg_mly.10.d: "Placeholder: The Malays have written a constitution, decided how they want to run their country, and held elections. We should let them get on with it, right?"
krg_mly.10.a: "Direct Military Control is unneeded!"
krg_mly.10.b: "Actually, we had plans for Malaya!"

krg_mly.11.t: "A President rules a... Republic?"
krg_mly.11.d: "Placeholder: If we're electing presidents, we're probably going to be a Republic rather than having the Sultans around, right?"
krg_mly.11.a: "Right"

krg_mly.12.t: "But who leads?"
krg_mly.12.d: "Placeholder: Do we want a strong presidential system, or a parliament with a president as head of state functionary only"
krg_mly.12.a: "Parliamentary System!"
krg_mly.12.b: "Presidential System!"

krg_mly.13.t: "Picking a Provisional President"
krg_mly.13.d: "Placeholder: Who is going to get the honor of being the father of the nation?"
krg_mly.13.a: "That guy! Placeholder!"

krg_mly_news.0.t: "Japanese Handover of Malaya"
krg_mly_news.0.d: "Reports are coming in that after recent elections held in the former Japanese Protectorate of Malaya, the territory has now been officially released from direct rule by the Imperial Japanese Army under General Imamura Hitoshi, and has instead come into an era of democratically elected leadership under [MLY.GetLeader].\n\nThis news is certainly surprising to some observers, who believed the Japanese intended on direct military rule in the region for an indefinite period. \n\nWhile some reports are saying that little has changed on the ground, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] seems like it may be marked on Malayan calendars for many years to come, and the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere seems to be delivering on it's promises of Asia for the Asians."
krg_mly_news.0.a: "Hmm, intriguing"

krg_mly_news.1.t: "Abortive Handover of Malaya leads to unrest"
krg_mly_news.1.d: "Reports are coming in that after recent elections held in the former Japanese Protectorate of Malaya, the territory has fallen into unrest after the Imperial Japanese Army under General Imamura Hitoshi refused to relinquish control to the newly elected authorities. \n\nThis news is unsurprising to some observers, who believed the Japanese intended on direct military rule in the region for an indefinite period, but other commentators are stating it may be the beginning of new issues in South East Asia for the Japanese. \n\nWhile some reports are saying that little has changed on the ground, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] seems like it may be marked on Malayan calendars for many years to come, as a date when the people decided to rise up and fight the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere which was unable to deliver on it's promises of Asia for the Asians."
krg_mly_news.1.a: "Asia for the Japanese perhaps."
