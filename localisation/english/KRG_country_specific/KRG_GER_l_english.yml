GER_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "Bund der Kommunisten \n§LThe §ABund der Kommunisten§! (League of Communists) was formed out of the Hamburg tendency of the §RKAPD§!. By and large, they are an almost destroyed organisation, rooted out by the wartime government following the Rhenish occupation. Its remaining members are intensely radical and totalist in ideology, so much so that they've lost the support of the syndicalist §RKAPD§!.§!"

GER_radical_socialist_party_long: "Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\n§LThe §RKommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands§! (Communist Workers' Party of Germany) was established in 1920 from the left faction of the §tKPD§!, itself a left-wing faction of the former §tUSPD§!, and had grown to become the primary far-left party in Germany, though that all changed during the Second Weltkrieg. Empowered in the Rhineland, the §RKAPD§! had to preside over a brutal war economy to maintain their position. Today, with the Rheinische Kommunenbund long gone, the §RKAPD§! have collapsed into near-irrelevance. Their remaining members have attempted to move back to the peaceful revolution position of the Berlin Tendency, which has put them in open conflict with the §ABdK§!.§!"

GER_social_democrat_party_long: "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LThe §SSozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands§!

Decisively shut out of power with the appointment and subsequent success Reichskanzler Schleicher had in leading Germany through the aftermath of Black Monday. Eventually, the §SSPD's§! policies towards the Third Internationale, the rejection of a second Burgfrieden, directly caused the occupation of the Rhineland, and after pro-Schleicherist members formed the §tDNAP§! the §SSPD§! has been barred from government. Today, they remain the largest opposition to the centralising dictatorship. The §SSPD§! stands for classical social-democratic values, as well as a complete pivot of German foreign policy, as such they oppose the Kalter Krieg as a whole. Ever since Hans Vogel's death in 1945, they've been led by Carlo Mierendorff."

A competition between the §ZModerates§! under Heinrich Brüning, and the §gRightists§! under Franz von Papen. In the end, continued electoral losses under von Papen allowed the Moderates to regain their power, and under Brüning the §ZZentrum§! has seen a resurgence. The §BBayerische Volkspartei§! (Bavarian Peoples Party) was returned back to the fold, and they've reached popularity levels unseen since their heyday at the turn of the century.

With the liberal March Constitution and the rise of the §rDVLP§!, the future of the §gDkP§! saw an all time low, but now they have since recovered under Schleicher's wartime government. The aftermath of Red Brunswick saw Kuno von Westarp jettisoned as party chairman, being succeeded by Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. After the §gDRP§! collapsed, many of her former members joined the §gDkP§! as a more moderate, pragmatic faction, led by Robert Lehr. They're avowed monarchists, nationalist conservatives, and economic interventionists. Many of them are also pretty non-committal on the stance of democracy, and if the §lDNEF§! experiment succeeds many, but not all §gDkP§! politicians and voters will form the new political base.§!"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party: "DNEF" #Schleicheristischeverein
GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Deutsche Nationale Einheitsfront\n§LThe §lDeutsche Nationale Einheitsfront§! (German National Unity Front) is not a political party in the traditional sense, but rather a political experiment by Ferdinand von Bredow to essentially redraw German Politics. Combining a broad united front of conservative & anti-democrat military and civilian officials, the §lDNEF§!'s ultimate aim is the 'Zentralisierung' of Germany; to supplant the traditional, multi-party Prussian Constitutional system and replace it with an efficient, centralised dictatorship acting in the 'imperial interest above partisan politics'. Nationally conservative, monarchist and statist, their overarching ideology is directly informed by the Reichskanzler, and by a lesser extent the Kaiser himself. As such they can be somewhat ideologically fluid, but always absolutist in nature. The §lDNEF§! enjoys the direct support of the Kaiser, and many of the most politically influential groups in the Empire. It can be likened to a modern incarnation of the Weltkrieg era §rDVLP§!, though with völkisch elements sidelined.§!"
GER_national_populist_party: "DVLP"
GER_national_populist_party_long: "Deutsche Vaterlandspartei\n§LThe §rDeutsche Vaterlandspartei§! (German Fatherland Party), formed in 1917 and was intended as a catch-all movement unifying the entire German political class to achieve victory in the Weltkrieg. However, following a split in the §rDVLP§! between Alfred Hugenberg and Heinrich Claß, the radical anti-government §rDVFP§! was formed. Overall today the §rDVLP§! stands for similar policies as they did in the interwar era, ultra-nationalism and anti-semitism. However, their continued existence is pretty much purely to ensure the far right is pro-government, as Heinrich Claß is deeply involved with the Bredow administration. As such, if the §lDNEF§! centralises power the §rDVLP§! will join up with them pretty simply, as a 'Volkisch Faction'.§!"

GER_the_enabling_act: "The Ermächtigungsgesetz"
GER_the_enabling_act_desc: "In early 1937, facing the inefficiencies of democracy, the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) was pushed through the Reichstag by Kurt von Schleicher's minority government. The Act affords our government the authority, while the nation lies in a state of national emergency, to pass laws without the consent of the Reichstag and Bundesrat, which has suspended democracy in the Kaiserreich effectively indefinitely. As a compromise to get it enshrined in law, any acts that directly concern the Bundesrat and Reichstag must still go through the traditional channels, which protects the de-jure sovereignty of them. The executive powers from the Enabling Act only increased after 1945 when Ferdinand von Bredow succeeded von Schleicher after his death.\n\nNow, with the war legally over, though the 'national emergency' still legally ongoing, a decision must be made. Reichskanzler Ferdinand von Bredow, together with a large clique of militarists and anti-democratic conservatives, are making plans for a great 'Zentralisierung' (Centralising) of the government, cementing the currently de-facto dictatorship while permanently neutering the Reichstag and Bundesrat. Such an act will require the consent of the aforementioned institutions, and few will happily vote for the permanent dissolution of democracy, so such plans are muted for now. Meanwhile, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler of the DkP leads a collection of more-moderate politicians in arguing for a return to the tried-and-tested system of Prussian Constitutionalism. This would end the Ermächtigungsgesetz and the powerful position it gives us, but they argue the old system is a more stable option long term.\n\nWhatever happens in the future, currently the Ermächtigungsgesetz gives us supreme control over Germany, and we must take advantage."

The Entente claim that the Heimdallr detonation was unplanned and unnecessary, and has only increased the suffering of the British people. In addition, our nuclear weapons make the rest of the world very uneasy, leaving us diplomatically challenged.

GER_centralisation_cat: "Building the 'Neuer Staat'"
GER_centralisation_cat_desc: "The proposition of the New State, a centralised, authoritarian and importantly stable Germany, is not a new one but it is now the blueprint for our grand reforms. The Germany of old was an inefficent, outdated husk of an empire, saddled with an archaic constitution that enshrined the mistakes of liberalism, and even accepted the spectre of socialism. The Germany of old was almost crushed by these mistakes, and we will work tirelessly to fix them. With the Reichskanzler and Kaiser working side by side, it will only be a matter of time until the Kaiserreich is once again the great nation she is supposed to be!\n\n§YCurrent Progress through the Neuer Staat Reforms:§!

GER_amend_the_imperial_press_law_desc: "Enacted in 1941, the Kriegszeit Presseregelungsgesetz (Wartime Press Regulation Act) helped regulate the news of the Empire, silencing dissidents and morale high during our darkest hour. As part of Reichskanzler Bredow's reforms, we will use our executive authority to amend the Act, allowing it to remain intact during peacetime as a preventative measure against anti-imperial media."

GER_bundesrat_reform: "Trial the Krosigkplan"
GER_bundesrat_reform_desc: "Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, an experienced adminisrator, has submitted a series of reforms concerning the Bundesrat, hoping to streamline the system by reducing redundancies and the overly-complex, Wilhelmine-era bueruacracy while also increasing the DNEF's involvement with their decision making. Though we can't yet formally enshrine them into law, owing to limitations with the Enabling Act, we should at least trial his ideas to see if they work. If they do, then the mainly conservative Bundesrat is almost certain to support the Zentralisierung."

GER_fund_the_DNAP_desc: "Lothar Erdmann's fledgling DNAP was set up with Kurt von Schleicher's backing, but it has survived the Chief's death, consolidating itself as a right-wing worker's party, a moderate alternative to the SPD. If we divert some government funding towards the DNAP's coffers, we might be able to pull more support away from the SPD and into more amenable avenues."

GER_encourage_liberal_splinters_desc: "Liberals in Germany have historically always been rather divided, with left-liberals opposing national-liberals in various different flavours. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, these liberal camps have consolidated into the socialist-supporting LVP and the irrelevant conservative WP, neither of which are reliable allies for our cause. By working with pro-government liberals, we can hopefully create a 'Liberal-Conservative' third party that will support us into the future."

GER_enabling_act_timer: "Expiration of the Enabling Act"
GER_enabling_act_timer_desc: "The Ermächtigungsgesetz is due to expire in March 1950, and another extension of it seems near-impossible owing to the divided, almost hostile state of the Reichstag, in addition to its requirement of being at war. If we are unable to complete our grand reforms before the Act expires, then we'll be stuck unable to pass any new laws; the 'New State' will never be realised!"

GER_centralisation_negotiation_cat: "The 'Zentralisierungsakt' Negotiations"
GER_centralisation_negotiation_cat_desc: "If we want to pass the Reichszentralisierungsakt (Imperial Centralisation Act) and finalise the New State, the terms of the Enabling Act specify that we'll need a majority in the divided Reichstag to do so. As the National Unity Front doesnt have a direct political base in the Reichstag, we'll need to negotiate with the various parties present from the 1936 Reichstagwahl and garner their support for our great and noble cause.\n\n§YThese Decisions will affect the Reichstag Support variables in the 'Building the Neuer Staat' section.§!"

GER_negotiate_with_the_DNAP: "Negotiate with the §PDNAP§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_DNAP_desc: "The DNAP, one of Schleicher's many political projects, generally supports the government, representing the growing-conservative working class constituents of the Empire. Getting them onside should be simple, but they'll likely have a demand in return."
GER_negotiate_with_the_NLP: "Negotiate with the §IStresemannites§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_NLP_desc: "The Big-Tent Liberals are champions of the middle class and maintain a 'reasonable Realpolitik of the centre'. However, they hold connections to monopolist industrialists; several West German bankers and industry magnates, whom would do well under the Neuer Staat. Lets remined them of who they are beholden too."
GER_negotiate_with_the_Zentrum_Federalists: "Negotiate with the §ZZentrum Moderates§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_Zentrum_Federalists_desc: "Heinrich Brüning's centrist 'Moderates' control the Zentrum, and though principled, Brüning has shown interest in the Neuer Staat in the past. Getting them onside will be a big boon to our cause, so lets remind Brüning of his alliegences."
GER_negotiate_with_the_Zentrum_Rightists: "Negotiate with the §gZentrum Rightists!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_Zentrum_Rightists_desc: "Franz von Papen can be considered one of the chief supporters of the Neuer Staat, and controlling the right-wing of the Zentrum he'd be a worthy ally. That said, Papen likes a 'fair trade', so expect a counter-offer if we're to get his support."
GER_negotiate_with_the_BVP: "Negotiate with the §CBavarian People's Party§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_BVP_desc: "The Bavarian People's Party is often bound lock-step with the centrist Moderate elements of the Zentrum. That said, by appealing to their regionalist tendencies (however annoying it may be), they'll be more interested to support the Neuer Staat."
GER_negotiate_with_the_PP: "Negotiate with the §RPolish Party§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_PP_desc: "The Polish Party is one of conservatives, often connected to the Zentrum in debates and voting. That said, they should be easy to get to support us, though it may take some investments into their core lands."
GER_negotiate_with_the_Independent_Conservatives: "Negotiate with the §gMinor Liberals§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_Independent_Conservatives_desc: "The National Liberals have long been the party of 'Big Business', a group of professionals who largely support the National Unity Front. By appealing to their nationalism and supporters, they should fall in line."
GER_negotiate_with_the_Agrarians: "Negotiate with the §GAgrarians§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_Agrarians_desc: "Germany has a whole host of Agrarian parties, usually divided by region, but united in their support of right-wing, protectionist agrarian policies. If we throw them a farming-based bone, they will almost certainly bite."
GER_negotiate_with_the_Minority_Parties: "Negotiate with the §YRegionalists§!"
GER_negotiate_with_the_Minority_Parties_desc: "There are regionalist parties dotted across the Empire, a remnant of the Zentrum's implosion in the early 30's. They are weak but proud, and as such may drive a hard bargin if we are to get their support."

GER_goerdelerplan_cat: "The Goerdelerplan"
GER_goerdelerplan_cat_desc: "Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler has been appointed Reichskanzler of the German Empire, and now moderates control the nation once again. However, simply being in power isn't enough. Goerdeler is an opponent of Radicalism on all fronts, and he has a plan to restore the Kaiserriech to her former glory.\n\nThe 'Goerdelerplan' as its affectionately known is a sweeping series of reforms to restore and modernise the political systems that existed before von Bredow took his shot at brutalising them. Our aim isn't revolution however, and the plan will not destabilise the nation any further. To this end, the Goerdeler Cabinet has been empowered to undertake any reforms necessary to stabilise and strengthen the Prussian system."

GER_restore_the_1920_constitution: "Restore the March Constitution"
GER_restore_the_1920_constitution_desc: "The 1920 Constitution isn't perfect by any means. In fact, much of it is severely outdated by modern standards. That said, it's better than what the DNEF would put in its place."
GER_reassert_the_landtags: "Reassert the Landtags"
GER_reassert_the_landtags_desc: "Thanks to Schleicher and Bredow, the Landtags of the German Empire have had all of their legislative power transferred to the central government. This cannot stand any longer. The Landtags must have their legal authority restored."
GER_bundesrat_expansion: "Reform the Bundesrat"
GER_bundesrat_expansion_desc: ""
GER_lift_anti_socialist_laws: "Lift Anti-Socialist Laws"
GER_lift_anti_socialist_laws_desc: "Bredow's fear of socialism led to the unlawful imprisonment of hundreds of good God-fearing citizens. The Red Menance is no more. It's time for us to move on."
GER_implement_anti_socialist_laws: "Reinforce Anti-Socialist Laws"
GER_implement_anti_socialist_laws_desc: "The only commendable stance that the DNEF held was on socialists. Let us continue to remind these parasites that they are not welcome in Germany."
GER_abolish_the_three_class_system: "Abolish the Three-Class Voting System"
GER_abolish_the_three_class_system_desc: "The Three-Class Voting System is an archaic remnant of a bygone age and has no place in a modern democracy. Universal male suffrage is the only reasonable path forward."

### New State Tree ###
GER_press_censorship: "Reichspressereform"
GER_press_censorship_desc: "Despite what the democracies of the world would have us believe, freedom of the press is not a deterrent against tyranny. In fact, it is very much the opposite. It is a conduit by which nefarious malcontents can poison the minds of law abiding citizens against their leaders. We must be able to restrict the circulation of such harmful material. They may groan and complain about it now but the people will thank us in time."
GER_veteran_benefits: "Veteranenhilfegesetz"
GER_veteran_benefits_desc: "The courage and tenacity by which our veterans fought for the empire is unmatched. We owe these heroes a tremendous debt, a debt that we will begin to repay immediately. A multi-partisan bill that would provide far-reaching assistance for veterans has reached the floor of the Reichstag. Its adoption would create a new Reich ministry whereby eligible veterans can receive healthcare services, disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, and more. The bill is immensely popular with the public so its passage through the Reichstag shouldn't be of any concern."
GER_honour_our_heroes: "Honour Our Heroes"
GER_honour_our_heroes_desc: ""
GER_continue_demobilisation: "Continue Demobilising the Economy"
GER_continue_demobilisation_desc: "For the last seven years every part of the German economy, no matter how small or seemingly unrelated, was dedicated to one purpose; total war. Tanks, planes, and artillery were made in the tens of thousands while only a handful of facilities were left to produce the bare essentials needed by the civilian population. Our economic advisors have informed us of the need to transition back to a civilian economy as soon as possible. Demand for consumer goods has increased dramatically since the end of the war was announced and if we do not act fast we run the risk of the economy collapsing."
GER_expand_the_victory_column: "Expand the Siegessäule"
GER_expand_the_victory_column_desc: "Initially designed to commemorate Prussia's victory in the Second Schleswig War, the Siegessäule has meant different things to different generations. During the worst years of the Zerstörung, Berliners took comfort in seeing the Roman goddess Victoria standing in defiance of the Internationale's bombing raids. The Golden Lady, as she was called, became an important rallying symbol for the nation. We would do well to capitalize on this fact by expanding the Siegessäule into something far grander and worthy of the patriotism that it inspires in our people."
GER_aftermath_of_koln: "Aftermath of the Köln Riots"
GER_aftermath_of_koln_desc: "The Köln Crisis, an event that threatened to tear the empire apart, has passed. With rioters returning to their homes and factories reopening, it appears that a lasting calm has finally fallen upon the Rhineland. It should be safe for us to pursue other matters of importance now that the crisis has been resolved."
GER_politicise_militarists: "Politicise the Militarists"
GER_politicise_militarists_desc: "The threat of the Köln Crisis spiraling into a widespread revolution convinced the Kaiser to appoint Generalfeldmarschall Eberhard von Mackensen to the office of Reichskanzler. With the famed "Subjugator of Britain" as head of government, the military will surely support any measure that one of their own deems necessary. An Army with a State at last."
GER_maintain_wartime_spending: "Maintain Military Spending"
GER_maintain_wartime_spending_desc: "A strong nation needs a strong army. We are not simply a strong nation. We are the greatest nation and the greatest nation requires the greatest military in the world. Why, in the name of all that is holy, would we cut back on defense spending now?"
GER_arm_the_police: "Empower the Federal Police"
GER_arm_the_police_desc: "It's not enough that we simply expand the Verpo. For the Neuer Staat to succeed, an extensive expansion of the Bundespolizei is also needed. In addition to receiving more funding and personnel, the Bundespolizei will have a number of legal "roadblocks" removed so that they can conduct their duties more quickly and efficiently. Crime will become a thing of the past in no time!"
GER_form_a_military_industrial_complex: "Expanding our Militärindustriekomplex"
GER_form_a_military_industrial_complex_desc: "The Reich's enemies are everywhere. They hungrily look upon our nation with hatred and envy in their hearts. Every effort must be made to ensure Germany's victory in this "cold war". Arrange a meeting with our friends in the arms industry. They're about to receive an offer they can't refuse."
GER_bureaucratic_overhaul: "A Grand Bureaucratic Overhaul"
GER_bueraucratic_overhaul_desc: "Imperial bureaucracy, much like the empire as a whole, is outdated and inefficient. A dramatic overhaul of the system is needed to ensure that the Neur Staat can function properly once it has been implemented. We cannot let a bunch of fat, lazy, old men stand in the way of progress."
GER_break_up_democrats: "Split the 'Demokratische Union'"
GER_break_up_democrats_desc: "The Democratic Union has been a thorn in our side for long enough. They will never willingly support the Neuer Staat and will surely block any attempt we make to bring it about. This coalition of weak minded fools must be broken up at all costs."
GER_expand_verpo: "Verdeckte Reichspolizei Expansion"
GER_expand_verpo_desc: "The Imperial Secret Police served with distinction during the war. Many would be terrorists were caught thanks to its efforts. The exigencies of the Neuer Staat call for a massive expansion of the organization as threats to the kaiser are just as numerous within the country as they are on the outside."
GER_politicise_the_intelligence_services: "Politicise the Intelligence Services"
GER_politicise_the_intelligence_services_desc: "Fearing that unrest may spread to workers in other major cities, the Kaiser has appointed Johannes Popitz to the office of Reichskanzler. Retaining his previous post as Minister of Economics, Popitz now has the chance to guide the nation's recovery as he sees fit. He will no doubt seek to gather support for his reforms from friends he has made in the intelligence services."
GER_introduce_corporatist_reforms: "Begin the Popitzplan"
GER_introduce_corporatist_reforms_desc: "In a bid to further consolidate control over the Empire, Reichskanzler Johannes Popitz has instituted the aptly named 'Popitzplan'. This personal project will place large sections of the economy under direct government control. Concessions will be given to the nation's major companies to ensure their loyalty and cement our power over the means of production."

GER_gather_support_for_centralisation: "Gather Support for the 'Zentralisierung'"
GER_gather_support_for_centralisation_desc: "The Zentralisierungsakt is as necessary as it is controversial. The other parties will never support its passage unless they are granted significant concessions in exchange. For the betterment of the Reich, it must be passed. It is the only way we can guarantee that our children and grandchildren have a future that isn't defined by servitude and weakness. Deutschland Über Alles."
GER_the_centralisation_act: "The Zentralisierungsakt"
GER_the_centralisation_act_desc: "The Zentralisierungsakt will surely be the most important piece of legislation ever passed in Germany. Its enshrinement will ensure that the Reich is never crippled by weak leadership and liberal infighting ever again. All power will now reside with the Kaiser and his appointed Reichskanzler. A brighter, safer future now dawns for the Vaterland."

### Goerdeler Tree ###
GER_grand_coalition: "Die Große Koalition"
GER_grand_coalition_desc: "The stranglehold that the Einheitsfront has held on German politics is no more. A grand coalition of conservatives and right-leaning centrists under the leadership of Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler will lead the nation from now on. The restoration of German democracy starts here!"
GER_reconstitute_verpo: "Reconstitute the Verpo"
GER_reconstitute_verpo_desc: "The fact of the matter is that the average German has never had any reason to fear the Verpo. Many of the laws that they were meant to enforce, such as the ban on non-sanctioned radio broadcasts, were openly ignored by everyone from the common baker to Bredow himself. The organization has never employed more than 30,000 personnel in total, hardly enough to monitor the activities of 80 million people. Its organizational structure was always better suited to investigative purposes over law enforcement anyways. We should reorganize the Verpo along these lines."
GER_a_conservative_approach: "Adhere to Conservatism"
GER_a_conservative_approach_desc: "Many would say that Germany is synonymous with conservatism. The empire and its constituent states were founded on such principles and our adherence to them has served us well so far. Let's not "rock the boat", as the Americans say, and deviate from what works."
GER_lean_to_reformism: "Leaning to Reformism"
GER_lean_to_reformism_desc: "Contrary to what many outsiders believe, we Germans are perfectly capable of recognizing the faults in our own society. Most are fully aware that the winds of reform will make their way to the Reich sooner or later. It is better that we begin following the current now then continue to struggle against it."
GER_dismantle_dne: "Dismantle the Einheitsfront"
GER_dismantle_dne_desc: "The Unity Front represents a clear and present threat to German democracy. Its dissolution must be thorough and complete lest any remnant be allowed to reform and try its diabolical schemes again. The very freedom of the German people depends on it."
GER_restore_constitution: "Restoring the Constitution"
GER_restore_constitution_desc: "The 1920 Constitution is not perfect. Far from it in fact. Many aspects of it are incredibly outdated by today's standards. All things being equal, it has kept the empire together over the years and is a vast improvement over what Bredow and his sycophants hoped to replace it with. Its restoration should hopefully afford us the opportunity to modify it to better fit the times."
GER_reverse_bredow_oppression: "Reverse Bredow's Oppression"
GER_reverse_bredow_oppression_desc: "Ferdinand von Bredow was many things, chiefly a power hungry, paranoid, old fool. His oppression of the citizenry was as immoral as it was illegal. Our lawyers are working tirelessly to remove his corrupting influence from the nation's legal system. No loyal citizen should live in fear of persecution from their own government."
GER_anti_socialist_agenda: "Continue the Anti-Socialist Agenda"
GER_anti_socialist_agenda_desc: "The only respectable position Bredow had was his intolerance of socialism. Oh they claim to be working for the betterment of all but most are nothing more than wolves in sheep's clothing. Syndicalists in disguise waiting for the right moment to strike. The German people must continue to be reminded of the danger they represent."
GER_embrace_voting_reform: "Embrace Voting Reform?"
GER_embrace_voting_reform_desc: ""
GER_negotiate_with_dne_supporters: "Take In the Bredowists"
GER_negotiate_with_dne_supporters_desc: "Bredow's followers still make up a sizable portion of the government. If we are to ensure that our work is successful then it is imperative that we convince as many of them to work with us as possible. Failing to bring them into the fold will just lead to the Einheitsfront inevitable reformation under a different name."
GER_for_kaiser_and_country: "Für Gott, Kaiser und Vaterland"
GER_for_kaiser_and_country_desc: "Despite what some right-wing hardliners would have the people believe, we are not radical anti-establishment hooligans hellbent on destroying the Reich and overthrowing the Kaiser. We are just as proud of our imperial heritage and traditions as they are and we have never entertained the idea of abolishing any of the German monarchies. The only difference between us is that we believe in the principles of a strong monarchy that is backed by an equally strong constitution. We are patriots and will gladly fight for what has made Germany the greatest nation on Earth!"

### 1951 Election ###
GER_1951_election: "1951 Reichstagwahl"
GER_1951_election_desc: "The 1951 Reichstag Elections, the first such elections to take place in the post-war period, have now begun. While numerous parties are expected to participate, all eyes lay on the two parties most likely to form a government, Zentrum and DkP."
GER_DKP_victory: "DkP Victory"
GER_DKP_victory_desc: "The German Conservative Party has secured a majority in the 1951 Reichstagwahl and has formed a government with the Kaiser's approval. The DkP government is expected to focus most of its attention on socioeconomic issues and matters of defense."
GER_zentrum_victory: "Zentrum Victory"
GER_zentrum_victory_desc: "Zentrum has managed to secure a majority in the Reichstag and has formed a government with the Kaiser's approval. The Catholic dominated party is expected to guide the nation through its interpretation of modern democratic ideals and traditional Christian values."
GER_female_sufferage: "Female Suffrage"
GER_female_sufferage_desc: "The issue of female suffrage has been a hotly contested one for the last few decades. Most of the developed world has already given women the right to vote and hold public office. Contrary to what the conservative establishment thinks, our refusal to do the same makes us look primitive and backwards. Women are as every bit as capable of shaping Germany's future as men are and it's well past time that we formalize this fact in law."

GER_expand_the_reichsautobahn_desc: "In addition to repairing wartime damage, the Reichsautobahn is in desperate need of expanding. Traffic has increased dramatically as automobiles have become less expensive and more readily available. Autobahns in the eastern half of Germany are also not as developed in comparison to the rest of the country."
GER_form_the_national_christian_union: "Form the National Christian Union"
GER_form_the_national_christian_union_desc: "Trade unions are not inherently evil. Man on the other hand, is a born sinner. An interesting proposal that seeks to rectify these two issues has reached the Reichstag. If passed, the proposal would see the establishment of a national level trade union that is specifically designed to adhere to Biblical values of work and fellowship. Catholic and Protestant churches would be invited to host meetings wherein the nation's workers could make petitions and resolve grievances in a friendly and supportive environment. In theory, this system should assuage anyone from pursuing the dark paths of socialism."
GER_national_railway_company: "National Railway Company"
GER_national_railway_company_desc: "Public means of transit should not be owned by private corporations. Many railway companies are already charging commuters unreasonably high rates in the name of greater profit margins.

GER_invest_in_the_future_desc: "German universities have long been the envy of the world. Indeed, more and more students flock to our country each year to seek higher education. It would be foolish of us not to capitalize on this fact by making it easier for our citizens to access our many fine institutions. We will suffer no "brain drain" here!"

### Reconstruction ###
GER_begin_the_reconstruction: "Begin the Reconstruction"
GER_begin_the_reconstruction_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg, the deadliest and most destructive conflict in human history, is finally over. Millions of dead, countless cities reduced to rubble, a nation brought to the brink of collapse. This is the Germany that exists today; the aftermath of a hardfought and bittersweet victory. But now is not the time for us to dwell on what we have lost for the arduous task of reconstruction now falls upon us. The sooner we start, the sooner we can start again."
GER_recon_resume_the_sozialwohnungsbauprogramm: "Resume the Sozialwohnungsbauprogramm"
GER_recon_resume_the_sozualwohnungsbauprogramm_desc: "Prior to the outbreak of the war, the SPD government had initiated a fairly ambitious social housing program for the nation's poor and homeless. Originally intended for victims of Black Monday, the program's scope was greatly expanded when large numbers of Americans began arriving in the country as a result of their civil war. With the war finally over, it has been suggested that we resume this program to help the millions of refugees that fled to the relative safety of Central Germany."
GER_ruckkehrprogramm: "Rückkehrprogramm"
GER_ruckkehrprogramm_desc: "Millions of civilians fled the syndicalist onslaught that fell upon the Rhineland in the first years of the war. The brutal nature by which the region was taken, occupied, and later defended by the Red French means that there is little for Rhinelanders to return to. The Reich Reconstruction Authority has come up with a series of plans to assist these displaced peoples in returning to the region. The Rückkehrprogramm will employ these poor souls in rebuilding Rhenish parks, schools, and hospitals. The money they make will be kept in a special account where after a set period of time it can be withdrawn, left to accrue interest, or be used as payment for a year's rent of a new model home in the suburbs. If successful, this program will both repopulate the Rhineland and jumpstart its economy."
GER_modellstadt: "Modellstadt Essen"
GER_modellstadt_desc: "The Ruhr city of Essen is a unique case for the Reich Reconstruction Office. The city was home to the longest battle of the war which left a trail of devastation the likes of which had never been seen. Less than 3% of Essen's pre-war population remained when the city was finally liberated in 1944. An ambitious group of engineers have convinced the leadership of the Reconstruction Office to use what remains of Essen as a test bed for a new approach to city building. A city whose infrastructure can easily be expanded as it grows in size and population. If done properly, they argue that Essen can be used as the model by which other heavily destroyed cities are rebuilt upon."
GER_complete_reconstruction: "Complete Reconstruction"
GER_complete_reconstruction_desc: "The latest report from the Reich Reconstruction Authority has revealed the following:\n\n"The work of a million builders, carpenters, and engineers is close to bearing its last bushels of fruit. Aside from one or two long term projects, reconstruction is expected to be completed within the next six weeks. Our workforce deserves all the praise in the world for what it has accomplished, finishing the Wiederaufbau several months ahead of schedule. Soon, our great nation will be ready to assert itself on the world stage. Gott mit uns!""
GER_new_industrial_towns: "New Industrial Towns"
GER_new_industrial_towns_desc: "Some city planners have argued that reconstruction efforts would be better spent on expanding cities that escaped the war relatively unscathed. While such a move would certainly be unpopular among the citizens of hard-hit cities like Frankfurt and Dusseldorf, the proposal does have some merit. Why patch over bullet holes when we can start fresh elsewhere instead?"
GER_urban_revitalization: "Urban Revitalization"
GER_urban_revitalization_desc: "Eastern Germany has had little in the way of urban development over the past few decades. In truth, metropolitan investments have almost always been focused on the Central and Western parts of the Reich. A number of advisors to the Reconstruction Office have suggested that it may be more efficient to invest in pre-existing urban areas in Posen and Silesia then it would be to start from scratch elsewhere."
GER_soldiers_to_workers: "Soldiers to Workers"
GER_soldiers_to_workers_desc: "14.6 million soldiers held the line against the forces that sought the Reich's destruction. With our borders secure for the foreseeable future, the demobilization and repatriation of our boys can begin. Returning soldiers will be placed in government organized work companies to aid in rebuilding the nation, trading their rifles and machine guns for picks and shovels.This gradual transition to civilian life should prevent the unrest that jobless veterans brought with them at the end of the previous weltkrieg."
GER_brick_by_brick: "Brick by Brick"
GER_brick_by_brick_desc: "No region of the Reich suffered more during the Second Weltkrieg than the Rhineland. Occupied by the Red French in 1940, the region was administered by a puppet regime that called itself the Rheinische Kommunenbund. These Marx-loving traitors helped transfer dozens of the Rhineland's most productive factories to Commundard France where they were reassembled and put to work against us. The reestablishment of these factories back to their proper place is an important, albeit, time-consuming venture. We will not let the memories of the Kommunenbund taint the legacy of the Reich's industrial heartland anymore."
GER_industrial_subsidies: "Industrial Subsidies"
GER_industrial_subsidies_desc: "While reconstruction is progressing well enough, some economic experts are calling on the government to subsidize businesses working in the steel and logging industries. Doing so should, in theory, help boost the economy as more jobs are created in these critical fields of work. An increased supply of much needed building materials should also help speed up rebuilding efforts."
GER_tax_breaks: "Tax Breaks"
GER_tax_breaks_desc: "The necessities of war required us to raise taxes by a significant amount in order to keep the nation running. With peace finally achieved we no longer have a valid reason to maintain our current level of taxation. With that said, any adjustment to taxes will need to be passed through the Reichstag before it can go into effect. The Reichskanzler would do well to make sure he has enough support before changing something that has undoubtedly made many of his colleagues in the legislature quite wealthy."
GER_extensive_research_grants: "Extensive Research Grants"
GER_extensive_research_grants_desc: "Kronprinz Wilhelm, a man with a keen interest in all things technological, has requested that a sizable portion of the government's reconstruction budget go to the nation's technical and scientific institutions. He argues that innovations in science and engineering will not only help the nation rebuild more quickly but also give it a technological edge over its enemies. His argument does hold water. It's only a matter of time until the other major players in world politics obtain guided missiles, jet aircraft, and even more troubling, atomic bombs. Surely there's enough leftover funds to accommodate our future kaiser's sensible request."
GER_cooperation_with_krupp: "Cooperation with Krupp"
GER_cooperation_with_krupp_desc: "Krupp, a name synonymous with quality arms, has struggled to find its footing in the post-war world. A number of its factories have already closed their doors as demands for new equipment have dropped sharply since demobilization finished earlier in the year. Companies like Krupp will always be needed though as the defense of the Reich is an everlasting responsibility. Let us subsidize a handful of their factories to help keep them afloat. You never know when you'll need a few million rounds of artillery."
GER_the_second_ruhr_boom: "The Second Ruhr Boom"
GER_the_second_ruhr_boom_desc: "Speedy reconstruction in combination with smart investing has led to what experts are calling the Second Ruhr Boom. Like the one before it, this new boom is transforming the greater Rhine-Ruhr region through vast urbanization and industrial development. At its current rate of growth, the Ruhr is expected to easily outpace pre-war production many times over. Now is the best time to approach our friends in the Danubian Federation about bringing our two empires closer together through a great canal that will link the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea."
GER_bridge_east_west: "Bridging the East-West Gap"
GER_bridge_east_west_desc: "Railway connections between Central and Eastern Germany have historically been much weaker than they should have been. This fact was made abundantly clear when the Russians stormed across the Oststaaten in 1941. It will be forever argued that we could have prevented, or at least significantly delayed, the fall of Belarus and the United Baltic Duchy had our troops been able to reach the frontlines sooner. This cannot be allowed to happen again especially now that deposits of valuable resources are being found in Posen and Silesia. Eastern Germany must be just as connected as the rest of the country."
GER_bayer_and_basf: "Bayer and BASF"
GER_bayer_and_basf_desc: "If it wasn't for the damned Japanese we'd still have all the rubber and oil we would need to meet consumer demand at home. The loss of our Pacific colonies and the failures of the Mittelafrikan Administration to pick up the slack leaves us little choice but to seek alternative solutions. Germany is home to the best chemical companies in the world; Bayer and BASF are giants in their field. By heavily funding their research into synthetic materials, we may be able to reduce our dependence on foreign oil."
GER_hydrocarbon_exploration: "Diversify Oil Sources"
GER_hydrocarbon_exploration_desc: "Synthetic oil is all well and good but the technology needed to produce it in large enough quantities still eludes us. As such, we have directed the Auswärtiges Amt to reach out to the world's major oil producing countries. With any luck, we'll be able to reach a favorable trade agreement with one of them and secure our fuel needs for the foreseeable future."
GER_silesian_epicenter: "The Silesian Epicenter"
GER_silesian_epicenter_desc: "Silesia has been an integral part of the Kingdom of Prussia ever since Frederick the Great wrestled control of it from Maria Theresa in the middle of the 18th century. A region rich with natural resources, mining businesses and regional planners believe it has the potential of becoming an industrial powerhouse on par with the Rhineland. Coal in particular looks as though it will be the primary driver of growth as geologists believe that Silesia is home to one of the largest coal basins in the world. We would be foolish not to seize an opportunity like this."
GER_wintershall_ag: "Support Wintershall"
GER_wintershall_ag_desc: "Wintershall has been the nation's largest crude oil and natural gas producer since the 1930's. As such it is imperative that we ensure they are able to operate as efficiently as possible. Subsidizing their operations and granting them access to potential sources of oil at home will help us achieve a greater level of autarky in the future."
GER_friedrich_krupp_germaniawerft: "Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft"
GER_friedrich_krupp_germaniawerft_desc: "The venerable Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft has been the primary builder of the Imperial Navy's warships since the 1890's. Its shipyards in Kiel have no equal in the world. A sizable grant is being offered for the construction of new shipbuilding facilities in the area to better fulfill OKM's modernization program."

GER_dealing_with_the_dreadnought: "Dealing with the Dreadnought"
GER_dealing_with_the_dreadnought_desc: "To say that the Navy's preoccupation with dreadnoughts in the years leading up to the Second Weltkrieg was a mistake would be an understatement. Our large slow-moving vessels proved to be easy targets for enemy naval bombers especially in our fight with the Japanese. A fact that the "Carrier Clique" says could have been avoided had we spent the same amount of time developing our own naval aviation capabilities as we did on our battleships. The "U-Boat Clique", in turn, states that the prioritization of submarine production would have allowed us to starve our enemies into submission. Whatever the case may be, something must be done to ensure that the High Seas Fleet can tackle anything that the Canadians may throw at it in the future."
GER_the_next_generation_kaiserliche_marine: "The Next Generation Kaiserliche Marine"
GER_the_next_generation_kaiserliche_marine_desc: "A major hindrance to the Imperial Navy's success in the Second Weltkrieg was the hamstrung command structure that was forced upon it by Wilhelm II. The late kaiser was obsessed with having direct control over "his ships" and this obsession manifested itself into the Admiralstab, an organization that was answerable only to him. This backwards form of command had been established in the years leading up to the First Weltkrieg and persisted throughout the second. After much convincing, our new kaiser has begrudgingly agreed to transfer control of the navy back to its proper place. The reformed Oberkommano der Marine will do a great deal in transforming into a modern fighting force."
GER_repair_wilhelmshaven: "Repair Wilhelmshaven"
GER_repair_wilhelmshaven_desc: "The great shipyards of Wilhelmshaven were sabotaged by our own forces once the order to abandon the city to the French was given in mid-1942. They remain largely in the same ruined state we left them when we reclaimed the city two years later. Wilhelmshaven must be rebuilt into the great shipbuilding city it once was before our plans for naval expansion can begin in earnest."
GER_beneath_the_waves: "Beneath the Waves"
GER_beneath_the_waves_desc: "Admiral Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière and his "U-Boat Clique" have convinced OKM that the future of naval warfare lies, not above the waves, but beneath them. Perière's plan is to heavily invest in the designing and construction of a vast fleet of advanced U-boats. Why spend large sums on big slow moving carriers when we can just as easily replace any subs we may lose to the enemy?"
GER_above_the_seas: "Above the Seas"
GER_above_the_seas_desc: "OKM has laid out the necessary plans needed to turn the High Seas Fleet into a modern naval force. Carriers shall take the place of outdated battleships and dreadnoughts as the focal point of our fleets. This drastic change in our approach to naval warfare will take time to set in. Presently, a new curriculum for the cadets of the Imperial Naval Academy at Mürwik is being written so that future graduates will have the knowledge necessary to lead our ships to victory."
GER_a_silent_stalker: "A Silent Stalker"
GER_a_silent_stalker_desc: "The Type XXI Elekroboot, while not used in great numbers due to a series of unforeseen complications, is the future of U-Boot design. Up until now, submarines have had to spend the majority of their time acting as surface ships, only submerging for brief periods to avoid detection. New advancements in diesel–electric transmission will make this issue a thing of the past. Blohm & Voss has been contracted to create the first class in this new generation of U-Boots, the Type XXVI."
GER_naval_rocketry: "Naval Rocketry"
GER_naval_rocketry_desc: "Tested extensively throughout the later stages of the war, naval rocketry demonstrated its worth during the amphibious landings in Britain and Crimea. While originally placed onto converted landing ships for use against static coastal defenses, rocket technology has matured greatly in the years since. Advanced anti-ship and anti-air rocket platforms can now be placed on nearly any vessel in the navy. "
GER_radar_guided_systems: "Radar-Guided Weapon Systems"
GER_radar_guided_systems_desc: "Scientists from BLANK have made significant advancements in radar technology. We now have the ability to arm our warships with advanced point-defense systems. Naval and air threats can be more easily dealt with going forward. "
GER_the_supercarrier: "The Supercarrier"
GER_the_supercarrier_desc: "The increasing size of jet aircraft has necessitated the need for larger carriers. While not a new concept, the Großflugzeugträger, or Supercarrier, will be the largest military vessel ever constructed. Capable of carrying over a hundred assorted aircraft as well as a large assortment of marines and ground vehicles, our supercarrier will tower over all of its contemporaries in the Accord. A highly advanced suite of radar and point-defense systems will ensure nothing can touch it. May the world never forget why Germania rules the waves!"
GER_the_h2o2_torpedo: "The H2O2 Torpedo"
GER_the_h2o2_torpedo_desc: "Several senior U-boat commanders are petitioning OKM to make hydrogen peroxide torpedoes the primary torpedo type of the U-boat service. They argue that the incredible speeds and penetrative potential that high-test peroxide offers far outweigh the dangers that such a propellant offers. Strict safety measures would need to be implemented if they are adopted."
GER_undersea_launch_platforms: "Undersea Launch Platforms"
GER_undersea_launch_platforms_desc: "Launching missiles from a submerged U-boat is not a new concept. Indeed, several tests were made during the later stages of the war to achieve just that. Despite a handful of successful launches, the Sieg series of rockets that were available at the time were deemed too large and cumbersome to be used efficiently. New innovations in both U-boat and missile design, along with advances in weapon guidance systems, have made this a practical venture to pursue."
GER_the_modern_navy: "The Modern Cruiser"
GER_the_modern_navy_desc: "OKM has announced that all heavy cruisers made prior to 1945 will be placed in deep storage as they are too weak and too slow to be of any further use. They have requested that shipwrights design a new class of heavy cruiser that can utilize the latest advancements in naval technology. Speed and firepower is now the order of the day."
GER_advanced_escorts: "Advanced Escorts"
GER_advanced_escorts_desc: "OKM has announced plans for the decommissioning of all escort vessels made prior to 1945. They have requested that shipwrights design new classes of frigates and destroyers for evaluation. Decommissioned ships will either be scrapped, sold or given to friendly nations, placed in emergency reserve, or used as target practice."
GER_advanced_construction_techniques: "Advanced Construction Techniques"
GER_advanced_construction_techniques_desc: "New advances in both design and construction methods has led to a boom in shipbuilding. From U-boats to carriers and everything in between, shipyards everywhere can now fulfill the needs of the Imperial Navy at a fraction of the cost. The future of German naval power has never looked brighter."
GER_expand_the_marine_fliegerabteilung: "Expand the Marine-Fliegerabteilung"
GER_expand_the_marine_fliegerabteilung_desc: "Much to our detriment, naval aviation was largely ignored in the lead up to the Second Weltkrieg. Our naval pilots, poorly trained and equipped, were put at a severe disadvantage when facing off against their superior counterparts in the British and Japanese navies. With aircraft carriers now the backbone of every modern fleet, it is imperative that we address these deficiencies as soon as possible."
GER_modern_carrier_aircraft: "Modern Carrier Aircraft"
GER_modern_carrier_aircraft_desc: "The war with Japan showed us just how far behind our carriers are in comparison to those used by the other major powers. A meeting of the navy's top aviators and Germaniawerft's best engineers is being arranged in Kiel. Their combined knowledge and experience will be used to create the most advanced aircraft carriers in the world."

GER_attracting_skilled_aviators: "Attracting Skilled Aviators"
GER_attracting_skilled_aviators_desc: "Many of the Reich's best pilots are being promoted to non-combat positions or are retiring from the service altogether. It has been suggested that the government recognize gliding as a sport and sponsor its adoption among the youth accordingly. This should theoretically increase the pool of talent that the Luftwaffe can recruit from thereby maintaining the reputation it has earned for having the most skilled pilots in the world."
GER_the_red_barons_legacy: "The Red Baron's Legacy"
GER_the_red_barons_legacy_desc: "Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, the legendary Red Baron and father of the modern German air force, has announced his resignation as head of the Luftwaffe. The announcement comes as a shock to many as the 56-year-old baron was expected to lead the Luftwaffe for several more years but has decided to retire early and enter the political arena. His retirement has a left massive power vacuum in its wake that two competing sides hope to fill: the baron's old friends in the so-called "fighter mafia" at one end and General Ernst Udet at the other."
GER_the_young_ace_galland: "Listen to the Fighter Mafia"
GER_the_young_ace_galland_desc: "Adolf Galland has been appointed as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. An ace with over a hundred victories to his name, Galland is a firm believer in maintaining the dominant position that fighters have held in Luftwaffe doctrine. Only by gaining complete air superiority across the entire theater of operation can one achieve victory. All other considerations are secondary until this goal is met."
GER_the_seasoned_veteran_udet: "Udet's Vision Prevails"
GER_the_seasoned_veteran_udet_desc: "Ernst Udet has been appointed as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. A veteran ace of the First Weltkrieg who flew in the Red Baron's Flying Circus, Udet supports closer cooperation between the branches of the German military. Local air superiority is all one needs in order to adequately support ground and naval forces in their respective operations."
GER_expanded_pilot_training_programs: "Expanded Pilot Training Programs"
GER_expanded_pilot_training_programs_desc: "German pilots performed quite well during the Second Weltkrieg, the Luftwaffe containing the most combat aces of any air force that participated in the conflict. OKL is determined to maintain the excellent reputation that the Reich's airmen have earned by instituting a more intensive training regimen to this effect. Our pilots will be doing barrel rolls in their sleep by the time they graduate."

New contracts with the fine people at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke will help continue our technological edge over the Canadians."
GER_multi_role_jets: "Multi-Role Jets"
GER_multi_role_jets_desc: "The changing face of aerial warfare and aircraft design have blurred the lines between dedicated fighters and their ground attack cousins.

GER_implement_kesselring_doctrine_desc: "Albert Kesselring has been selected to replace the venerable Ludwig Beck as Chief of the Great General Staff. His appointment marks what will surely be a significant shift in army doctrine. Kesselring has long championed for what he calls "Hybridkrieg" or joint warfare. He argues that new advances in technology now allow for the successful integration of the military's service branches into a singular unified command. "A combining of arms" as he's described it. Special considerations need to be made before such an approach can be taken."

An early pioneer and advocate of movement warfare, Guderian is expected to greatly expand the role of tanks in the German army. At the very least, he'll ensure that his precious panzer divisions get preferential treatment when it comes to men and equipment."
GER_promote_interservice_cooperation: "Promote Inter-service Cooperation"
GER_promote_interservice_cooperation_desc: "A healthy bit of rivalry between service branches never hurt anyone. An unhealthy rivalry, like that shared between the Heer and Luftwaffe, can lead to needless loss of life. Subsequently, General Kesselring has made the cooling of tensions between the ground and air services one of his top priorities. Kesselring has taken the unusual approach of having soldiers and airmen of low-to-mid level ranks work together to complete various team building exercises. Likewise, high ranking officers from both branches have had to attend a series of lectures that adherents of the "Kesselring Doctrine" have written. If these measures are successful then we should expect to see a much higher degree of coordination between our forces."
GER_develop_gep_mtw: "Develop the Gep.MTW"
GER_develop_gep_mtw_desc: "The safe and rapid deployment of troops into a combat zone is of paramount importance. To that end, a representative from Auto Union AG has shown us promising designs of what they call an "armored personnel carrier"; a fully enclosed tracked vehicle that has the potential of replacing our aging fleets of trucks and half-tracks.

GER_the_standardpanzer_program: "The Standardpanzer Programme"
GER_the_standardpanzer_program_desc: "Our experiences in the Second Weltkrieg have shown us that the age of fielding multiple weight classes of tanks is over. Our use of large numbers of medium sized tanks proved to be a decisive factor against the Commune's reliance on ever-increasingly heavier models in the later stages of the war in the West. New technologies afford us the ability to create a vehicle that has the firepower of a super-heavy tank and the speed of a light tank inside a medium sized chassis. Our efforts should be focused on making this so-called "Standardpanzer" a reality."
GER_streamline_weapons_procurement: "Streamline Weapon Procurement"
GER_streamline_weapons_procurement_desc: "A key takeaway from the Second Weltkrieg was the need for standardized weapons and equipment. Too often were the soldiers of the Reichspakt forced to scrounge for ammunition and supplies that were compatible with their respective nation's vehicles and weapon systems. A special meeting of high ranking officers from across the alliance has gathered in Potsdam to establish a standardization agreement that all current and future member nations must abide by. This agreement will significantly increase our operational, administrative, and logistical capabilities by allowing member nations to utilize each other's supplies and equipment."

The MKb-42 that was introduced in early 1943 was quite popular with the men who were lucky enough to receive them. Its high penetration and select fire capabilities gave it an edge over similar automatic rifles used by the Russians and Third Internationale. However, the rifle has begun to show its age and it's clear that it will need to be replaced. We shall inform our contacts in the arms industry that we are looking for a new standard issue rifle that will be adopted by the Reichspakt."

GER_fix_becks_mistakes_desc: "Ludwig Beck was widely praised for his handling of the Western Front in the early years of the war. His establishment of the Frankfurt Line prevented Communard forces from establishing sustainable bridgeheads across the Rhine. Heinz Guderian, on the other hand, openly criticized Beck for waging a war of attrition against the Russians on the Eastern Front. For a panzer pioneer like Guderian, the Eastern Front would've been the perfect place to test his concept of "Blitzkrieg", surprise attacks using a rapid and overwhelming concentration of armor, mobile infantry, and close air support. Now in charge of the German army, Guderian can finally set such plans in motion."

But it will-", the other voice stammered before a loud crash could be heard on the other end of the line. Deducing that the Kaiser had destroyed his phone, the head of the colonial office sat down and let out a heavy sigh. The Kaiser knew about the dossier. That meant that time was running out and that something had to be done before it was too late. But who or what could stop Mittelafrika from tearing itself apart?"
GER_europaischer: "The Europaischer Wiederaufbauplan"

GER_announce_warsaw_plan: "Announce the Warsaw Plan"
GER_announce_warsaw_plan_desc: "Before the war, the general consensus among OKH was that the Russians wouldn't pose much of a threat if hostilities between our nations broke out. They argued that a healthy supply of arms to the Ostaaten would be more than sufficient in holding back a Russian offensive until German units could arrive in force. That hypothesis was wrong. The Russians swept over the Ostaaten like a plague of locusts. While many in the government would argue otherwise, having strong allies in the East is better for everyone, even the Reich. To that end, we will aid our friends in strengthening their countries lest we repeat the same mistake twice."

The notion of formalizing a special alliance with these new nations has gained popularity within the government. Proclaiming such states as Herrschaftsgebiets of the crown would go a long way in rebuilding the Reich's prestige. His Majesty is especially enamored with the idea as it will allow him to remain monarch over a sizable portion of the Afrikan continent. Say what you will about the British, but their Commonwealth of Nations wasn't the worst idea they've ever had.

His Majesty has made it clear that he wishes for the Constitution to be amended so that his eldest daughter, Princess Felicitas, can succeed him as German Empress and Queen of Prussia upon his death. While a minority in the Reichstag have voiced their support for such an amendment, the conservative majority remains hesitant.

By placing all of the nation's roads under one administrative authority we will eliminate this inefficiency."

krg_ger.0.t: "Heimdallr's Violent Peace"
krg_ger.0.d: "Glorious Deutschland, the recent years have not been kind to you. Despite facing adversities which would have overwhelmed lesser nations, our great nation has overcome them and once again stands victorious. Unlike in the previous war, victory has come at a high cost.\n\nThe German Empire has endured an overwhelming assault on all sides, both at home and overseas. The despicable Japanese have robbed us of our possessions in the Pacific and Far East, while at home the entirety of the left bank of the Rhine has been desecrated by the French. Even Niederwalddenkmal was not spared from their spiteful wrath. On our eastern flank, our Ost-Wall allies fought bravely, but the Russians managed to push to the gates of Konigsburg, and dissatisfied groups took advantage to rise up against our friendly regimes and their supports. Some question whether we would have been victorious without the Danubian intervention, as their joining allowed us to focus our forces in dealing with the Third Internationale.\n\nNow with the return of peace once more, a tenuous peace brought about by Heimdallr, we look forward into a new era, with old enemies licking their wounds, new enemies seeking to undermine us at every turn."
krg_ger.0.a: "Deutschland shall overcome all once more!"

krg_ger.1.t: "The German Empire, 1948"
krg_ger.1.d: "Deutschland, standing at the top of the world. Having taken everything her enemies threw at her and more. After the Dirksen Government fumbled the nation into Black Monday, the Kaiser's will prevailed and a new government under Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher was formed! The excellent and decisive leadership of the Red General also led to the formation of the Deutschenationale Einheitsfront (DNEF) (German National Unity Front) which centralised decision making outside of the Bundesrat and Reichstag. With this tightened war-executive under the Enabling Act, the tides turned and once more Deutschland vanquished her enemies.\n\nReichskanzler Schleicher unfortunately is no longer with us, the stresses of wartime leadership taking their toll. His health ultimately betrayed him before he could see the victory of his policies. His long-time protege Ferdinand von Bredow succeeded him in the position of leader of the DNEF and thus as Reichskanzler. \n\nWith that ascent to the highest post in the government, he finished what his 'chief' started. Now he stands at the helm of a government whose continued existence depends on war-time emergency legislation, and there are questions as to when that will expire."
krg_ger.1.a: "Deutschland Über Alles!"

krg_ger.2.t: "The Red Baron's Legacy"
krg_ger.2.d: "Generalfeldmarschall Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, the legendary Rote Kampfflieger and first Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. Many would argue that his reorganization of the army's air corps, the Luftstreitkräfte, into an independent service branch in the late 1930's, saved Germany.\n\nThe operational flexibility that the new Luftwaffe gained is credited as an important factor that prevented major cities like Dresden, Munich, and Berlin from being bombed into oblivion by British and French strategic bombers. Likewise, bold investments in the embryonic field of jet technology and subsequent work in developing streamlined production has resulted in the Reich possessing the world's largest and most advanced air force in the world. \n\nToday, this hero of the nation, has announced his intention to retire from the armed forces in order to make a clean break  and enter politics, a decision that has blindsided and surprised many."
krg_ger.2.a: "Who can possibly fill his shoes?"

krg_ger.3.t: "The Deutsches Heer"
krg_ger.3.d: "The Deutsches Heer is the largest army in the world, standing victorious with two of the most elite and battle hardened generations of commanders and soldiers after they successfully prosecuted victories in two brutal weltkriegs.\n\nOf course, now that the war has been won, it is time for the conscripts to return home and military expenditure reduced accordingly in order to reap the dividends of peace. Needless to say, this action will face stiff opposition from much of the high command, who call out and speak publicly of remaining wary of Russian intentions in Eastern Europe and the revanchist Entente powers who lurk at the borders of our sphere.\n\nTheir natural inclination is to look forward to fight and win the next war. They are still sore about their lack of a chance to retain control of German East Asia, but it doesn't hurt to have some of the world's finest minds in the General Staff, working to keep the country safe."
krg_ger.3.a: "Germany, an Army with a State."

krg_ger.4.t: "Kaiser Wilhelm II's Dreadnoughts"
krg_ger.4.d: "The Kaiserliche Marine, is the largest fleet in the world on a quantitative basis. \n\nBut numbers are deceiving; Kaiser Wilhelm II's greatest project, while seemingly world-class, is in fact a second-tier fighting force. This was made painfully evident during the war, where the Japanese aircraft carriers and their support fleets were able to dance around our vaunted dreadnoughts, picking them off with ease.\n\n Our fleet is large, but almost useless. Unable to operate outside of the range of land-based aircraft thanks to the emergence of naval aviation, plenty of work must be done to restore the Kaiserliche Marine to its former glory. We cannot expect to operate as a global superpower when we have a fleet that cannot effectively project power outside of the North Sea!"
krg_ger.4.a: "The decay must stop here!"

krg_ger.5.t: "The Next OHL"
krg_ger.5.d: "Generalfeldmarschall Ludwig Beck, Commander-in-Chief of the Heer for the past seven years, has announced his imminent retirement. Beck's time as head of the army was a critical one for Germany. By the time he took command of the army, his predecessor in the role, Ferdinand von Bredow, had failed to prevent the Third Internationale from overrunning Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhineland. Indeed, it was only through the intervention of newly appointed Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher that Bredow managed to save himself from further disgrace when the former appointed him Vizekanzler in 1941.\n\nWorking closely with fellow field marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Beck was able to stabilize the Western Front along the Frankfurt Line before shifting focus on halting the Russian advance in the East, a task that was ably delegated to the Danubian armies once they were ready to take on the task. Even then, the German Army fought on for four more years of bloodshed and attrition that would see the Fall of Paris and the fighting retreat of the Russian hordes leaving thousands of hectares in the east burned and ruined wasteland.\n\nWhile vindicated as a competent and effective leader, the stress of command has left the good general exhausted. His retirement has come as no surprise and is rumored to have been in the works for sometime. From the upper echelons of the General Staff there are two names that have emerged as possible successors to one of the world's most powerful positions:"
krg_ger.5.a: "General der Panzertruppe Heinz Guderian shall carry the torch."
krg_ger.5.b: "General der Artillerie Albert Kesselring is the man for the job."

krg_ger.6.t: "Unrest in the Rhineland"
krg_ger.6.d: "The Rhineland has been in turmoil since its liberation from the French invaders. The collaborationist government that was set up after the initial occupation, along with the subsequent occupation, has left visible scars upon the region. Its infrastructure in ruins, and capital flight has left our former industrial heartlands depressingly weak. Despite our best efforts in rebuilding the region, it's clearly not been enough to satisfy the Rhinesh residents; general discontent due to a perceived 'lack of support' has boiled over, and there has been regular protests and strikes throughout the region.\n\nLong-serving Mayor of Köln and veteran Zentrum politician Konrad Adenauer often stays out of Berlin's affairs, following his failed stints in federal politics. However, the old man has lodged an official request to the Kanzleramt, requesting that we aid in de-escalation efforts. Of course, many avenues of assistance lay open for us, though Bredow has already said he'd veto any action that is too 'lenient' on the syndicalist sympathisers that 'infest the Rhineland', which includes ordering loyal paramilitaries to stand down."
krg_ger.6.a: "Instruct the Verdeckte Reichspolizei to hunt for Syndicalist leaders."
krg_ger.6.b: "Award Police in the Rhineland emergency powers, to bolster enforcement efforts."

krg_ger.7.t: "Massacre in Köln"
krg_ger.7.d: "It appears that Köln was more of a tinderbox than we imagined. Yesterday, a Freikorps division tasked with assisting the Köln police forcefully cracked down on a protest march for the restoration of workers rights, a crackdown which turned violent and rather bloody. Normally, the Kaiser would applaud such initative against the Syndicalists, but it has backfired horribly.\n\nToday, riots have engulfed the city, and Mayor Adenauer is furious at the Reichskanzler for awarding Freikorps units in the region the extrajudical powers they have. The old man has demanded we act and act fast, and in a brief meeting with Reichskanzler Bredow, the Kaiser has echoed the sentiment. In an emergency meeting with his fellow ministers, Bredow established the potential plan.\n\nMany suggested that the Reichskanzler personally venture to Köln, to represent the Kaiser and help defuse the situation personally. Herbert von Bose understandably baulked at the idea, pointing out that the growing rioting has created a rather dangerous atmosphere, and if anything were to happen to the Reichskanzler it'd only worsen the chaos. In his stead, the experienced minister suggested sending the former Papal Diplomat and Bavarian DNEF member Rudolf Buttmann, whose credentials would surely be welcomed by the majority-catholic city. Bredow now has to decide, does he send Buttmann, or does he go personally?"
krg_ger.7.a: "The Chancellor shall personally visit Köln to pacify the situation!"
krg_ger.7.b: "Let us send the experienced negoitator Herr Buttmann instead."

krg_ger.8.t: "Bredow arrives in Köln"
krg_ger.8.d: "Today Reichskanzler Bredow arrived in Köln to a scene of carnage. This cannot be allowed to spiral out of control!"

krg_ger.10.d: "Reichskanzler Bredow gave a speech in front of the great cathedral of Köln today. He spoke about uniting our nation, overcoming great adversity, and the resilience of the German people, to the cheers and jeers of the crowd."
krg_ger.10.a: "He is right, why are we fighting amongst ourselves?"
krg_ger.10.b: "Easy to say when he does not face any of the hardships we do!"

krg_ger.15.d: "The afternoon air at the Rathausplatz in Köln was calm as the Reichskanzler Bredow was driven away from the area in his armored car. However, the silence was broken by a deafening explosion. Bystanders reported that the rear of the Sd.Kfz 247 was lifted several feet in the air before crashing back down to the pavement, the back tires blown off. Police and fire personnel arrived at the scene minutes later, and a heavily wounded Bredow was driven to the hospital in a civilian's car. At the moment he is in intensive care, with emergency surgery imminent. However, it is unclear if the Reichskanzler will survive the night.\n\nInitial investigation of the explosion is currently underway, with signs pointing towards a terrorist attack against the most powerful politician in Germany. However, it is unknown who exactly is responsible, though there are certainly suspicions."

krg_ger.24.a: "Take them out, root and stem!"

krg_ger.25.t: "The Köln Negotiations Continue"
krg_ger.25.d: "Scores of diplomats have been sent to Köln to assist in negotiations with the protest leaders. Their demands are numerous and often contradictory, as to be expected from such people."
krg_ger.25.a: "Keep trying for the Kaiser wills it."

krg_ger.26.t: "Their Final Demands"
krg_ger.26.d: "The Protest leaders have issued their final demands to the Reichskanzler."
krg_ger.26.a: "We must agree to their demands."
krg_ger.26.b: "Enough! Send in the Heer!"

krg_ger.27.t: "Protests in Köln Dissapate"
krg_ger.27.d: "Negotiations between government diplomats and Köln protest leaders have reached a successful conclusion. With their most dire demands met, protest leaders have told their followers that it is safe for them to return home. While certainly a blow to our prestige, most in the government are satisfied with the outcome and are ready to move on from the crisis."
krg_ger.27.a: "Cooler Heads have Prevailed."

krg_ger.28.t: "Peace in the Rhineland"
krg_ger.28.d: "With the Köln Crisis finally resolved, peace and stability has returned to the Rhineland. The men and women of the region have returned to their homes and jobs; happy in the knowledge that they have played a major role in the preservation of German democracy. For now, the great work of rebuilding the empire's industrial heart goes on."
krg_ger.28.a: "For a better Germany."

krg_ger.29.t: "Peace in the Rhineland"

krg_ger.29.a: "The Menace has been stamped out."

krg_ger.30.t: "Konrad Adenauer Resigns"
krg_ger.30.d: "With the continued martial law in his city, the Mayor of Köln has resigned. He has been deeply critical of the DNEF's brutal actions in the Rhineland, and his resignation is a prime opportunity to put one of our men in charge of the city!"
krg_ger.30.a: "Farewell, old man."

krg_ger.31.t: "Widespread Political Criticism"
krg_ger.31.d: "The backlash against the Reichskanzler for placing Köln under martial law was swift. Beyond his immediate political allies, widespread condemnation of the decision was expressed across the political spectrum, uniting the opposition in a way that transcended usual politics.\n\nThe Reichskanzler defended these measures, citing Syndicalist insurrection, administrative incompetence, and the scale of violence as factors necessitating extraordinary measures - arguments that have done little to stem the criticism echoed by papers, media, and political figures.\n\nWhile the Köln Crisis has been resolved, the methods taken will almost certainly not be forgotten by the Reichskanzler's enemies and rivals - nor the general public. It is likely that only when martial law is fully lifted, and normalcy is restored, the full impact of the Reichskanzler's decisions will be felt."
krg_ger.31.a: "We are doing what we must, so that Germany can survive."

krg_ger.32.t: "Köln Syndicalist Cell Crushed"
krg_ger.32.d: "While the impact of the Köln Crisis continues to be felt across Germany, good news has reached Berlin. Operations against a major Syndicalist cell operating in Köln have concluded successfully, crushing the cell, and seizing all subsequent assets.\n\nThe leaders and associates of this cell were arrested and are currently being detained under heavy military guard as they await their trail and conviction. Dozens more Syndicalists were also detained or killed, and survivors driven away or underground. It is almost certain that without leadership, any survivors will struggle to reconstitute themselves.\n\nWhile the measures were extensive, this has dealt a significant blow to Syndicalism in Germany. With Köln successfully pacified, we can be assured that there will be no more Syndicalist agitation here, and sends an important message to any Syndicalist traitors remaining in our midst."
krg_ger.32.a: "Good riddance."

krg_ger.33.t: "The [GetYear] Kriegszeit Presseregelungsgestz"
krg_ger.33.d: "The execution of the newly expanded Kriegszeit Presseregelungsgesetz did not happen without controversy. While Bredow made a strong case for its necessity to the public, it is failing to persuade many of the more liberal-minded and left-wing opponents who were already critical of the original Act.\n\nLiberals and social democrats alike have been near-universal in their condemnation of Bredow's expansion, risking severe consequences, but doing so to rally public pressure against Bredow to convince him to back down - something that Bredow has already ruled out.\n\nThe effects of the law are already being felt, and papers that have been critical of Bredow's policies have already been sent warnings and notices to comply or be shut down. While public anger will likely simmer for some time, eventually it can be expected to fade as national media adjusts to the new legal expectations."
krg_ger.33.a: "For a loyal nation."

krg_ger.34.t: "Wilhelm III opens the 1948 Reichstag"
krg_ger.34.d: "Though a currently neutered institution, the Reichstag is still a constitutionally important part of Germany. While everyone knows that the Deutsche Nationale Einheitsfront are running the country in all meaningful senses, the legislation that allows them to still emanates from the Reichstag.\n\nToday, as he met with the members of the Imperial Diet, Kaiser Wilhelm formally opened the 1948 Reichstag to a round of applause, though the enthusiasm from some sections of the assembly was rather muted compared to that of the DNEF men.\n\nThe SPD deputies were in the back, mildly rancourous since their fall from grace corresponded with a rise in Germany's fortunes in the war, and the Kaiser has never seen eye to eye with their politics anyway."
krg_ger.34.a: "Happy New Year!"

krg_ger.35.t: "Reichskanzler von Bredow Speaks"
krg_ger.35.d: "Following on from the Reichstag's opening last week, Reichskanzler Ferdinand von Bredow took the time today to speak at length to the deputies of the Imperial Diet.\n\n His speech was typical of the rhetoric that he has been using for the past year, working over the ground that has now been well planted. He has continued to make a decisive and structured, slow-burn bid to grow organic support for his reforms in the corridors of state power. There are many in the Reichstag who still see the DNEF as an imposition in the workings of the state, but there are also those who are willing to see it as the next evolution of the Constitution of 1920.\n\nThe speech went rather well, with the Reichskanzler finishing on a simple, quotable note that was taken up by the newspapers."
krg_ger.35.a: "We must heal our wounds."
krg_ger.35.b: "We must rebuild our might."
krg_ger.35.c: "We must reform our nation."

krg_ger.36.t: "Cardinal Josef Frings applauds the Speech"
krg_ger.36.d: "Josef Frings, leader of the Fulda Conference of Bishops and known Zentrum associate, has celebrated Reichskanzler von Bredow's call for unity and healing. In his reported remarks, he commented that the country was now in a place to reap the peace dividend, and that national healing was of the highest priority when it came to solving the problems that ailed the nation in the aftermath of the Second Weltkrieg "
krg_ger.36.a: "We're all in this together."

krg_ger.37.t: "Feldmarschall Ludwig Beck applauds the Speech"
krg_ger.37.d: "Ludwig Beck, hero of the Second Weltkrieg and formal chief commander of the Heer has celebrated Reichskanzler von Bredow's call for rearmament and strengthening. In his published remarks, he stated that a continual programme of military development and the expansion of the nuclear arsenal would provide amply for the future of the German Empire, before quoting Tacitus' famous remark \"If you wish for peace, prepare for war\"."
krg_ger.37.a: "Vigilance, strength, victory."

krg_ger.38.t: "Outrage from the Moderates"
krg_ger.38.d: "Moderate delegates from the Zentrum, the BVP, the LVP and the SPD have all denounced Bredow's speech, claiming he is trying to snuff out the remaining sparks of German Democracy.\n\nWhile there are plenty in the DNEF who will admit behind closed doors that they're right, of course, they feel that it is an embarrassing outcome of the speech that there has been a public hue and cry about the move towards a more centralised government being tarred in such negative terms."
krg_ger.38.a: "Oh well."

krg_ger.39.t: "Rumours in the Reichstag"
krg_ger.39.d: "The Grand Coalition has held for years, but with the war over there are rumours that it may not be long for this world. The agreement is showing signs of cracking at the seams as the moderate forces in the Reichstag are becoming increasingly wary of Reichkanzler von Bredow's clearly dictatorial intentions.\n\nThe legal foundation of the DNEF however is the Enabling Act, which still has some time left before it's legality ends."
krg_ger.39.a: "What was that about unity?"

krg_ger.40.t: "Collapse of the Grand Coalition"
krg_ger.40.d: "Today, the Zentrum and BVP formally pulled their support from the Grand Coalition, causing the collapse of the coalition.\n\nThe decision was controversial, but absolute. With the rump of the DkP and the DVLP as our only sitting representatives in the Reichstag, this puts the support for the government in the house into a precarious position. This is a heavy blow to Reichskanzler von Bredow's DNEF administration."
krg_ger.40.a: "A blow to our legitimacy."

krg_ger.41.t: "Meeting with the Ministries"
krg_ger.41.d: "After the ending of the Grand Coalition, the DNEF has been scrambling to tap civil servants and ensure the Civil Service is able to provide the needed information and advice to the governing executive.\n\nThe DNEF has managed to solidify command of the state apparatus to such a point that the falling out of the Coalition partners has actually demonstrated the resilience of the organisation. If the state can survive the failure of the democratic alliance in government, then perhaps that is no longer needed, surely?"
krg_ger.41.a: "The Einheitsfront marches on."

krg_ger.42.t: "The Enabling Act expires!"
krg_ger.42.d: "The failure of the DNEF to complete the centralising reforms of the Neuer Staat has meant that the Enabling Act has expired without a completed replacement behind it. Since the Enabling Act partially formed the legal basis for the DNEF to exist and hold government offices, the organisation has been dissolved.\n\nHard words are being had in Berlin between the Kaiser and the now rudderless DNEF organisation.\n\nFor the interim, the Deutschkonservative Partei (DkP) have taken the reins of government and it's leader Carl Goerdeler has been sworn in as Reichskanzler until the 1951 election."
krg_ger.42.a: "Mein Gott, ein Katastrof!"

krg_ger.43.t: "Negotiating with the DNAP"
krg_ger.43.d: "DNAP want some minor welfare policies enshrined in law, based on some of the ideas that Schleicher himself discussed before his death."
krg_ger.43.a: "Honouring the Chief's legacy is a good excuse."
krg_ger.43.b: "This is tantamount to Syndicalism!"

krg_ger.44.t: "Negotiating with the National Liberals"
krg_ger.44.d: "The National Liberals, influnced by their wealthy backers, want pro-business reforms for their support. The main element is some rather major tax breaks."
krg_ger.44.a: "Some tax reform was in order anyway."
krg_ger.44.b: "We need the money that business tax provides."

krg_ger.45.t: "Negotiating with the National Liberals"
krg_ger.45.d: "Owing to Popitz's business-friendly policies, the National Liberals have pledged their support to our government (though some of their members appear to be less than enthused)."
krg_ger.45.a: "Wonderful"

krg_ger.46.t: "Negotiating with Brüning"
krg_ger.46.d: "Heinrich Brüning drives a very hard bargain, being himself rather torn on the New State model. If we are to get his support, we must implement a series of laws to protect the position of the Catholic Church, which Brüning believe's our reforms will compliment, irrespective of the irritation Protestant members of the government are already feeling."
krg_ger.46.a: "For the good of the Empire."
krg_ger.46.b: "Insanity. Let the catholics burn themselves out."

krg_ger.47.t: "Negotiating with Papen"
krg_ger.47.d: "Franz von Papen has a simple request: he wants control over the Foreign Ministry, and as such a seat at the table when it comes to governance."
krg_ger.47.a: "Appoint the Baron, he can be trusted."
krg_ger.47.b: "Our Cabinet must remain above partisan politics."

krg_ger.48.t: "Negotiating with the BVP"
krg_ger.48.d: "The Bavarians want extra funding diverted to Munich, which will be spent on primarily renovating pre-war infrastructure and services, if they are to support our new regime."
krg_ger.48.a: "I'm sure Bavaria can get some extra investment."
krg_ger.48.b: "Bloody Bavarians, ignore their moaning."

krg_ger.49.t: "Negotiating with the BVP"
krg_ger.49.d: "With Brüning's Zentrum 'Moderates' already in support, the Bavarians have chosen to stick with their political ally and lend their support as well."
krg_ger.49.a: "Well that was easy."

krg_ger.50.t: "Negotiating with the Polish"
krg_ger.50.d: "The Polish delegates have requested that some funding be invested into Posen, an often forgetten region of Prussia that the Poles believe requires some renovation."
krg_ger.50.a: "Posen is long overdue investment."
krg_ger.50.b: "We cant spare the funds."

krg_ger.51.t: "Negotiating with the Independent Conservatives"
krg_ger.51.d: "The various Independent Conservatives have agreed to support...for a rather steep sum of money. They claim the money will be invested into their constituencies, but its clear that they basically want a bribe from the Federal government."
krg_ger.51.a: "We can pencil this away as 'Expenses'."
krg_ger.51.b: "There is no magic money tree for you."
krg_ger.51.c: "Apply some pressure, they're clearly desperate."

krg_ger.52.t: "Negotiating with the Agrarians"
krg_ger.52.d: "As expected, to get the Agrarian's support we'll need to pass some bills for them. They have submitted a bumper-pack of agrarian reforms for approval by the Reichskanzler, which will no doubt be expensive."
krg_ger.52.a: "Pass the Bills, some extra Grain will do nicely."
krg_ger.52.b: "We have Ukraine for this..."

krg_ger.53.t: "Negotiating with the Regionalists"
krg_ger.53.d: "The Regionalist parties have come together with their request, additional infrastructure funding in their various constituencies. Delegates from Luxembourg, Hannover and Alsace have all requested additional funding."
krg_ger.53.a: "The Autobahn could do with extending."
krg_ger.53.b: "Its not worth the money."

krg_ger.54.t: "Negotiating with the Regionalists"
krg_ger.54.d: "After the concessions we offered the Polish, the Luxembourgish, Hannoverian and Alsacian delegates have all demanded large amounts of infrastructual investment if we're to get their votes."
krg_ger.54.a: "The Autobahn could do with extending."
krg_ger.54.b: "Thats a ridiculous demand, throw them out."

krg_ger.55.t: "Pressuring the Independent Conservatives"
krg_ger.55.d: "After some pressure was applied, the Independent Conservatives predictably folded. They'll join the DkP in supporting the act."
krg_ger.55.a: "Simple Politics."

krg_ger.56.t: "Investments in Bavaria"
krg_ger.56.d: "As a result of our negotiations with the BVP, we have finalized a substantial investment package for Bavaria which will provide the region with much-needed injection of capital, additional resources, and new jobs which will benefit the region for years to come.\n\nWith this investment we have demonstrated our commitment to working with, and supporting the BVP by acknowledging and meeting their needs. We will be able to rely on them to return the favor in the future and ensure our own political ambitions are achieved."
krg_ger.56.a: "A solid investment, the Bavarians should be grateful."

krg_ger.57.t: "Investments in Posen"
krg_ger.57.d: "As a result of our negotiations with the Polish Regionalists, we have finalized a substantial investment package for Posen which will provide the region with much-needed injection of capital, additional resources, and new jobs which will benefit the region for years to come.\n\nWith this investment we have demonstrated our commitment to working with, and supporting the German Poles by acknowledging and meeting their needs. We will be able to rely on them to return the favor in the future and ensure our own political ambitions are achieved."
krg_ger.57.a: "The Poles better be happy."

krg_ger.58.t: "Investments on the Periphery"
krg_ger.58.d: "As a result of our negotiation efforts with smaller regional parties, we have finalized a substantial investment into the periphery regions of Germany, which will provide injections of capital, additional resources, more jobs, and better infrastructure that is severely needed for these oft-neglected regions.\n\nThese investments should ensure a gradual improvement in the standard of living for all citizens in the region. With this investment we have committed to improving the lives of citizens across Germany in a tangible way, and can expect those representing their interests to remember our support, and return the favor when called upon."
krg_ger.58.a: "For a more connected Empire."

krg_ger.59.t: "Investments on the Periphery"
krg_ger.59.d: "As a result of multiple arduous negotiation efforts, we have finalized an investment into the periphery regions of the Empire, which will provide a moderate injection of capital, resources, jobs, and infrastructure expansion that are severely needed for these oft-neglected regions.\n\nUnfortunately, these investments are unlikely to result in either substantial improvement for the region, or political support due to the staunch opposition of the moderate wing of the Zentrum which hindered our negotiation efforts with the smaller regional parties. \n\nWhile some citizens will appreciate our attempts, it is at best a compromise that few seem happy with, and we should not expect this to translate into permanent support or political capital."
krg_ger.59.a: "Barely worth the cost."

krg_ger.60.t: "Völkisch Organisations Fade"
krg_ger.60.d: "As we move closer to the New State, the radical Völkisch groups, such as Heinrich Claß's Deutschvölkische Freiheitspartei, are quickly losing support. It'd appear that their 'moderate' supporters are jumping ship with the Zentralisierungsakt fast approaching."
krg_ger.60.a: "Claß is a good man, but the less power he has the better..."

krg_ger.61.t: "Radical Newspapers Banned"
krg_ger.61.d: "Over the course of several days, some moderately-sized and popular papers have been officially shut down by German law enforcement officials, finding them in violation of several provisions included in the recently amended Presseregelungsgesetz.\n\nThese papers were known for their radical liberalism, and their writers were often accused or implied to have even more radical left-wing and even Syndicalist sentiments. While these are the first papers to be brought in line with Bredow's centralization efforts, they will almost certainly not be the last.\n\nIt is expected that there will be more papers, particularly those affiliated with the political opposition, which will need to be shut down down before a new normal is established. This period will be difficult, but eventually, it will be ensured that no more dangerous, radical, and illegal ideas can infest the minds of the German public."
krg_ger.61.a: "Good Riddance."

krg_ger.62.t: "Vorwärts Circulation 'Changes'"
krg_ger.62.d: "Despite the clear necessity of the amendment to the Presseregelungsgesetz, and Bredow's efforts to halt the circulation of dangerous materials, there remain plenty of individuals and groups who are willing to take extreme measures to circumvent the law through purportedly 'legitimate' means.\n\nThe SPD has been using their significant organizational strength and connections to circumvent the restrictions for media outlets that are directed tied to, or supported by the SPD. For every one of these criminal papers shuttered, circulation of dissident materials remains in circulation.\n\nIt is clear that the SPD have no intention of complying with the law, and are signaling their willingness to fight it by either forcing us to take stronger measures, or relent and accept this state of affairs - with the expectation that they know where the line is drawn."
krg_ger.62.a: "Damn Socialists"
krg_ger.62.b: "We must keep rooting out socialist media."

krg_ger.63.t: "Kölnische Volkszeitung Circulation Falls"
krg_ger.63.d: "The Kölnische Volkszeitung is one of the oldest papers in Germany, first founded in 1868, and the largest Catholic-oriented paper currently in circulation. They possess outsized influence, especially among the Catholic population - and have been a paper with a clear liberal slant.\n\nOutright banning such a prominent paper would be difficult to do without significant backlash. Instead, alternative efforts were taken to restrict its reach that have successfully disputed their output, including revoking their ability to distribute in several major cities, leading to their papers being quite literally taken off the shelves.\n\nWhile they remain able to print, their circulation has dropped significantly, and as a result we can expect their influence to gradually diminish to a point where they can be permanently shuttered with minimal controversy."
krg_ger.63.a: "Good to see our plans in action."

krg_ger.64.t: "Complaints from Abteilung Veterans"
krg_ger.64.d: "The decision to merge the Abteilung and Verpo did not come without controversy - both in and outside the organizations in question. Some members of the Abteilung, including experienced veterans, expressed concerns or outright opposition to the decision for different reasons.\n\nMany of the concerns were practical, such as what role they would hold after the merger, but many others appeared skeptical over the rationale for the decision in the first place, insinuating it served no reason other than to increase Bredow's control over the already-powerful Verpo.\n\nIt seems unlikely that many of these veterans can be dissuaded from their stances, and it has been made clear that the merger will happen - and those who are opposed are welcome to find employment elsewhere. Despite the complaints, it is impossible to see a reversal happening. The Reichskanzler has made his choice, and veterans or not, he will not be dissuaded from it."
krg_ger.64.a: "Let the Old Men moan."

krg_ger.65.t: "Finalising the Merger"
krg_ger.65.d: "It has taken some time, but the merger between the Abteilung and Verpo is nearly complete. Much of the institutional reorganization has been finalized, appropriate personnel transferred, and a new chain of command approved. Redundant personnel were released from service, along with individuals who opposed the merger.\n\nIn a press conference which the Reichskanzler attended, the heads of both organizations announced the finalization of the merger, and Bredow spoke briefly of the necessity of the decision, reiterating that it was made in the interests of security, and that the enlarged and empowered Verpo would ensure the security of the Empire against Syndicalist and Accord threats.\n\nThe crowd of reporters, officers, and curated guests responded positively, with any critics holding their tongues. Wider public sentiment is still unknown, and most people appear to be waiting to see what new Verpo does with their new capabilities, and if they stick to the mandate that Bredow laid out."
krg_ger.65.a: "We Protect and Serve the Empire."

krg_ger.66.t: "Detention of Socialist Activists"
krg_ger.66.d: "Earlier in the day, the Verpo executed several raids throughout Berlin and several other major cities in the homes of known political activists. Few were surprised by the news, considering that the targeted individuals were known to hold strong left-wing views, and suspected Syndicalist sympathies.\n\nFollowing the arrests, the Verpo announced charges against the activities, confirming them as socialists. Several pieces of seized evidence were shown to journalists, which clearly showed support for socialist policies, individuals, and movements. The Verpo announced that they were thoroughly reviewing the evidence, and warned that any individuals connected to these criminals would be found and arrested.\n\nThe released evidence was not wholly accepted by skeptics, suggesting that the evidence presented was thin, and while they might be socialists, it was not evidence of deeper Syndicalist sympathies. However, the skeptics are a minority, and backlash has been minimal. Time will soon tell what the Verpo discover as they dig deeper."
krg_ger.66.a: "Look around for any dirt."

krg_ger.67.t: "Criminal Activity Unearthed"
krg_ger.67.d: "Further review of the evidence from the detained socialist activists has contained several surprising and shocking revelations. Evidence not only of Syndicalist sympathies, but active plans of resistance and insurrection have been uncovered from the belongings of several of the detained activists.\n\nThese plans were minimally detailed, but it was undeniable proof that coordination of some sort was taking place between Syndicalists and left-wing sympathizers to undermine, and eventually destroy the Empire. It remains unclear how extensive this network is, or to the extent the plans have proceeded.\n\nIt is clear that there is a broader plan at work; a plot that threatens the stability and security of the Empire. Interrogations against the activists have been authorized, and all the details of this treasonous activity will be uncovered one way or another."
krg_ger.67.a: "A Conspiracy against the Kaiser? Dig deeper!"

krg_ger.68.t: "Syndicalist SPD Entryists Discovered"
krg_ger.68.d: "Interrogations of socialist activists and additional investigations have confirmed what we were most afraid of - this conspiracy extends not just to the street rabble, but to the halls of Reichstag itself. Verpo agents confirmed that there are Syndicalists within the ranks of the SPD, and are working to recruit and spread further.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the majority of the SPD appears unaware of this infiltration - though they are ill-positioned to halt it. It is clear that too many of the SPD are apathetic to the threat that Syndicalism poses to the Empire, and this dangerous ideology having a foothold in one of the largest German political parties is intolerable.\n\nOperations have been authorized to remove these Syndicalist Entryists, and from them we will see how far this web spreads. It will also serve as a warning to the SPD that they must take measures to prevent further infiltration - with further consequences implied if they fail to do so."
krg_ger.68.a: "Doing the world a favor."

krg_ger.69.t: "Agents Infiltrate the SPD"
krg_ger.69.d: ""The one good thing about leftists is their proclivity for infighting. With that in mind, you are to direct your efforts at destabilizing the SPD by this avenue. You are free to approach this task by whatever means. I recommend keeping our friend {REDACTED} in mind as a forged signature can go a long way.""
krg_ger.69.a: "Taking them apart, piece by piece."

krg_ger.70.t: "Verpo Agents Begin to Act"
krg_ger.70.d: "It has become clear that the SPD has become a security risk to the Empire, one that they seem incapable or unwilling to address. While we do not possess proof of Syndicalist sympathies in SPD leadership, we have enough justification to begin conducting more extensive observation on them.\n\nPlans have been developed within the Verpo, and authorized by the Reichskanzler, that will execute several surveillance operations against the SPD, allowing the Verpo to more closely observe, infiltrate, and act against any in the SPD who pose a threat to German interests or seek to sabotage the state.\n\nVerpo agents have already begun to infiltrate the SPD, and their leadership, as well as several major figures within the party, have had dedicated surveillance placed on them. One way or another, we will find how deep the rot goes in the SPD, and will now be in a position to correct it when the time comes."
krg_ger.70.a: "Go forth, divide and conquer."

krg_ger.71.t: "SPD Meeting Implodes"
krg_ger.71.d: "We have received reports about a major meeting within the SPD, which sought to unify the party and decide a unified line against what they see as "unprecedented oppression by the state against the SPD." Some likely seek this for pragmatic reasons, and almost certainly encouraged by Syndicalist sympathizers to provide cover for their activities.\n\nFortunately, our Verpo agents operating within the SPD were able to ensure that the meeting failed. By utilizing certain pieces of information gathered from our surveillance and exploiting clashes, rivalries, and blackmail, they were able to drive wedges between members, slow the proceedings with bureaucratic technicalities, all of which resulted in the meeting devolving into accusations of Syndicalist sympathies between multiple SPD representatives.\n\nThe SPD meeting was successfully derailed, and it is likely that they will be even more divided moving forward. We can be assured that, for now, SPD internal unity is broken, and this event has opened new opportunities to further exploit and divide them in future operations."
krg_ger.71.a: "Excellent work."

krg_ger.72.t: "SPD Infighting Continues to Rise"
krg_ger.72.d: "The latest report from {REDACTED} has revealed that infighting among SPD members has increased dramatically over the past few weeks. Tensions are so high that a brawl between {REDACTED} and {REDACTED} is said to have broken out. SPD leadership is expected to collapse within the next two to three months."
krg_ger.72.a: "And all it took was one well placed agent."

krg_ger.73.t: "Consulting Herbert von Bose"
krg_ger.73.d: "As the German state apparatus continues to modernize under Bredow's leadership, attention must inevitably turn towards the top of the hierarchy. There must be some changes to the ministries to bring them in line - though what these changes have not been decided. To this end, Bredow has sought the advice of Herbert von Bose on possible ways to improve the ministries and efficiency of the state.\n\nThe conversation was a productive one, with Bose presenting several ideas that would eliminate redundancy, empower the Imperial Cabinet, and streamline the current system. It would result in a more efficient government, bringing much needed modernization to the administration.\n\nIt is an extensive overhaul that would require significant changes, and is likely to draw opposition even within the state - but the results would almost certainly justify the disruption inflicted."
krg_ger.73.a: "Lets see if radical change has radical results."

krg_ger.74.t: "Streamlining the Cabinet"
krg_ger.74.d: "Bredow's announcement of the reorganization of the ministries, and the Imperial Cabinet was met with a mixed response across the political spectrum, and within the government itself. Despite approval from the Kaiser, it was not enough to stem the impact of the decision as the consequences were quickly felt across the Ministries.\n\nThe new Imperial Cabinet had done away with much of the formerly redundant and byzantine roles and hierarchies within the Ministries, merging several together, cutting or consolidating positions, and increasing the powers and responsibilities of each respective Secretary, thus reducing the overall workload of the Reichskanzler.\n\nThese changes were justified by Bredow as being necessary for the modernization of the Empire, which he promises will lead to improved efficiency, coordination, and prosperity for Germany and the Reichspakt. However, in the process, many individuals part of the Ministries have been demoted or removed - a black cloud that lingers despite the attempts of the Reichskanzler to downplay it."
krg_ger.74.a: "Some of them may go, but thats a sacrifice we must make."

krg_ger.75.t: "Complaints from the Secretaries"
krg_ger.75.d: "The streamlining of the Ministries has led to an extensive number of complaints and concerns from numerous Secretaries. Several appeared unprepared for the increased workloads, are unclear of certain details of departments they inherited, and are dealing with confusion and anger from personnel negatively affected by the reorganization.\n\nThe number of complaints across the Ministries have been greater than anticipated, and there appears to be widespread skepticism and disapproval to the reorganization. Should the Secretaries fail to adjust to their new needs or duties, the gains anticipated by this decision may not materialize as soon as we hoped.\n\nHowever, a period of adjustment is necessary, and for now we will do our best to assuage their concerns, while reminding them of their duty to the Empire. If this fails to motivate them, then additional measures may have to be considered."
krg_ger.75.a: "Tell them it'll all be for the best."

krg_ger.76.t: "A Government for the 20th Century"
krg_ger.76.d: "While there were difficulties and hurdles in the process of streamlining the state bureaucracy, the dust has settled, and enough time has passed to appraise the results. Fortunately, these initial indications are positive.\n\nDespite the initial disruption, the Ministries have fallen into a regular rhythm, and are functioning more efficiently than they had before. The increased responsibilities and authorities of each Minister have allowed them greater flexibility to address and resolve issues as they arise.\n\nUnder the central guidance of the Reichskanzler, there now stands a truly modern government, one that is appropriate and capable to meet the challenges of the age Germany finds itself in. The inefficiencies and failures of the previous archaic system have been swept away. The future is here, and the Empire is well-prepared to meet it."
krg_ger.76.a: "Now, back to governing."

krg_ger.77.t: "Results of the Krosigkplan Trial"
krg_ger.77.d: "There was significant skepticism, and even outright opposition to von Krostigk's proposals to reform the Bundesrat. Despite contention, a compromise was agreed to which would implement his ideas on a small scale, which would demonstrate their validity - or lack thereof. Both supporter and skeptic alike eagerly awaited the results as the Krosigkplan Trial, as it was called, began.\n\nDue to the limitations of the trial, there was no definitively conclusion - but the Trial clearly demonstrated that the ideas had merit, and were not only feasible - but also demonstrating results. In comparison to other elements of the Bundesrat, those under Krosigk's trial were notably more efficient, and personnel able to achieve more with fewer resources.\n\nWhile there remain some questions as to how well this can be applied to the entire Bundesrat system, even the skeptics were won over by the results. The data did not lie, and there was more than enough evidence to hold additional trials - and later, if they are also successful, full implementation."
krg_ger.77.a: "Perfect."

krg_ger.78.t: "Implementing the Friedensgesetz Protocols"
krg_ger.78.d: "Security was on the forefront of the minds of most government and security officials following the Köln Riots, with near-universal pressure upon them to take decisive action against those who would undermine the security of the Empire. It was because of this that the Friedensgesetz Protocols - or the 'Peace Law' - were authorized by the Reichskanzler - effective immediately.\n\nThe Friedensgesetz Protocols had a singular purpose - to enable the German security apparatus to secure the Empire through an expanded array of tools and options. Restrictions that had previously been placed on security forces were loosened, or lifted entirely. Requirements for warrants were eased, and officers had the ability to at detain anyone suspected of subversive behavior.\n\nGerman security officers fanned out across cities across the Empire, newly empowered and single-minded in their determination to find the remnants of Syndicalist traitors and their sympathizers. The hunt has begun for all enemies of Germany, and there is one sentiment on the lips of every soldier, official, and minister."
krg_ger.78.a: "Never Another Köln."

krg_ger.79.t: "SPD Rally Suppressed"
krg_ger.79.d: "Despite the crackdowns taking place across the Empire, there were still groups who - bravely or foolishly - believe it necessary to express their views and opposition to the growing repression. The SPD had, to varying degrees, vocalized their opposition to the heavy-handed response to the Riots, along with the subsequent Friedensgesetz Protocols.\n\nIn Berlin a small group of SPD supporters gathered, condemning the enactment of the Protocols, and accusing the Reichskanzler of enabling the abuse of German citizens. The gathering, despite its small size, had many of the hallmarks of a rally, something the SPD had held many times before.\n\nBut times were different now. Their affiliation with the SPD did not protect them as officers arrived to shut the gathering down. One by one the agitators were detained, and those who were left fled as more officers approached. Within an hour, the short-lived rally was decisively dealt with, and an example set that few seem willing to repeat."
krg_ger.79.a: "Another step in the right direction."

krg_ger.80.t: "Wirth Rally Suppressed"
krg_ger.80.d: "Joseph Wirth was not an unfamiliar name to the German government. He was a vocal figure, and openly opposed to the Reichskanzler. Firmly within the left-wing of the Zentrum, he was nonetheless charismatic, and popular with many people across the political spectrum - despite his rumored socialist beliefs.\n\nIt was likely that Wirth believed that his position and popularity would allow him to hold a rally of his own without consequence - an assumption proved incorrect. He had barely begun his rally before German officers arrived, and quickly detained several attendees, along with Wirth himself, who was released shortly afterwards.\n\nDespite the shortness of his detention, the arrest of Wirth prompted anger among the locals and his supporters. His colleagues in the Zentrum also decried his treatment, and the suppression of the rally. Their words fell on deaf ears, as the objective had been achieved, and another den of Syndalicist sympathizers scattered."
krg_ger.80.a: "What? We're purifying the 'Centrists'."

krg_ger.81.t: "Accusations of Unfair Treatment"
krg_ger.81.d: "Criticism against the Friedensgesetz Protocols has not abated as time has passed, and with every day that they remain in force, the number of complaints continues to grow. The SPD has continued to be the most vocal, claiming that their members have been singled out for investigation, searches, or even had threats directed at them.\n\nThey claim that they are being subject to a coordinated intimidation campaign against not just themselves, but their friends and families. They have also accused officers of double standards, accusing them of manufacturing reasons to harass, while actual perpetrators have been ignored or released.\n\nWhile this is almost certainly an attempt to justify opposition against the Peace Law, there have been enough reports that it may be worth reminding the officers to be responsible with their authorities. On the other hand, given the damage the Riots caused, it is perhaps understandable that the officers are taking no chances."
krg_ger.81.a: "The Peace Law must be applied uniformly, if it's to be used at all."
krg_ger.81.b: "Ignore the socialist moaning, it's for the greater good."

krg_ger.82.t: "Socialist Smear Campaign Resumes"
krg_ger.82.d: "One of the most potent tools that those opposed to our actions is unity. Right now, there are many in the Reichstag who are unified in their opposition against us. When they speak with singular focus, it elevates them beyond what they otherwise would have been, and risks the public choosing to take them more seriously.\n\nTheir actions threaten our ability to properly ensure Germany's security and prosperity, and must be dealt with. An operation has been authorized, focusing on tarnishing and undermining this unity. With our political allies and the press under our control, we will release details against members to ruin their reputations, and make them impossible to be publicly associated with.\n\nRumors, scandals, every piece of information we can gather will be used against them. So long as it is not attributable to us, anything is on the table, regardless of truth. All that matters is that the united of this socialist vanguard breaks, and the public ignores their words, if not turns against them completely."
krg_ger.82.a: "Public perception is a powerful weapon."

krg_ger.83.t: "Witchhunts against Socialist Officials"
krg_ger.83.d: "Our efforts to turn the public against the socialist sympathizers within our government have had an effect that we didn't anticipate. Some German citizens have begun taking action into their own hands against the perceived \"Syndicalist traitors.\"\n\nThere are several reports of groups of these self-organized activists following and assaulting known left-wing politicians, sending several to the hospital with severe physical injuries. While these politicians are our political enemies, we have no evidence that they are actually Syndicalists, or hold such sympathies, and if left to continue, it is likely that one of these attacks will be fatal.\n\nThis campaign has had consequences beyond anticipated. We can make it clear that this kind of conduct is unacceptable, and take action against these self-appointed vigilantes. Alternatively, we can add them to our arsenal of options, and let them continue - while giving some guidance and direction when appropriate."
krg_ger.83.a: "That's too far even for us, detain the thugs."
krg_ger.83.b: "Subtly encourage the activists."

krg_ger.84.t: "Meeting with Erdmann"
krg_ger.84.d: "Organized labour is one of the most vulnerable parts of many societies, and Germany is unfortunately not an exception. It is through organized labour that Syndicalism is able to successfully infiltrate and subvert by making promises, and offering power to trade unions across the world. Unions were the heart of Syndicalism, and labor the lifeblood.\n\nHowever, labour is not doomed to Syndicalism, but it must be confronted. The best way to protect Germany against this threat is by inoculation. By cultivating a loyal labour movement we can eliminate the appeals and lies of Syndicalism, and remove the easiest vector from which they can threaten us.\n\nThis will require resources and time, and it begins by investing in and cultivating a relationship with the DNAP, a minor political party who has connections to many trade unions, and whose leadership is friendly to us. They will almost certainly be appreciative of the funding - and will understand that so long as they ensure the loyalty of the working man, they will continue to be supported by the Empire."
krg_ger.84.a: "Well, at least some Trade Unionists believe in our cause."

krg_ger.85.t: "The [GetYear] DNAP Conference"
krg_ger.85.d: "Because of our efforts to fund the DNAP, along with cultivating allies among organized labour, we received dividends in the form of this year's DNAP conference where both party and labour leaders made clear their support for the Empire, and extolled the efforts and support of the state for the common working man.\n\nNot only was Syndicalism and other socialist strains absent, they were actively condemned as lies to lead the working man astray. Empire, Fatherland, Kaiser, these were the words repeatedly spoken to the cheers of those in attendance.\n\nWhile doubtless not all of organized labor is convinced, or even supportive of us, it is clear that a majority have been won over. We have almost certainly blunted any Syndicalist efforts to turn our people against us - and taken another decisive step on ensuring our total victory over those who would plot against us."
krg_ger.85.a: "A defeat for Marxism, a victory for the Einheitsfront."

krg_ger.86.t: "DNAP Membership Grows"
krg_ger.86.d: "Because of the recent attention, investment, and expansion of the DNAP, the German public has taken notice.\n\nThe results of the DNAP's work have borne fruit. Following their successful party conference, their numbers have swelled by several factors. It is not surprising this has happened. For the first time, the common, honest, and loyal German working man has a party that properly represents him. Now German labour has representation that does not associate themselves with Syndicalists, socialists, and the left wing.\n\nBased on the pace of their growth, the DNAP is currently on track to put up a strong showing in the coming elections - and if we are fortunate, weaken the SPD in the process. Though their sudden rise has doubtless gained them new attention - and we can expect other parties to take notice and react."
krg_ger.86.a: "Further weakening the Socialists."

krg_ger.87.t: "SPD Denounces the DNAP"
krg_ger.87.d: "The rise of the DNAP has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the Reichstag, chief among them the SPD.\n\nThe SPD released a strong denouncement of the DNAP, attempting to paint the DNAP as pawns of the Reichskanzler, controlled by the government, and who feign their support for common labour causes and interests. They've fixated on several senior members of the DNAP whose rhetoric or actions have not matched their actions in an attempt to delegitimize the DNAP in the eyes of the people.\n\nWhile this is undoubtedly a smear campaign by the SPD against a perceived rival, it has had the effect they decided. The DNAP scrambled to preserve their image and credentials, while simultaneously denying the accusations. It can be expected that the SPD will be working hard to undermine the DNAP moving forward, and their institutional strength compared to the DNAP will give them an advantage if not properly accounted for."
krg_ger.87.a: "Irritating, the Socialists are getting smarter."

krg_ger.88.t: "The GGB Splits"
krg_ger.88.d: "The Gewerkschaftsbund has served as the umbrella organization for labor for many years, supported and maintained by the DNEF, and by extension, the state. It has done well in keeping a significant portion of trade unions under control - though this has not stopped smaller, more independent, and SPD-backed trade unions from growing as well.\n\nIt is time that this be changed, else it risks a larger alliance or movement of trade unions growing that is outside our control. We will begin taking steps to both solidify the Gewerkschaftsbund as the premier alliance of trade unions - along with making sure that those outside the Gewerkschaftsbund are hampered.\n\nThis need not be overt yet. We will employ regulations, fines, and other pressures brought to bear by the state against these smaller trade unions, many of whom lack the resources or unity to withstand these pressures. With a little time and sustained pressure, these independent or rival trade unions will either disband, or join the Gewerkschaftsbund. Regardless, any political threat that they pose will be reduced - and therefore strengthen our hold over organized labor as a whole."
krg_ger.88.a: "Let them fight amongst themselves."

krg_ger.89.t: "Elimination of the KAPD"
krg_ger.89.d: "The Communist Workers Party of Germany, known primarily as the KAPD, had never gained much support among the public, and as the notoriety of the Syndicalist movement grew, even fewer associated with them. Shunned by the SPD and every other left-leaning group, the only reason people believed they hadn't been outlawed was because of their irrelevance.\n\nA grace period that came to a sudden, quiet end.\n\nFollowing the arrest of several key members of the KAPD for illegal activities and Syndicalist sympathies, the remaining leading members formally dissolved the party, ending Germany's last communist party. In their statement, they claimed that to continue the party would only put their lives and livelihoods at risk.\n\nHowever, few heard their words and they passed without notice with not even many newspapers recording the news. Nonetheless, the end of the KAPD signals yet another death knell for Syndicalist influence in Germany."
krg_ger.89.a: "An occasion worthy of national celebration."

krg_ger.90.t: "Extending the Smear Campaign?"
krg_ger.90.d: "The current propaganda operations against the SPD and the left-wing have proven their effectiveness, and sharply blunted the appeal of those who are sympathetic to the Syndicalist cause to the public.\n\nThis success has prompted a proposal by security officials aimed at ensuring that the gains from this shift in public opinion are solidified by expanding the range of targets - specifically among the liberal parties. This would ideally force a divide within the largest liberal party, perhaps even causing a split within the party.\n\nThe proposal has been met with significant uncertainty, as while there are some clear benefits, the drawbacks are just as clear. There have been times where liberals have been willing to support our agenda. Many are also firmly anti-Syndicalist, even if they maintain some progressive views on certain economic and social issues. Tarnishing their reputations might not just risk unrest among the public, but hurt our own agenda. However, many socialists and Syndicalists were also once liberals. Perhaps the solution is to remove the weed at its roots."
krg_ger.90.a: "Targeting liberals could be counter-productive to our aims."
krg_ger.90.b: "Brand the so-called 'Progressives' Syndicalist-enablers!"

krg_ger.91.t: "Formation of the Deutsche Staatspartei"
krg_ger.91.d: "The results of expanding our campaign against the liberal parties have been more effective than we anticipated. Earlier in the day, five members from both the left and right wings of the LVP announced their resignation from the party, and the formation of a new party - the Deutsche Staatspartei.\n\nThey stated that this decision was necessary as they no longer believed that the LVP had the best interests of the people in mind, while hinting their doubts of their loyalty to Germany and the Kaisar.\n\nThey have already reached out to the DNEF to formally join our coalition. Negotiations are currently taking place, but each side expects they will announce their alliance shortly. This would mark the first instance of a liberal-leaning party firmly joining us, which further strengthens our hold over the Reichstag - and with our supporting, we can help them siphon even more of the liberal vote."
krg_ger.91.a: "Lets see if they can take root."

krg_ger.92.t: "LVP Membership Levels Fall"
krg_ger.92.d: "Thrown into chaos by the defection of the Deutsche Staatspartei members, the consequences for the LVP following the sudden defection of several senior members has been stark and immediate. As they no longer held a monopoly on the liberal voting base, they have been forced to reckon with a mass exodus of voters whose support they've lost.\n\nThe hemorrhaging of the LVP has been worsened by the fact that they are dominated by infighting, internally casting blame at each other over what happened, which has resulted in uncertainty and indecisiveness at a time when it is needed most.\n\nWhile the LVP will almost certainly stabilize itself in time, their grip over Germany's liberals has been firmly broken, and a weakened LVP will only strengthen our control over the Reichstag - or give us leverage if we wish to pressure them in the future."
krg_ger.92.a: "It appears the Schleicher strategy still works wonders."

krg_ger.93.t: "Building Political Apprehension"
krg_ger.93.d: "With the date of the Reichszentralisierungsakt's final vote in the Reichstag fast approaching, the political situation is extremely tense. Though we should have the support we need to reform the nation in our image, Socialist adjitation has seen some delegates waivering in their support for the Reichskanzler. While protests grow in the more left-leaning regions of Germany, we nervously await the day of our absolution."
krg_ger.93.a: "The vote cant come soon enough."

krg_ger.94.t: "The Reichszentralisierungsakt Vote"
krg_ger.94.d: "There have been many reforms introduced which have fundamentally reshaped the nature of the German state over recent months, all of them culminate in one final step that will solidify and secure the future of the German Empire. All that is required is for the powers and responsibilities of the Reichskanzler to be formalized in law, legitimized by the Reichstag, and recognized by the Kaiser.\n\nThe DNEF has introduced the Reichszentralisierungsakt to the Reichstag, legislation that would achieve this goal. A vote has been scheduled, and every side and interest is working to secure the votes, for they know that this will determine the future of Germany.\n\nWhile at one point there might have been a question of its passage, between our allies, assurances that have been given, and additional efforts to strengthen our position, the passage of this legislation is certain. There is nothing that can stop us now. All that remains is the vote, and Germany's future is secured."
krg_ger.94.a: "And now we wait..."

krg_ger.95.t: "The Reichszentralisierungsakt Passes"
krg_ger.95.d: "While the outcome was known to us, every member of the government breathed a sigh of relief as the vote tally was read out, and affirmed the passage of the Reichszentralisierungsakt. With the approval of the Reichstag, it now goes to be approved by the Kaiser and brought into immediate effect.\n\nIn a speech following the vote, Reichskanzler Bredow gave his thanks to the many allies across the German Empire for this momentous occasion, and reiterated that under his leadership, the German Empire had been transformed from its old ways into a superpower that will ensure German supremacy and prosperity in Europe, and across the world.\n\nRegardless of where one stands on the Reichskanzler, none can deny that Bredow has changed the Empire forever. The only questions that remain are what the empowered Reichskanzler does next - and how the world will react to the news."
krg_ger.95.a: "Let's toast to a new Germany!"

krg_ger.96.t: "Socialist Outrage Continues"
krg_ger.96.d: "Not everyone accepted the passage of the Reichszentralisierungsakt without protest. While the opposition established parties were restrained in their response, primarily expressing their disappointment, many individual members and a mixture of social democrats, socialists, and even liberals took to the streets in protest of what they perceived as a legitimized dictatorship.\n\nMany of these protests appear to be spontaneous and disorganized. They are appearing in cities across Germany, growing to sizes that haven't been seen in years. Police units are closely monitoring the situation, and several security officials are advising that the Peace Law be immediately invoked before these protests descend into riots.\n\nThere are even some reports of Syndicalist infiltrators and provocateurs in the crowds, though these have not been confirmed. For now, violence has not broken out, and several advisors suggest letting the protests continue and dissipate of their own accord, though there is no guarantee that they will remain peaceful forever."
krg_ger.96.a: "Supervise the protests, but let them get it out of their system."
krg_ger.96.b: "Enforce the Friedensgesetz Protocols, keep the peace!"

krg_ger.97.t: "Rumours of New Paramilitaries"
krg_ger.97.d: "As a response to the continued centralization of the government and its imposed policies, there have been reports of a paramilitary that is calling itself the Eiserne Front. The Verpo have opened an investigation to determine the threat this paramilitary could pose.\n\nThe Eiserne Front is believed to be primarily comprised of a mixture of militant social democrats, trade unionists, and other left-wing individuals. Their stated aims are to contest what they see as an authoritarian, dictatorial state forming. It is unclear how large the Eiserne Front is, but there are indications of a more organized group than traditional opposition groups.\n\nQuestions have been raised about potential Syndicalist connections, but proof remains elusive, as the group is presently keeping a low profile. This may only be a small cell of radicals, or it may be more sophisticated and dangerous than they present themselves. A decision must be made if the Verpo continues its investigation or not."
krg_ger.97.a: "They're just a small cell, not worth the resources."
krg_ger.97.b: "Have the Verpo expand the investigation."

krg_ger.98.t: "The Verpo's Investigation Concludes"
krg_ger.98.d: "Following a major operation against the so-called Eiserne Front, numerous members of the paramilitary were successfully detained by Verpo operatives. In total a dozen members were arrested, interrogations subsequently conducted.\n\nThe captured militants refused to willingly cooperate, and even under sustained interrogation did not reveal many new details about the inner workings of their organization, and insist they were the only members. Verpo interrogators speculated that these members may not have been fully initiated, or that the size of the Eiserne Front was much smaller than believed.\n\nDirect Syndicalist support was unable to be confirmed, even if the members confessed to varying degrees of Syndialist sympathies. There was nothing in their personal belongings that indicated additional members or contact with outside groups. With no more leads, the Verpo have elected to close the case, and turn over the members for prosecution."
krg_ger.98.a: "It's good they've been caught, but shouldn't there be more of them?"

krg_ger.99.t: "The Kaiser Congratulates the Reichskanzler"
krg_ger.99.d: "His Imperial Majesty has personally thanked the Reichskanzer for the work they've achieved in protecting the German Empire from domestic threats. He is said to be very pleased with the direction that the Reichskanzer is taking the nation."
krg_ger.99.a: "Gott Mitt Uns!"

krg_ger.100.t: "Neurath Returns to Germany"
krg_ger.100.d: "After a short Oxford Conference, wherein the British accepted our demands following fruitful negotiations, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath has returned to Germany, with the Kronprinz in tow.\n\nNeurath, whose diplomatic might was instrumental in our final victory against the British, has received a hero's welcome. He's expected to be awarded the Pour le Mérite for his efforts in strengthening the German nation. While not every outcome was in our favour, the Kaiser is still satisfied he has done his work."
krg_ger.100.a: "Welcome Back Sir."

krg_ger.101.t: "Neurath Returns to Germany"
krg_ger.101.d: "After a fruitful Oxford Conference, wherein the British accepted our demands, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath has returned to Germany, with the Kronprinz in tow.\n\nNeurath, whose diplomatic might was instrumental in our final victory against the British, has received a hero's welcome. He's expected to be awarded the Pour le Mérite for his efforts in strengthening the German nation and keeping the British nest of syndicalist vipers firmly under the German heel."
krg_ger.101.a: "Welcome Back Sir."

krg_ger.102.t: "Neurath Returns to Germany"
krg_ger.102.d: "After a tense Oxford Conference, wherein the British ended up utterly capitulating to our demands, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath has returned to Germany, with the Kronprinz in tow.\n\nNeurath, whose diplomatic might was instrumental in our final victory against the British, has received a hero's welcome. He's expected to be awarded the Pour le Mérite for his efforts in strengthening the German nation. There are concerns in some corners that the harshness of the terms received will only embitter the British against us and push them deep into the Accordist camp, but others state they will never willingly cooperate with Germany anyway so extracting the best terms is the most sensible course of action."
krg_ger.102.a: "Welcome Back Sir."

krg_ger.103.t: "Neurath Returns to Germany"
krg_ger.103.d: "After an extremely tense Oxford Conference, wherein the new peace of Europe almost fell apart, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath has returned to Germany, with the Kronprinz in tow.\n\nNeurath, whose diplomatic tact was instrumental in ensuring the lasting peace, has received a hero's welcome. He's expected to be awarded the Pour le Mérite for his efforts in strengthening the German nation. A few have muttered behind closed doors that the diplomat sprung more traps than he avoided, and there are murmurings about just how long he is going to enjoy the job."
krg_ger.103.a: "Welcome Back Sir."

krg_ger.104.t: "Konstantin von Neurath Retires"
krg_ger.104.d: "Having successfully secured favorable terms for the empire in the Treaty of Oxford, Konstantin von Neurath has decided to end his career in diplomacy on a high note and retire to his ancestral estate in Enzweihingen.\n\nTwo candidates have been suggested to replace Neurath as head of the Auswärtiges Amt. The first is Erwin Ettel, a navy veteran and the military's preferred choice. Alternatively there is Ernst von Weizsäcker, the current ambassador to the Holy See and favorite of the Conservatives."
krg_ger.104.a: "Appoint Erwin Ettel, the Military's Man."
krg_ger.104.b: "Appoint Ulrich von Hassell, the Veteran Diplomat."
krg_ger.104.c: "Appoint Ernst von Weizsäcker, the Conservative's Choice."

krg_ger.105.t: "Militarists Staff the Foreign Ministry"
krg_ger.105.d: "With the appointment of Erwin Ettel, the foreign ministry has undergone a spring-cleaning with a number of ranking civil servants being offered generous pensions or being pushed into other offices of government, while a number of veterans and former officers of the Weltkrieg have setup shop in the place.\n\nThere is no doubt that the connection between the General Staff and the Foreign Ministry will be much closer than it has been previously given the venn diagram of the personal networks the two groups move in are closer to a circle than they have been in a while."
krg_ger.105.a: "Jingoists in the Foreign Ministry? Business as Usual."

krg_ger.106.t: "Bureaucrats Staff the Foreign Ministry"
krg_ger.106.d: "With the appointment of Ulrich von Hassell, the foreign ministry has seen more DNEF men and technocrats coming in from the civil service and other paths of life, while more experienced diplomats and their assistants have taken their pensions or transferred to other government branches.\n\nWith the change in staff, the Kaiser's voice is more directly expressed through the foreign ministry than it has been in years. Hopefully this will not lead to any distress on the global diplomatic scene, but rather a new brash confidence that will remind the world that Germany is a mighty nation, and the founding member of the Nuclear Club."
krg_ger.106.a: "Consolidating our control? Good Work von Hassell."

krg_ger.107.t: "Conservatives Staff the Foreign Ministry"
krg_ger.107.d: "With the appointment of Ernst von Weizsäcker to the foreign office there has been a moderate flow of civil servants to and from other departments as those conservative minded gentlemen who still work in the government have sought to gain a transfer to the ministry.\n\nMost of the more experienced staff have remained in place however, which has meant that there is very little to be concerned about, aside from the question of exactly how loyal they are to the DNEF and the Kaiser's will."
krg_ger.107.a: "I'm sure they're very skilled, but do they actually support us?"

krg_ger.108.t: "The Moderate Parties Comply"
krg_ger.108.d: "Our efforts to consolidate our control of the Reichstag advance. Earlier this afternoon, senior DNEF leaders held a joint press conference with the leaders of several smaller liberal parties along with the lone agrarian party, announcing their admission to the governing DNEF-led coalition.\n\nThe news has been met with strong support from the Reichskanzler, and the allies of the DNEF coalition. Reactions from the membership of the parties in question was more mixed, with several members noting that they seemed to have received very little from the DNEF in exchange for their support.\n\nIt is possible that this will further fragment the liberal voting bloc as their voting bases shift to different candidates following their choice, but the consequences will only be felt in the next election. The DNEF's hold over the Reichstag has been strengthened, and these liberal parties are well-positioned to be displaced in future elections."
krg_ger.108.a: "Another domino falls."

krg_ger.109.t: "Conservatives Join the DNEF"
krg_ger.109.d: "The German Conservative Party recently concluded their internal leadership elections, which resulted in Hans Schlange-Schöningen being elected as their new chairman, along with a majority of his right-wing allies, successfully pushing out the moderate wing of the party. While the announcement was presented with fanfare to the public, internally the results have been strongly contested.\n\nThe moderate wing of the DkP, led by Robert Lehr, has accused the leadership vote of having been rigged, with members having sold out to the DNEF. While the accusations have been strongly denied by Schlange-Schöningen and his allies, few of Lehr's supporters believe him.\n\nSchlange-Schöningen's decision to announce his intention to support the DNEF, and entered into negotiations to formally join the ruling coalition, has only added to the outrage of the moderates whose anger threatens to completely split the party. Dispute the fury, it remains to be seen what, if anything, may be done by the moderates in response."
krg_ger.109.a: "Not very subtle, is he."

krg_ger.110.t: "DkP in Internal Disarray"
krg_ger.110.d: "After the hardline conservatives jumped ship to the DNEF, the DkP has been left as a recalcitrant rump of its former political strength.\n\nFollowing his failure to keep the party together against the predations and allure of the DNEF, DkP leader Carl von Goerdeler has resigned in shame. Leaderless and weakened, the DkP looks to be heading to the political graveyard as an idea whose time has come and gone."
krg_ger.110.a: "Sic transit gloria mundi"

krg_ger.111.t: "A New Face of the Conservatives"
krg_ger.111.d: "In an emergency leadership election, moderate-conservative deputy Robert Lehr has been appointed leader of the DkP.\n\nLehr has promised to reinvigorate the German Conservative movement following the Einheitsfront's bastardisation of it. This is an ironic stance to take given the records of the vote in the Reichstag show that Lehr did vote for the Zentralisierungsakt. It is clear however that the remaining Conservatives won't happily be sidelined by the Government, and will seek to put a thorn in our side as they oppose our agenda, in the vain hope that they can differentiate themselves enough to actually capture a vote or two."
krg_ger.111.a: "Lets see if Lehr actually bothers us."

krg_ger.112.t: "The Formation of the PDP"
krg_ger.112.d: "As many expected following the seizure of the DkP party leadership by the right-wing, Robert Lehr, together with many members of the moderate wing of the DkP, announced their departure from the party, and the formation of a new one - the Liberal Conservative Party of German Patriots.\n\nThe announcement prompted reactions across the political spectrum, most immediately impacting the DkP. Many of the moderate members of the DkP followed Lehr, causing DkP membership to plummet. The SPD and other liberal parties are attempting to appeal to these voters, while acknowledging that many of them will almost certainly flock to Lehr's new party.\n\nIf Lehr's party will have any success remains to be seen, as between the moderate and liberal parties working to peel off voters from an already limited membership pool, electoral success is not a guarantee. Nonetheless, the move has shaken up the political scene, and greatly damaged the current influence and future prospects of the DkP."
krg_ger.112.a: "Patriots? Those misguided politicians are the opposite!"

krg_ger.113.t: "The Zentrum Splits"
krg_ger.113.d: "With the political revolution following the Zentralisierung, Franz von Papen has taken the initative and has abandoned the ailing Zentrumspartei with his Rightist faction in tow."
krg_ger.113.a: "Welcome to the fold, Herr Papen."

krg_ger.114.t: "An Emergency Zentrumspartei Conference"
krg_ger.114.d: "Following the introduction of the Centralizing Act being, the Zentrum called all of their members for an emergency meeting to determine how they will vote. The meeting lasted for multiple hours, and was reportedly heavily contentious, with the various wings of the Zentrum in disagreement as to their approach.\n\nThe heated debate was almost certainly driven by the fact that the Zentrum knows that there is far more on the line than just a single vote, and the arguments differ between principle, pragmatism, and self-preservation as a consequence. Press coverage suggests that there is a strong possibility that the Zentrum will not vote as a united party, but instead on the basis of their internal divisions.\n\nUntil the vote is called, and the members cast their votes, there is little more that can be done except speculate."
krg_ger.114.a: "Let's hope they make the right choice."

krg_ger.115.t: "Adam Stegerwald is Ousted!" 
krg_ger.115.d: "Adam Stegerwald was a name that many in German politics were familiar with, as the former Secretary of Labour, and Chairman of the Centre Party. While he had a cordial relationship with the DNEF, he was not one of them - a fact that did not save him from a recent decision by his own party.\n\nIn a unanimous vote, the party leadership took an unprecedented step of expelling Stegerwald, citing his sympathies for the DNEF, and his previous associations and connections with Schleicher. Stegerwald attempted to resist this ousting, but failed.\n\nThis has sent ripples across the German political opposition, as it reflects the opposition parties taking a harder line against even association with the DNEF because of their policies. While it sends a clear message to the ruling party, some speculate that it may risk driving more people into the arms of the DNEF who otherwise might not have."
krg_ger.115.a: "We will always reward the loyal patriots of Germany."

krg_ger.116.t: "Leadership Election in the Zentrum"
krg_ger.116.d: "In the wake of a larger political realignment, in the Reichstag, the future direction of the Zentrum was to be determined with leadership elections which all of the factions competed for within the membership.\n\nThe brief race was highly competitive, but the victor was soon announced by the Zentrum, and few were surprised that Joseph Wirth had emerged victorious by a healthy margin. The progressive had been the favorite, and even prior to the election had been assumed to be the most likely successor to the party.\n\nRepresenting the progressive faction of the Zentrum, and possessing a clear leadership mandate from the membership, the Zentrum appear poised to echo their new leader and take a more progressive stance on policies - provided that Wirth can rally the other Zentrum factions behind him. Today, Wirth is projecting a message of unity - time will tell if he is able to achieve the ambitions of his rhetoric."
krg_ger.116.a: "Congratulations Herr Wirth"

krg_ger.117.t: "The Collapse of the Liberal People's Party"
krg_ger.117.d: "The Liberal People's Party had suffered a schism over prior months that finally ended in the party's complete implosion. Following pressure from the DNEF to support their agenda, a matter which deeply split the LVP, both sides determined the differences were irreconcilable, and took the next logical step - the dissolution of the LVP.\n\nBoth the right and left factions of the LVP have split, and both have yet to make any announcements as to their respective next steps. Most observers and experts expect them to form their own parties where they can pursue their agendas independent of the other.\n\nObservers believe that this is a net benefit for the DNEF, as now the right wing of the former LVP has no hurdle to supporting them, and the left faction of the LVP has a weaker support base, along with now having to compete with other opposition liberal and left parties for support."
krg_ger.117.a: "Our influence grows, as our opponents weaken themselves."

krg_ger.118.t: "A Meeting of Prominent Liberals"
krg_ger.118.d: "While the right wing of the former LVP was quick to consolidate into a new party and align itself with the DNEF, the left wing has not emulated this speed. Instead, owing to their disadvantaged position, they have elected to pursue a more cautious strategy before making any major decisions.\n\nLeaders of the remaining left-liberal parties, beyond just the LVP, have recently invited a number of other moderate-to-left liberals, as well as known former SPD members to discuss their political futures. The meeting was covered by local media, with many believing that talks for a new major opposition party were being held.\n\nWith the collapse of the main liberal and social democratic parties, a vacuum has been opened for a new party to emerge as a major opposition party to the DNEF. As talks continue, many watch to see if it will materialize into something substantial."
krg_ger.118.a: "They cannot change anything, no matter how hard they try."

krg_ger.119.t: "The Founding of the German Democratic Party"
krg_ger.119.d: "Earlier local press ran several stories claiming that prominent liberal and former SPD politicians were going to make a major announcement. Many observers speculated that it would be announcing a new political party intended to become a new major opposition party.\n\nThis speculation proved to be accurate, as the German Democratic Party was announced, with leaders openly appealing to liberals and social democrats across Germany. Despite its appeal to the more left-wing demographic, the unveiled party platform appears to be primarily comprised of traditional liberal and moderate policies than ones championed by the SPD.\n\nHowever, with the lack of an alternative, there are few options for many SPD voters. While surviving SPD members are rallying behind the new party, it remains unknown if this will be enough to entice their voters - or if they can grow into a political force that can succeed against the dominant DNEF."
krg_ger.119.a: "Something to watch closely."

krg_ger.120.t: "A Report on the Moderates"
krg_ger.120.d: "With the rapid changes taking place within the political landscape of the Reichstag, not even the moderate parties are being spared the upheaval. Following Joseph Wirth taking control of the Zentrum, and the formation of both the PDP and DstP, the moderate parties of the Reichstag are similarly adapting to the realignments and changes.\n\nThere are confirmed reports that preliminary talks between some leaders and senior members of multiple moderate parties have taken place - though crucially we lack details on their purpose or how far they have advanced. It is likely that with the current political instability outside the DNEF, the moderates see an opportunity to make a play as the primary opposition party to the DNEF.\n\nRegardless of their actual intentions, the fact is that the moderates sense opportunity, and are almost certainly going to capitalize on it. It would be prudent to prepare for yet more upheaval in the Reichstag in the coming days and weeks."
krg_ger.120.a: "They're up to something..."

krg_ger.121.t: "A Meeting of 'Moderates'"
krg_ger.121.d: "Previously established observation of the moderate parties of the Reichstag following reports on preliminary coordination has confirmed concerns of more significant actions being taken by the moderate parties. A significant meeting was recently held in which leaders from nearly all major and minor moderate parties met.\n\nWhile we were unable to confirm if a solid course of action was determined, it is known that one of the agenda items concerned a major merger of the moderate parties into a major party to serve as the primary opposition to the DNEF - which they view as a viable option with the collapse of other left-wing and social democratic parties.\n\nWe do not know if they reached a final agreement, but it is almost certain that all of these parties will continue to coordinate, even if they do not formally merge. We should expect these conspiring parties to act as a unified bloc, and adjust our expectations and plans accordingly."
krg_ger.121.a: "Get the Verpo to maintain their surveillance."

krg_ger.122.t: "Concern from the Reichskanzler"
krg_ger.122.d: "Our report on the activities of the moderate parties has reached the desk of the Reichskanzler, who has expressed concern over this development. He was under the impression that significant opposition within the Reichstag should have been impossible. Instructions to immediately increase surveillance, along with the DNEF to reach out to some of the moderate parties to peel them off were given.\n\nThe Verpo dutifully executed these directions, expanding surveillance operations against leaders and senior members of moderate parties. They reiterated that they did not know if a decision had been made concerning the full unification of the moderate parties. The Reichskanzler has continued to express his displeasure with this development, and issued further direction that it be blunted as much as possible.\n\nHowever, until the moderates make a move, or are caught in explicit criminal activity, it will be difficult to take harsher measures lest it trigger significant public backlash. We are watching them closely, and will be able to react accordingly when they take actions of their own."
krg_ger.122.a: "We're keeping a close eye on the situation, sir."

krg_ger.123.t: "The Formation of the BfD"
krg_ger.123.d: "Rumors concerning the actions of the moderate parties have finally come to fruition. Before the Reichstag, moderate leaders of numerous parties held a press conference where they announced their merger into the Alliance for Germany party, comprising all moderate parties of note, and their intent to serve as a direct opposition to the DNEF.\n\nThe silver lining for the DNEF is that there are already clear factions within the BfD - even if they are united in their opposition to us. The party is composed of a liberal faction, a federalist faction, and a nationalist faction. The BfD appears to combine the remaining center-left and conservative opposition into a single political force.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how effective this party will be, it has quickly emerged as a credible alternative to the DNEF, and if they can enforce party discipline, it has the opportunity to significantly shake up politics in the Reichstag. While not as dangerously left as the SPD, they nonetheless could pose an issue if left unchecked."
krg_ger.123.a: "Troubling for us, but at least they're mostly conservatives."

krg_ger.124.t: "Forming a Grand Coalition"
krg_ger.124.d: "Following the formation of the BfD, many expected a response from the DNEF, and received one far more substantial than expected. Just as the BfD consolidated into a single bloc, the DNEF appears to have emulated that approach. Their first announcement was that the DNAP were invited to the DNEF coalition, though the details of the arrangement are unknown.\n\nThe DNEF also absorbed the smaller members of their coalition whose political alignment was already firm, but whose numbers were small. Smaller right-wing and nationalist parties were fully merged into the DNEF proper, which has increased their overall numbers, and is seen as a direct challenge to the BfD's own consolidation.\n\nThis 'Grand Coalition' of the DNEF is touted as a proper representation of the interests of the German people. In practice it is the DNEF intending to reassert their control over the Reichstag, and kneecap opposition from the start. While this is unlikely to deter the BfD, it signals that the DNEF is prepared to take major steps to retain their control - time will tell how successful they are."

krg_ger.298.t: "The Second Ruhr Boom"
krg_ger.298.d: "Following a flood of investment into projects within the Rhine-Rhur region, actual construction work has begun in earnest. Even over this initial period of time, it has already resulted in notable foundations that will ensure the future industrialization, urbanization, and prosperity of the region.\n\nMany experts and economists are watching the regional development with significant interest, and as initially projected, it is likely to exceed the First Rhur Boom in terms of economic output, industrialization, and positive benefits to the region and empire. It is a decision that many expect will benefit the Empire for decades to come.\n\nAdditionally, the Danubian Federation has also expressed interest in a proposal to build a canal connecting the Black Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Engineers are beginning to draw up plans for its actual construction. Such a massive project will take years to complete - but it's success would benefit both empires substantially, as well as tie us closer to our continental neighbor."
krg_ger.298.a: "This will help heal the scars of war."

krg_ger.299.t: "The end a period of explosive growth"
krg_ger.299.d: "Nearly a decade after the Second Ruhr Boom began, continued investment has substantially slowed, and the scale industrialization has begun to wind down as construction slows and projects were completed.\n\nThe Rhine-Rhur region stands transformed. It now stands as an industrial powerhouse, with economic power magnitudes higher compared to the pre-war and war eras. It's output has produced much for the empire, and we reap the benefits today, and will for decades to come.\n\nHowever, we knew the Boom could not last forever. Economic projections have been slowly but steadily falling with fewer investments and projects over the years, to now where the Boom has decidedly ended. However the impact of this period cannot be understated, and the overall effort is considered an overall major success. It stands as a model to be emulated in other regions, and serves as a success story of reconstruction and industrialization."

New streets paved, new homes and hospitals erected, new schools built, and there are children on the playgrounds. While the scars of the war will not fade for many, there is a new sense of normalcy and security for the first time in years. Finally, those who were forced to flee are now able to breathe.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Rhineland has progressed enough that the Rückkehrprogramm is considered a success. The money that the citizens paid into accounts for years has now been released for them to do as they wish. The trials were great, but here now stands an example of the resilience of the people of the Rhineland!"

krg_ger.400.t: "The Kaiser's Funeral"
krg_ger.400.d: "His Imperial Majesty, Wilhelm III, was laid to rest next to his father and grandfather at the Friedenskirche Mausoleum in Potsdam. Today's event was a somber one as rain and distant thunder hung over the procession. While not as beloved as his father, Wilhelm III nonetheless served as an important rallying symbol for his people during the darkest days of the Second Weltkrieg. This fact was demonstrated by the thousands of mourners who clogged the streets of Potsdam, all crowding together to get a final glimpse of the late kaiser. Dignitaries from around the world also came to pay their last respects. Notably absent was Edward VIII of the United Kingdom. Despite other senior members of the British royal family being in attendance, the restored King of England has chosen to thumb his nose at the Imperial family one last time. The two men, who were second cousins, held a deep hatred for one another that lasted the better part of three decades. One hopes that the new kaiser, Wilhelm IV, will be able to mend relations between the two royal houses. For now, such trifles can no longer burden a man who has had to carry the weight of the Reich upon his shoulders for ten long hard years."
krg_ger.400.a: "Rest now, Your Majesty."

krg_ger.401.t: "The Coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm IV"
krg_ger.401.d: "Perhaps to some foreigners it was surprising to hear that the coronation of the new German Kaiser was a small, private event. The Kronprinz wasn't even crowned as the Kaiser of the German Empire, rather the King of Prussia. But for the Germans, this is normal. Large, lavish coronations had always been seen as an excess, the royal family of Germany instead preferring small events, followed by a proclamation that the new Kaiser had ascended to rule the Empire.\n\nDespite the seemingly modest event, a day of celebration was declared across the Empire. Many of the more devout citizens took the time to hang German flags from their balconies, display the Hohenzollern coat of arms in their windows, or add a framed picture of the new Kaiser above their mantle."
krg_ger.401.a: "He's so handsome!"

krg_ger.402.t: "The Coronation Speech"
krg_ger.402.d: "Kaiser Wilhelm IV addressed the nation today, making an impassioned speech reiterating Germany's commitment to upholding order and peace in the world and the "burden of leadership" that has fallen upon Germany's shoulders. 'Today Germany stands indisputably atop the world order, as such it is our duty to lead by example. Our social programs are the best anyone can offer, despite our great and historic opposition to the red hydra. Our armies are by far the most effective fighting force in the world, even if they may not be the largest in absolute numbers. Our economy is the greatest in the world, thanks to the great industriousness and energy of every German citizen; past, present and future. My grandfather was a great man, a stickler for rules and tradition, yet he also knew when to break those same rules, which has allowed me to become the Kaiser before you today. And now I shall take this chance to announce two great changes, in recognition of the great contributions that women have made, both in wartime and peacetime the introduction of female suffrage and the abolition of agnatic primogeniture. Naturally this announcement has blindsided the predominantly conservative establishment, who are largely opposed to the said issues."
krg_ger.402.a: "Female what?"
krg_ger.402.b: "That wasn't in the script…"

krg_ger.403.t: "The Succession Question"
krg_ger.403.d: "Many historians have cited "Salic Law", the set of laws codified by the Franks in the 5th century, as one of the cornerstones of civil law in Western Europe. While Salic Law describes everything from procedural code, to a list of fines for different crimes, it also includes a clause in regard to female inheritance of royal titles. That law states, in plain text, that women cannot inherit land, titles, or Kingdoms.\n\nThis is a major issue for the new Kaiser, for he lacks a son. Instead, Wilhelm IV and his wife, Queen-Consort Dorothea, have two daughters. At the age of 45, it's very unlikely that he will have another child. So, as of this moment, it is impossible for Wilhelm's oldest daughter Felicitas to take the throne after his passing. For this reason, many in the government have speculated that the new Kaiser will attempt to amend the Salic Laws. More conservative monarchists are already outraged by such an idea, though the Kaiser has yet to speak publicly about any plans."
krg_ger.403.a: "Oh scheiße..."

krg_ger.404.t: "A Constitutional Crisis"
krg_ger.404.d: "Kaiser Wilhelm IV's coronation address has triggered widespread debate throughout Germany, with liberals hopeful that this will be the beginning of a new progressive era, while conservatives have largely been urging caution. However, things are not that simple. The office of Kaiser is legally bound to the office of the King of Prussia, as such any amendments to the Prussian succession law must first receive the consent of both the Reichstag and Bundesrat where an uphill task is expected."

krg_ger.405.t: "The Reichskanzler's concern"
krg_ger.405.d: "In a meeting with the cabinet today, Reichskanzler Bredow reiterated the DNEF's commitment to 'upholding German traditions', emphasizing the importance of maintaining the status quo to 'avoid a descent into liberal degeneracy'. "On principle the Kaiser's initiatives cannot be supported, but the alternative is at least equally bad due to Kronprinz Louis Ferdinand's rabid pacifism." This was what the Reichskanzler allegedly said to his private secretary after the meeting. The cabinet's official position however, is that the Kaiser's reforms will not be supported."
krg_ger.405.a: "The Kaiser certainly won't be pleased with that."

krg_ger.406.t: "The Reichskanzler falls ill"
krg_ger.406.d: "Earlier today, Reichskanzler von Bredow collapsed. He has been complaining to aides about shortness of breath and issues sleeping for weeks, but it appears his condition has become serious enough to require hospitalisation. Bredow is awake and in good spirits, and is expecting a diagnosis in the coming days."
krg_ger.406.a: "Let's hope for a speedy recovery."

krg_ger.407.t: "Bredow is released from hospital."
krg_ger.407.d: "Following a series of state-of-the-art tests on the stricken Reichskanzler, doctors have diagnosed Bredow with advanced Lung Cancer. Unexpectedly, Bredow has refused treatment for the disease, after doctors said removing his right lung would likely eradicate the cancer, as they've found no evidence of it having metastasized. In a meeting with the new Kaiser earlier, Bredow said "The time has come for me to join my Chief", referencing his mentor and former Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher. As such, the Reichskanzler has demanded he be released from hospital with painkillers, and has accepted the doctor's prognosis that he'll likely be dead within the next few months."

krg_ger.408.d: "Reichskanzler Bredow passed peacefully away in his sleep yesterday after a short battle with cancer. His opposition to the revocation of Salic Law was well-known, but out of respect for the close relationship the late Reichskanzler had with his father, the Kaiser decided against sacking him. Reichskanzler Bredow's state funeral will be held in two weeks, but now the Kaiser must appoint his successor."

krg_ger.409.d: "The funeral of Reichskanzler Ferdinand von Bredow was one which was treated and viewed with reverence not seen or acknowledged since the death of the late Kaiser Wilhelm II. State officials from current and previous administrations, family members, friends, and foreign dignitaries filled the rows of the somber church where the service was held, and the Reichskanzler laid to his final rest.\n\nThe funeral was filled with speeches from those who had known and worked with the Reichskanzler closely, each of whom spoke of the impact, character, and legacy of the man who had led in what would almost certainly be one of the most important periods in Germany's history.\n\nMany foreign dignitaries and heads of state from the Reichpakt and beyond also took part, giving their own respects, followed by lines of citizens whose numbers stretched across streets. The Kaiser is certain to formally approve a new Reichskanzler in the coming days, but for now Germany now pays their final respects - even as the Reichskanzler's many enemies quietly celebrate the death of a man who they called a tyrant."
krg_ger.409.a: "Rest in peace, Reichskanzler Bredow."

krg_ger.410.t: "The Reichskanzler's concern"
krg_ger.410.d: "In a meeting with the cabinet today, Reichskanzler Mackensen reiterated the DNEF's commitment to 'upholding German traditions', emphasizing the importance of maintaining the status quo to 'avoid a descent into liberal degeneracy', decisively rejecting both of the Kaiser's initiatives. "The wonderful German nation shall not bend to the corrupted ideals of liberalism and progressivism". When questioned about Kronprinz Louis Ferdinand's very public pacifist leanings, the official response was, "Pacifist or otherwise it does not matter since the Accord/Entente wishes to topple us with a burning passion. He will have to adapt his views to the global situation.""
krg_ger.410.a: "This definitely will end badly for someone..."

krg_ger.411.t: "The Kaiser is not pleased"
krg_ger.411.d: "Reichskanzler Mackensen's comments have triggered quite a storm with the Kaiser due to their highly disrespectful nature. The Kronprinz's views notwithstanding, he is still a member of the royal family and will not be subject to such disrespect, especially not from the Reichskanzler. The Kaiser will certainly look to dismiss the Reichskanzler as soon as an opportunity reveals itself, the only question now will be when the axe falls, and who will pick up the pieces in its aftermath."
krg_ger.411.a: "Perhaps his cabinet could topple him from within."
krg_ger.411.b: "We must revitalise the DNEF with new leadership."

krg_ger.412.t: "A change in leadership"
krg_ger.412.d: "Reichskanzler Mackensen's comments have proved to be indefensible, and it is becoming clear that the Kaiser is looking for a suitable replacement, preferably someone who is already a member of the cabinet. As of now there are two potential candidates, the Vizekanzler Eugen Ott or Interior Minister Herbert von Bose."
krg_ger.412.a: "Bose"
krg_ger.412.b: "Ott"

krg_ger.413.t: "Stirrings within the cabinet"
krg_ger.413.d: "The impending doom awaiting Mackensen has set off a frenzy of politicking among the cabinet as the Kaiser's intentions gradually became clear. In the aftermath of having a chancellor who is "too powerful for his own good", the Kaiser is balking at appointing another retired general to the post, instead looking for a veteran career politician to take up the role, one which the seemingly unassuming Herbert von Bose is the sudden front-runner for."
krg_ger.413.a: "A surprising candidate for sure."

krg_ger.414.t: "Meeting with the stakeholders"
krg_ger.414.d: "With Reichskanzler Mackensen in an increasingly untenable position, Vizekanzler Eugen Ott is now well-placed to complete his comeback after being sidelined by former Reichskanzler Bredow in 1946. He has reportedly met with several important business leaders and other DNEF supporters to secure his path to the chancellorship. The Kaiser is also keen to appoint a successor who will not rock the boat, and Eugen Ott appears to be that man."
krg_ger.414.a: "Five years overdue but the time has finally come."

krg_ger.415.t: "The Shadow Reichskanzler"
krg_ger.415.d: "In the aftermath of Reichskanzler Mackensen's audacious conduct, it is clear that the Kaiser is determined to replace him with someone more suitable for the job, the person of choice being longtime confidant and friend Hans-Jurgen von Blumenthal. Things would not be so simple however, since Reichskanzler Mackensen enjoys significant popularity both among the populace and army, riding high from being the first person to successfully lead an invasion of Britain since 1066. While it is completely within the Kaiser's power to dismiss and appoint Reichskanzlers as he wishes, to do so immediately after ascending the throne in this way is bound to cause political instability."
krg_ger.415.a: "Let us bide our time."

krg_ger.416.t: "The Kaiser's Will Prevails"
krg_ger.416.d: "It was unsurprising that the now-former Reichskanzler Mackensen fell from grace after making an enemy of the Kaiser, and many awaited to see who would be appointed his replacement. The Kaiser's reluctance to appoint a former military officer led him to a candidate that few had been expecting - the Minister of the Interior Herbert von Bose.\n\nAn unassuming bureaucrat, Bose's administrative skills and many years in the government made him an appealing individual to hold the position, along with his seeming lack of political ambition or agenda. The Kaiser sees in him an ability to quickly adapt to his position with minimal issue, and return stability to the government.\n\nRegardless of the reasons for his selection, once the initial surprise faded, few saw much reason to question the decision. Most of the interest - and scrutiny - has fallen on the new Reichskanzler, what he will do, and what his vision for Germany - such as it is - will be."
krg_ger.416.a: "A fine choice by the Kaiser."

krg_ger.417.t: "The Kaiser's Will Prevails"
krg_ger.417.d: "While he was seen as a likely candidate to succeed the former, and now disgraced Reichskanzler Mackensen, the formal appointment of Vizekanzler Eugen Ott was seen as a definitive transition to a Reichskanzler that was decidedly more favorable to the interests of the Kaiser.\n\nThe former military officer had done the work necessary to secure broad support within the DNEF and business interests across Germany, as well as the Kaiser. His previous position as Vizekanzler has additionally given him a more detailed understanding of the rigors of the position than most.\n\nDespite the Kaiser's skepticism of promoting former military officers to greater positions of power, Ott is seen as a stabilizing force, and competent leader, who lacks significant political ambitions, which the Kaiser is more concerned with. If Ott can be this stabilizing force remains to be seen - but the choice is made, and Germany awaits the direction of the new Reichskanzler."
krg_ger.417.a: "A choice that is sure to bring stability."

krg_ger.418.t: "The Kaiser's will prevails"
krg_ger.418.d: "Faced with overwhelming opposition from all corners of Germany and decisively abandoned by all his former allies, Reichskanzler Mackensen finally capitulated to the Kaiser's demands and resigned from his position. His replacement Hans-Jurgen von Blumenthal's appointment comes as a surprise to no one, being a close personal friend of the young Kaiser, no doubt he will be able to further Wilhelm IV's great ambitions for Germany both at home and abroad."
krg_ger.418.a: "All is finally as it should be."

krg_ger.419.t: "The Reichskanzler's concern"

krg_ger.420.d: "Reichskanzler Popitz resigned quietly today after the Kaiser made clear in no uncertain terms that he would have to either agree to the proposed reforms or be removed from office. Faced with this unenviable dilemma, Reichskanzler Popitz chose to instead resign himself, opening the way for the Kaiser to appoint a chancellor that is more understanding of his vision."
krg_ger.420.a: "All is finally as it should be."

krg_ger.421.t: "The Reichskanzler's concern"
krg_ger.421.d: "In a meeting with the cabinet today, Reichskanzler Goerdeler was ambiguous in his support for the Kaiser's initiative. A staunch conservative, Goerdeler personally does not entirely agree with the revocation of Salic succession, but he is also wise enough to realize that opposing the Kaiser on this issue is a futile exercise, especially given the other issue of female suffrage being too powerful to reasonably oppose. The DkP cabinet seems to be receptive to the reforms and the potential political gains that could be made by being the party to legalize female suffrage."
krg_ger.421.a: "This looks promising…"
krg_ger.421.b: "But we must protect our great traditions!"

krg_ger.422.t: "Rapid rise, rapid fall"
krg_ger.422.d: "After his rejection of the Kaiser's proposed reforms, it came as no surprise that Reichskanzler Goerdeler was unceremoniously sacked from his office, with Graf Hans-Jurgen von Blumenthal appointed to be his replacement following a quiet internal shuffle within the DkP."
krg_ger.422.a: "What did Herr Goerdeler expect really?"

krg_ger.423.t: "The Reichskanzler's concern"
krg_ger.423.d: "The Coronation Speech has been met with great enthusiasm from Reichskanzler [GER.GETHeadOFGovernment] and his cabinet. The political gains that could be made from introducing female suffrage are massive, not to mention probably long overdue. The Reichskanzler has placed these issues at the top of the government agenda, which certainly will please all the parties involved, especially the prospective new voters, whose support we can count on in the next election."
krg_ger.423.a: "All is finally as it should be."

krg_ger.424.t: "The Salic Law Repealed"
krg_ger.424.d: "In an unprecedented event in recent German history, the laws of succession concerning the monarchy, which have historically derived from the Salic Law, have been altered in a landmark vote by the Bundsrat which has sent shockwaves through Germany for what this means for the future of the Monarchy.\n\nOnce stipulating clear lines and limitations of succession, the law was altered to state that the Crown of Germany and Prussia is to be passed down based on choice of the Kaiser alone - effectively allowing the Kaiser to handpick their successor, no matter their position in the family.\n\nWith the pressure that Kaiser Wilhelm IV exerted on the Reichskanzler to pass the law, and his lack of a suitable male heir, there is rampant speculation that Wilhelm IV intends for his daughter to succeed him - a choice that will doubtless cause controversy across Germany. Yet the law is passed, and the future of the monarchy is now in the Kaiser's hands."
krg_ger.424.a: "God protect the crown princess"

krg_ger.425.t: "Failure of the Women's Suffrage Act"
krg_ger.425.d: "The effort of feminist activism across Germany suffered a significant defeat, as the Reichstag failed to pass the Women's Suffrage Act. A combination of lobbying against the measure, political opposition, and administrative mishaps led to the bill failing to gain a majority of support.\n\nWomen across Germany have condemned the failure of the government to allow them what is increasingly seen as a fundamental right, opponents have leapt at the opportunity to paint the ruling party as incompetent, and the popularity of the government has suffered as a result. While there have been promises to reintroduce and pass the bill, skepticism has only risen among the public.\n\nIt can be expected that unless the government makes serious efforts to pass the bill, support from feminist activists and their allies will continue to fade as they look for alternatives. Some are willing to give the government another chance to pass the measure, but there will doubtless be an impact on the government’s popularity in the immediate future."

krg_ger.502.t: "Assuaging the Industrialists Fears"
krg_ger.502.d: "Concerns have been rising within our industrialist allies of recently-passed laws that require mandated party secretaries within corporate structures. These concerns primarily revolve around fears that this will be used as a tool of the state to interfere in business activities and decisions, which the industrialists have heavily opposed.\n\nBlumenthal has agreed to meet with them, though it is known what the industrial demands are - or at least those of our closest allies. At minimum they expect an exemption for the mandated secretaries, though are ambivalent on if we enforce this regulation on other corporate interests. There are two options that can be pursued.\n\nThe first is that we can agree to their primary demand, and develop exemptions for our industrialist allies, which will assuage their concerns, but weaken the impact of the broader law. Alternatively, we can stand our ground and force them to make a choice on their support - but they as well as we know their options are limited."

krg_ger.503.d: "The choices made by Schliecher and Bredow in previous years could be charitably described as a failure as they concerned the agrarian sector - though the German Agrarian League would doubtless employ stronger language.\n\nThe BdL is willing to meet and provide their support to our administration - contingent on if they are convinced that our administration will be able to correct these failings in a way they are satisfied with. Their demands involve investments, subsidies, and tax breaks - all resulting in a notable degree of favoritism from the German state.\n\nThe support of the BdL could be significant, and meeting at least some of the demands is possible - though other allies may take issue with the resulting favoritism. Alternatively, we can provide them some support, but refuse their larger demands, though this will likely cost us their support."
krg_ger.503.a: "Let's get them on our side."
krg_ger.503.b: "They will be happy with what we give them, or they can walk."

krg_ger.504.t: "Securing the OHL's Support"
krg_ger.504.d: "An uncomfortable reality is that, in many instances, one institution that holds significant power is the military. The support of the military is critical for a stable and secure administration - but one that can quickly become dangerous if handled improperly. Like it or not, the OHL is one such group that we must gain the support of.\n\nWhile in theory their support is not needed, their connections and support can secure what we need for our administration. Alternatively, it could significantly worsen the situation. Prior to our meeting with the German High Command, it is almost certain that they will expect that, in return for their support, they are owed a certain amount of control over decisions pertaining to the military - as well as disproportionate budgetary funding for the military.\n\nWe can accede to these demands and promise what they want, and will almost certainly secure the support we need. Alternatively, few are thrilled of the possibility of the OHL exerting such influence over the state, along with fears of a parallel military state developing based on this precedent."
krg_ger.504.a: "We need their support to succeed."
krg_ger.504.b: "We won't return to a rule of Generals!"

krg_ger.505.t: "DNEF Membership Mandated"
krg_ger.505.d: "Early in the day, notices were distributed to all government workers of the German state - requiring their immediate enrollment in the DNEF. They were subsequently required to present proof of their membership to their supervisor no later than one week after this notice.\n\nWhile party membership had been strongly encouraged by the administration, this is the first instance of it being mandated. There are no exemptions offered - those who have asked about the consequences if they do not comply were told that they would be immediately fired from their positions.\n\nAlready membership in the DNEF has spiked, as thousands of government workers comply with the new mandate, which is widely seen as a the DNEF securing a permanent hold over the state, and now that they have a foothold in the bureaucracy, it may make it impossible to dislodge."
krg_ger.505.a: "The iron hand closes tighter."

krg_ger.506.t: "Iron Front Grows Stronger"
krg_ger.506.d: "While the majority of government workers have complied with the mandate to join the DNEF, there are those who have refused - holdover liberals, left-wing sympathizers, and even some conservative opponents of the administration. Many of them resigned rather than be fired, and most have been seeking work elsewhere.\n\nHowever, another group has also grown along with the DNEF - the Eiserne Front. The numbers of this revolutionary group had slowly been growing as democrats were banned or suppressed by the state, and now there is a new batch of individuals who see increasingly few options with the heavy-handed approach of the administration.\n\nIt remains unknown if this will lead to any significant changes, or if any group can challenge the unassailable grip the DNEF holds over the state - but the rise of the Eiserne Front cannot be discounted. As the grip of the DNEF continues to tighten, many expect the Eiserne Front to grow in response."
krg_ger.506.a: "Fools and traitors."

krg_ger.507.t: "Civil Servants Join the DNEF"
krg_ger.507.d: "There had been a hope, for some even an expectation, that the changes would stop with mandatory membership in the DNEF. However, the most pessimistic were proven correct, as following the majority of civil servants complying with the mandate to join the ruling party, further changes were instituted in the bureaucracy.\n\nIt began with party officials attending meetings, often providing unsolicited direction or suggestions. These officials were then required to attend, and no longer observers, but given oversight authorities. No more were they giving suggestions, but orders to the rank and file. In only weeks it was clear the governing bodies of the state were fully controlled by the DNEF.\n\nLoyalty to the DNEF and its priorities quickly took precedence, and politics a driving force. Those who did not comply with what the party wanted or needed found themselves sidelined or removed. The shift has not been met without challenge - but as with the mandate, internal opposition appears limited at best."
krg_ger.507.a: "A necessary step for prosperity."

krg_ger.508.t: "DNE Entrenched in Regional Diets"
krg_ger.508.d: "Some small and isolated, but notable protests have broken out following the results of the regional elections, which saw the DNEF and aligned candidates sweep the diets in a decisive victory for the ruling party. Defeated candidates and some party officials have been quick to dispute these results, leveling accusations that include outright election fraud, and have demanded recounts or even election redos.\n\nThese protests have received minimal attention from the government, and the Justice Minister has declined to investigate, citing a lack of evidence. Several observers however note that the rate for DNEF candidates well-exceeded estimations, and the newly elected officials have already begun efforts to make opposing or undermining the federal government more difficult.\n\nThe DNEF has been concerned about another Nullification Crisis since assuming power, and with effective control over the regional diets, they are in a position to take steps to permanently rectify it - and that appears to be no more or less than their plan."

krg_ger.537.t: "The Perfection of Staatssozialismus"
krg_ger.537.d: "Many leaders of Germany have sought to unify the nation through various means, be they policies, force, or other incentives and pressures. As the First and Second Weltkriegs proved, a nation that is not united, in values, resilience, heritage, and history will be one that is ultimately destroyed.\n\nBecause of the efforts of Reickskanzler Blumenthal, these efforts to unify the German state and people have achieved a new level of success. The aftermath of the war, the horrors of Syndicalism, and the looming threat of the Entente has shown that a choice must be made - to unify under a single banner, or allow diversity to weaken the empire.\n\nIt is certain this is the first step in a process that will last generations - but the groundwork for such a nation, one resistant to the illusions and insurrectionalist ideologies of syndicalism and liberalism alike, has been laid. One day, the last gasps of those who seek to weaken the German spirit will finally be silent, and Germany can march without fear into the future."

krg_ger.538.t: "Lead Up to the Reichstagwahl"
krg_ger.538.d1: "The German elections approach, and it is expected that the DkP coalition will dominate the proceedings. With the DNEF's successful passage of the New State law as their crowning achievement, there is quiet resignation from other parties of their chances to dislodge the DNEF from power - though the Zentrum-LVP coalition intends to try.\n\nWhile the DkP members, and especially the DNEF, is expected to maintain or grow their seats, the opposing BfD is anticipated by observers to also see gains with the collapse of other opposition parties - reflected by enthusiasm and polling. However many are also aware that the BfD are seen as a threat, and it remains to be seen if the DkP will allow a free and fair election.\n\nMany are pessimistic as the election approaches, even within the BfD, though all parties intend to stand as many candidates as possible. Though before the first ballot is cast, it appears to be not a question of if the DkP wins - but how large their victory will be."
krg_ger.538.d2: "The German elections approach, and there is heightened interest throughout Germany as for the first time in years, the ruling DNEF and their allies are vulnerable. While the DkP remains one of the only two major forces in the election, the failure to pass the New State Law, and the subsequent leadership turnover have allowed the Zentrum to make a credible attempt at the chancellorship.\n\nWhile the DkP has stabilized under Reichskanzler Goerdeler, who has become a popular figure that conservatives across Germany have rallied behind, it is unclear if he will be able to galvanize and win over enough of the public to his side. The Zentrum have effectively capitalized on the stumbles of the DkP, which may be enough to lead them to victory.\n\nOne thing that is certain is that heading into this election season, no one knows for sure who will emerge the victor. The DNEF and their allies retain significant support despite their missteps, but experts are in agreement that the Zentrum have enough momentum and support to win. Regardless of the outcome, it is certain to be a fierce competition."

Despite attempts from their enemies to destroy them, or foreign ideologies to weaken them, Germany remained standing when the dust cleared.\n\nThere are many lessons that can be taken from the hegemon of Europe, and for many countries they are an example to aspire to. In a world that has ever-shifting alignments, it would be wise to take the lessons of those who are successful. Germany has presented a blueprint of success and endurance that is worth emulating.\n\nReichskanzler Blumental has encouraged German support and development for their allies, and been willing to work with partner nations throughout the Reichspakt to improve the capabilities of each nation. With the help of Germany, our state will become more organized, efficient, and capable of defending ourselves from any enemies."

With the party largely behind him, it is expected that the DkP will perform well, though internally they acknowledge some uncertainty due to the leadership changes, and public perceptions around the New State Law, even if it ultimately failed to pass.\n\nThe Zentrum-LVP coalition currently has no undisputed leader, but it is expected that should they succeed, they will be led by either Josef Wirth of the Erzbergian Progressives or Heinrich Brüning of the Rhenish Moderates. Two very different paths await Germany, and it is expected to be a fierce election season."

Prior to the elections, Reichskanzler Goerdeler made his intention to, upon electoral victory, step down and allow Robert Lehr to succeed him as Reichskanzler.\n\nHowever, there has been heavy pressure within the party for Goerdeler to remain as Reichskanzler, partially because of his wide popularity - but also because conservatives oppose ceding power to a liberal conservative like Lehr.\n\nThe choice is one that ultimately comes down to Goerdeler, and as a not-insignificant part of the party supports his continued service, he has seriously considered delaying his original plans and continuing to serve as Reichskanzler. After several days, the Reichskanzler announced to the DkP membership that…"

The second candidate is Josef Wirth, representing the Progressive caucus, and successor to Mattias Erzberger. The Progressives are known for their close alliance with the LVP,along with their opposition to interdenominationalism.\n\nAnother, though much smaller faction is Franz von Papen's Prussian coalition, who've primarily established themselves as oppositional obstructionists to the coalition, who are unlikely to do more than disrupt the proceedings.

Goerdeler now oversees the new mass conservative party, with a cabinet that reflects the spectrum of conservative membership.\n\nHeinrich von Brentano stands as Foreign Minister, and comes from the right-wing faction of the Zentrum, Johannes Popitz was selected as Economic Minister, Hans Koch as Justice Minister, while Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus was handpicked as the Interior Minister.\n\nDespite Goerdeler's historical dealings with Schliecher, he retains significant popularity within the party and wider public alike. It is clear that his mandate is secure, and with a cabinet and party fully behind him, time will soon tell if he will be able to achieve his ambitions, and shape a new vision for Germany."

His appointment was not without some apprehension due to his more liberal leanings, even as he has constructed a cabinet reflective of the conservative spectrum.\n\nHeinrich von Brentano stands as Foreign Minister, and comes from the right-wing faction of the Zentrum, Johannes Popitz was selected as Economic Minister, Hans Koch as Justice Minister, while Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus was handpicked as the Interior Minister.\n\nLehr has affirmed his commitment to cementing the DkP as the party of the middle class, and entrenching a more liberal ideology throughout German politics. For many of Germany's centrists and liberals, they see a bright future under Lehr - though it remains to be seen if the new Reichskanzler can fully rise to the moment."

After their first major triumph in years, Brüning has placed importance of the party being fully unified.\n\nThe cabinet Reichskanzler Brüning created is a reflection of this goal, bringing in members from across the spectrum of Zentrum factions, right, center, and left alike. It is a balancing act to keep the Zentrum satisfied, and appropriately reflect the political spectrum within the party.\n\nWith his position secured, Brüning intends to pursue objectives that reflect his desire to orient the Zentrum around an interdenominational Christian alliance, forming a coalition that focuses on a uniting force throughout Germany. With such a large and diverse coalition, Brüning will have a complex task ahead of him."

It has been years since the Zentrum held power, and Wirth intends to take full advantage of it.\n\nThe internal politics of the Zentrum have constrained some of Wirth's options, most prominently in his cabinet which includes members from across the Zentrum political spectrum. Nonetheless, these compromises have satisfied the party, paving the way to execute an ambitious policy agenda.\n\nWirth intends to pursue policies appealing to the left-wing of the country, which will likely be met with opposition in and beyond the Zentrum.

Yet the choice made by the German public was decisive, and given Bose a clear mandate to impose his vision upon Germany.\n\nBose's cabinet is a collection of familiar allies and faces that have surrounded him throughout his career, all of which are aligned on his identified priorities, which is to secure the German Empire, ensure its supremacy, and combat left-wing terrorism and insurrection.\n\nIt is expected that the security apparatus will grow, the military will be empowered, and the Kaiser will have the ear of the Reichskanzler.

krg_ger.601.d: "In an effort to bring the smaller agrarian parties into the coalition, Reichskanzler Bose offered to sit down with the senior members of these parties, and determine what was required for their support. There was a clear willingness from both parties for an alliance - the question was around what the Reichskanzler was willing to pay.\n\nThe agrarians have asked for a disproportionate say in our coalition, as well as the introduction and support for legislation that supports overt agrarian interests, from investments to subsidies. Some in the party call these demands absurd, especially since each group knows the leverage lies with the Reichskanzler.\n\nThe Reichskanzler, in the interest of a strong alliance and united coalition, can agree to some of their demands. Alternatively, both know the agrarians need him far more than he needs them, and he can call their bluff and demand their membership without concessions. It is almost certain to succeed, even if it would certainly worsen the Reichskanzler and DkP's reputation."

Most infamously during red Brunswick exposing Communard agent Samuel François in aiding the KAPD. The discovery was vital to the passing of the Enabling Act. Under von Bredow the Verpo was expanded to deal with domestic dissidents and once again proved instrumental in crating the Neur Staat.\n\n Now, Germany faces threats from the Accordist backstabers their traitorous republican puppets. And once again the Verpo will be expanded to accommodate. However, a new plan has arrived, Hans Bernd Gisevius has recommended taking to fight to the accord. With close connections in Britain, France and Italy Gisevius plans on taking out the accord from within. By supporting pacifist and anti-accordist movements, while dealing with accordist agents not just in Germany but across the whole Reichspakt, Gisevius will keep Germany safe. This will be a truly massive undertaking, even those within the Verpo feel this is a step to far. The so called 'Organisation Gisevius' and it's chief would have jurisdiction over not just Germany or Mitteleuropa but all of Europe.

However, sometimes the organization identifies suspicious connections, and this time has entered into an unprecedented situation.\n\nIt has been confirmed that a member of the Reichstag has connections with the Eiserne Front, and has been secretly sponsoring a cell of these terrorists. Once the determination was deemed iron-clad, the warrant was signed, and the traitor swiftly arrested.

In response, Interior Minister Gisevius has taken steps to significantly expand the role of the Verpo to combat this menace.\n\nThese new authorities allow the Verpo to be more aggressive in their monitoring efforts of government officials and party members. The requirements for search warrants have been reduced, and numerous cases of suspicious activity have been opened on individuals throughout the government and military.\n\nGovernment officials, officers, and representatives alike have approached Reichskanzler Bose with concerns, stating that the steps of the Interior Minister are crossing a line, and encouraging him to intervene before a witch hunt is started in the Reichstag that causes irreparable damage. After hearing the concerns, the Reichskanzler makes the choice to…"

No one but the Reichskanzler and Verpo leadership knew the full scope of the investigation, and everyone anxiously waited for the hammer to fall - until it finally did.\n\nIn the dead of night the Verpo arrested hundreds of suspected Eiserne Front members and supporters that they had identified within the government, Reichstag, citizenry, and the ranks of the military. While it isn't certain that everyone arrested was part of this group, the evidence already presented is clear that many are guilty - and with a single, clean decapitation stroke, the threat of the Eiserne Front appears to be ended."

Cutting education would worsen the quality of education for children, reduce payments for teachers, and halt or retract schooling programs. Cutting healthcare would almost certainly lead to a rise in sickness and preventable deaths across the country. Reduced infrastructure investment would halt needed construction programs or critical repairs.\n\nHowever, the numbers are clear.

Otto von Gerog Thierack was handpicked to lead the Justice Ministry, while Julius Liber was placed in the Interior Ministry.\n\nWith his cabinet assembled, and the party behind him, there are still questions on how von Ott will work to achieve his agenda, and if he will be able to rally the support to do it.

However, even they acknowledged that he was well-respected, knowledgeable, and popular within the DNEF.\n\nSome have quietly speculated that his popularity within the DNEF is what ultimately pushed Ott to select him, as he has received wide support for the decision throughout the party.

Thus the junkers continued to endure, retaining their influence despite our efforts.\n\nA new strategy must be employed. With the war ended, we can properly focus on resolving this problem. The junkers have been able to sustain themselves because of the support from industrial workers - and we can create an alternative to peel off their support. The Deutscher Betriebs-und Gewerbearbeitsfront has been proposed as an official Imperial trade union, intended to provide an alternative advocate to the junkers. Not all would join it, of course, but this will begin to gradually degrade their influence.\n\nThe second option that has been proposed is much simpler - blunt force.

With both being commoners and soldiers of working-class backgrounds, Ott even considered having him as a future cabinet member.\n\n However, Schmidt's outspoken personality has made him many enemies, especially within more conservative circles, earning him the nickname 'Schmidt the Lip'. Even the DNAP is viewed with skepticism, as merely a front for the SPD and socialism as a whole. Not only that, but Schmidt's commitment to Schachtist economics has made him popular with the BfD as well. Now, Schmidt proves to be a worthy ally or a fierce enemy, only one question remains, will the party see it that way?"

krg_ger.653.b: "Do you think we can forget 1940!"

krg_ger.654.t: "The Fourth Branch"
krg_ger.654.d: "The concept of the Wehrstatt - the formalization of military influence on politics - has been a controversial German political theory, with proponents who see it as a necessary evil to manage an important part of the governing dynamic. The military has always held influence within the state - the question was always how openly, and how much.\n\nWe have properly embraced the Wehrstatt concept, as the military's impact on the state must be properly incorporated into the power dynamic of the German government. Under this framework, military influence can be more easily regulated, controlled, and predictable - so long as we choose our allies in the military wisely.\n\nWith this framework in place, we have a mechanism to better empower those in the military who are aligned with us. There are three main groups that we could support: the Old Guard, who represent the traditional establishment of the military. Hardliners who are determined to ensure German military supremacy, and Reformists who believe in modernizing the military for future conflicts."

krg_ger.655.t: "The Second Red General"
krg_ger.655.d: "The moniker of the Red General was a title that the former Reichskanzler Schleicher accepted, despite its connotations with labor, and the whispers it invoked about its Syndicalist similarities. Yet few would deny that Schleicher's efforts are a reason why Syndicalism failed to gain the foothold it held in other nations/ Many have tried to emulate pieces of Schleicher's legacy - but few have claimed this one, until now.\n\nReichskanzler Ott has over time begun to be viewed in a similar light as Schleicher was. His tactics, priorities, and efforts, particularly concerning the economy, industry, and labor have been notably reminiscent of Schleicher - enough that many are calling him the Second Red General.\n\nMuch like Schleicher, Ott has accepted the moniker, and subtly encouraged it, judging that it has only solidified his popularity with the public. It is expected that Ott will continue to lean into this moniker, and should he continue succeeding, it is not unlikely that his legacy will one day be similar to Schleicher's."

Such a shift is one that the German military is undergoing.\n\nThe ranks of the German military are being filled with young officers with fresh ideas and new perspectives - but still hold the same fervent patriotism shared by their predecessors. New officers and generals are rising to succeed the old, and while the future German military will look different from the one which came before it, shaped by new technologies and strategies - it will certainly be more than capable of defending the Fatherland."

krg_gerdip.0.d: "Disaster! An unknown journalist has published a detailed report on the slavelike working conditions that some of our Afrikan subjects are enduring in the Rössing Mines of Südwestafrika. This so-called Rössing Dossier has made its way to every major newspaper in the world and many countries are issuing formal condemnations against our government. Our citizens, once believing our rule of Mittelafrika to be civil and just, are incensed. Major protests have broken out across the nation and many are calling for the government to resign. We must deal with this crisis immediately or risk losing our hold on Afika forever!. Call the Colonial Office and tell them to get rid of Thyssen at once!"
krg_gerdip.0.a: "Mein Gott!"

krg_gerdip.1.t: "Auswärtiges Amt: Report on the American Continents."
krg_gerdip.1.d: "For the eyes of the Kaiser and the Imperial Secretaries Only.\n\nCurrently, the situation in the Americas as they pertain to Germany can be broken down into three specific regions of interest. They are as follows:\n\nThe Former United States of America: Currently, the territory is divided between 4 successor governments, however the largest of these, and most conductive to German foreign policy, is the American Union State. During the Second American Civil War, Huey Long's government received funding and volunteers from the German Empire, though this support largely dried up with the Second Weltkrieg. However, there is an abundance of goodwill between the Longists and us, and with the Accord already with New England under their thumb, and currently making movements to secure the Pacific States of America for their own, it is vital that we secure our own powerbase in the AUS to oppose Canada and their puppet democracies.\n\nSouth America: For decades, we have enjoyed strong relations with the long-troubled nation of Argentina. These relations culminated in strong support for Manuel Carles' regime after the Christmas Coup, with Germany supporting Argentina throughout the Southern Cone Wars of 1938-1942, chiefly against Chile and Brazil. Today, Argentina is the master of the Cone, and her strength doesn't seem to be waning any time soon. This, combined with the rapidly growing hostility to once successful German interests in Brazil, means it is recommended that we shore up our reliable ally in Argentina as much as possible, even at the risk of polarising the situation in South America further.\n\nThe Caribbean: With Mexico remaining a godless syndicalist friendly state, and the Accord having secured much of the West Indies for their own purposes, it is vital that we establish a power base within the Caribbean Sea. Most of interest for this objective is the Dominican Republic. Ruled by Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo since 1938, the Dominican Republic is diplomatically isolated and already opposed to the Accord who have begun funding anti-Trujillo movements based out of the Republic of Cuba. As a result, diplomats have identified the Dominican Republic as a potentially reliable ally in the Americas, who will likely be unable to refuse any support we give them.\n\nWe hope this report will inform the cabinet of what moves we recommend they take in the Americas."

krg_gerdip.2.t: "Meeting El Jefe"
krg_gerdip.2.d: "Our meeting with Rafael Trujillo, or El Jefe as he likes to style himself, has been a resounding success. A quick tour of his tiny nation made it abundantly clear that we would be negotiating from a much stronger position than we had initially thought. This reality was not lost on General Trujillo either and he acquiesced to our demands with little fuss. In exchange for propping up his regime, "El Jefe" has granted German companies preferential treatment along with a significant amount of land where we can build our own air and naval facilities. The Kaiser will be most pleased with our forthcoming report."
krg_gerdip.2.a: "At last, a foothold in the New World."

krg_gerdip.3.t: "Expanding the Misión Alemana"
krg_gerdip.3.d: "The Argentine government has formally requested that we expand our military training mission in their country. The scope of the expansion requires that we send one of our higher ranked generals to Buenos Aires. Three possible candidates have emerged for this posting. First among them is Gotthard Heinrici. Arguably our best defensive expert, Heinrici is argumentative and difficult to work with and is understandably unpopular with high command. Argentina could prove to be a nice retirement for the old crank. The other two candidates are Friedrich Foertsch and Fritz Bayerlein. Younger officers, both served with distinction in the war and are expected to bring a stronger vitality and dedication to the post. Foertsch is a meticulous staff officer, while Bayerlein is a skilled panzer general."

krg_gerdip.6.d: "The Argentine government recently suggested that the great arms manufacturers of Germany should set up shop in Buenos Aires. They argue that such an arrangement would make the rearming of their military easier to accomplish as well as strengthen their economy as a whole. In exchange, we would be granted a percentage of the arms made each month. Berlin has agreed to the proposal.

Authorities in both Berlin and Dar es Salaam are at their wit's end with how to keep the massive colony together. Three options to help guide the Mittelafrikan Administration have been presented. The first calls for a division's worth of demobilized veterans to volunteer for service in the colony. The second proposal would have a group of the Fatherland's finest industrialists overhaul the colony's resource production and extraction efforts. The last option would see a team of skilled diplomats and civil servants sent to Dar es Salaam where they would work to keep the colony's numerous kings and chieftains happy and on our side."

The question of the summit was a simple one - how to keep Europe safe in the new world that was emerging?\n\nThere were many answers proposed to this question, and the summit was filled with lively and contentious debate. Though everyone knew that at the end of the day, it would be Germany who drove what direction the Reichspakt went, be it to maintain their militaries for a conventional conflict, or adopt a softer approach and utilize the diplomatic and economic power of Europe to deter those who would threaten it.\n\nAt the end of the summit, the Reichspakt made their choice to…"

krg_gerdip.11.t: "The Central European Nuclear Defence Treaty"
krg_gerdip.11.d: "In a widely-publicized press report, Germany announced the formation of the Central European Nuclear Defence Treaty, with foreign officials or heads of state from every Reichspakt member in attendance for one of the most historic events on the European continent.\n\nGermany announced that upon signing of the treaty, all members of the Reichspakt would now fall under the German nuclear umbrella - stating openly that any attack against a member state would be subject to the threat of nuclear retaliation - and that any nuclear strikes upon a Reichspakt member would receive equivalent retaliation.\n\nGermany also confirmed that nuclear weapons would now be stationed in certain Reichspakt nations who had agreed to host them, and additional infrastructure was being built to facilitate this - though both the infrastructure and atomic weapons would be controlled by Germany. Analysts across the world noted the development with concern, as this marks a significant shift, and for now chills the possibility of any war in Europe - or any potential dislodging of the German hegemon."
krg_gerdip.11.a: "Europe is under our protection, united, indivisible, and invincible."

krg_gerdip.12.t: "The New Afrikan Policy"
krg_gerdip.12.d: "Despite our best efforts, Mittelafrika, the crown jewel of the German Empire, is no more. All that remains is a squabbling collection of tribes, kingdoms, and pseudo-republics, almost all of them hostile to us. Not all is lost though. A few of our oldest colonies still claim loyalty to Kaiser und Vaterland. A majority in the government are calling for us to aid these friendly regimes. Most contain large populations of German settlers and aiding them would allow us to continue exerting influence on the continent. A few have suggested that we direct our efforts at sabotaging Accordist interests that have started to take root. This should be relatively easy to accomplish as the post-Mittelafrika order appears to be just as hostile to the Accord as they are to us. A small minority have said that we should cut our losses and abandon Afrika to its fate. This proposal is obviously the least popular of the three that have been presented."
krg_gerdip.12.a: "We shall aid friendly regimes."
krg_gerdip.12.b: "We shall sabotage Accordist interests."
krg_gerdip.12.c: "We shall salvage what we can."

krg_gerdip.13.d: "We are receiving reports from the Colonial Office that the locals in Madagaskar have stormed the capital and are trying to throw out the Schutztruppen from the Island. \n\nObviously we have a choice to make about how actively we want to involve ourselves here, as the government in Dar-es-Salaam are assuring us the matter is one of local unrest that they can handle."
krg_gerdip.13.a: "They can manage on their own."
krg_gerdip.13.b: "Berlin comes to Mittelafrika's aid."


krg_gerdip.14.t: "The State of Mitteleuropa"
krg_gerdip.14.d: "To say that Mitteleuropa is at a critical junction would be an understatement. The devastation brought on by the Second Weltkrieg has driven the alliance to its lowest point. Farms and factories across the continent lie ruined or unattended. The French Republic's refusal to honor the promise it made to join Mitteleuropa has not helped either as it was hoped that they would be able to shoulder some of the strain that the war caused. Our control of the industrialized northern half of France may not be the consolation prize that some may think as well. This unfortunate state of affairs has led to the other member-states of the alliance to call for reforms, making it a more equal partnership between nations and not one dominated by a single country chief among them. Obviously an unpopular prospect within the Chancellery, it may be the only way to keep Mitteleuropa alive. Adding new member-states such as the Danubian Federation along with the introduction of a common currency may be in order as well. Whatever may come, geography and the industriousness of the German people will almost always guarantee that the Reich remains the economic center of Europe."
krg_gerdip.14.a: "We've worked too hard to let Mitteleuropa fail now."

krg_gerfla.1.d: "The Kaiser has fallen seriously ill. As such, he has stopped carrying out his public engagements, which has led to suspicion falling on the Monarch. There are concerns that his health is rapidly failing, however the Kaiser himself would never admit to it. All mentions of the Kaiser's mystery illness have been barred from the press."

Later today the news will be announced to the nation, with Crown Prince Wilhelm ready to ascend to the throne once it's official."
krg_gerfla.2.a: "Long Live the Kaiser!"

krg_gerfla.3.t: "The Funeral of Wilhelm III"
krg_gerfla.3.d: "His Imperial Majesty, Wilhelm III, was laid to rest next to his father and grandfather at the Friedenskirche Mausoleum in Potsdam. Today's event was a somber one as rain and distant thunder hung over the procession. While not as beloved as his father, Wilhelm III nonetheless served as an important rallying symbol for his people during the darkest days of the Second Weltkrieg. This fact was demonstrated by the thousands of mourners who clogged the streets of Potsdam, all crowding together to get a final glimpse of the late kaiser. Dignitaries from around the world also came to pay their last respects. Notably absent was Edward VIII of the United Kingdom. Despite other senior members of the British royal family being in attendance, the recently restored king has chosen to thumb his nose at the Imperial family one last time. The two men, who were second cousins, held a deep hatred for one another that lasted the better part of three decades. One hopes that the new kaiser, Wilhelm IV will be able to mend relations between the two noble families. For now, such trifles can no longer burden a man who has had to carry the weight of the Reich upon his shoulders for ten long hard years."
krg_gerfla.3.a: "Rest now, Your Majesty."

krg_gerfla..t: "The End of the Republican Navy"
krg_gerfla..d: "The Republican Navy, scourge of the Atlantic and pride of the Union of Britain, is now no more. Divided earlier in the month between Germany, Canada, and the French Republic, the once mighty fleet awaited an uncertain future. Canadian and French officials announced soon afterwards that their allotments would either be scrapped or recommissioned into their respective navies. This left the Germans as the odd ones out as they refused to elaborate on their plans for their newly acquired ships. That changed this morning after a special television broadcast revealed the final fates of the 57 ships that the German government took as part of the Treaty of Oxford. All of the vessels, which included the aircraft carrier Revolution and the infamous battlecruisers Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Pride, were taken to the Indian Ocean earlier in the week. Lumped together with ships taken from Communard France, Socialist Italy, and German made vessels designated for the scrapyard, the ragtag battle group was held at anchor in a small lagoon some 37 kilometers northwest of the Seychelles. Secluded several miles away on a previously uninhabited stretch of coral and granite was a newly built observation post flanked on both sides by ships from Germany's Indian Sector Fleet. From there thousands of scientists, engineers, servicemen, and camera operators collectively held their breaths as a lone radio operator counted down to zero. In the blink of an eye, a towering geyser, 20,000 feet tall, erupted from the depths and was met by a calamitous roar and vicious torrent of boiling water. Hidden 15ft beneath the waves, directly in the middle of the ad hoc fleet, had been an atomic bomb.\n\nPart of a large-scale test to study the effects of an underwater nuclear explosion, this is the third atomic bomb ever tested and the first one since Heimdallr was used against Portsmouth in December 1947. Njord, the Norse-Germanic god of the sea, lended its name to this abyssal terror and its effects were clear to all who were present. Roughly equivalent to 23 kilotonnes of TNT, Njord left all but a few of the smaller ships located in or around its epicenter sunk or in the process of sinking. The French battleship Babeuf, which had commanded the Commune's Atlantic fleet, was split in two and immediately sank. She was soon followed by the aforementioned Revolution and the British heavy cruiser Robert Catesby. The rest of the ships, all heavily damaged, remained afloat with some beginning to list to one side or the other. Closer inspections of the aftermath were called off after it was discovered that lethal amounts of radiation were emanating from the charred hulls of the surviving ships. A highly informative test in its own right, Operation Bastion, as it was officially called, is also a thinly veiled threat aimed directly at the other major nations on planet Earth.\n\nThe German Empire remains the world's preeminent nuclear power; a position they will never give up willingly. In their minds, it is in everyone else's best interests to remain friendly with them. Do so and you have nothing to worry about but call down the thunder and you may risk reaping the whirlwind. Only time will tell how the rest of the world will react but for now the 20th Century, the German Century, marches on."

krg_gerfla.4.d: "The town of Spandau in Berlin's suburbs was greeted by cheering and celebrations today, featuring a full marching band from the nearby 5th Guards Infantry Brigade, as the first train on the newly constructed S3 line from Berlin Hauptbahnhof pulled into the station. While the construction of new rail lines and stations is not normally treated with nearly so much celebration and raucousness, three factors ensured that today's celebrations would be far from something to miss. The first is the fact that this is the tenth new section constructed in the postwar period, quite the feat for such a war-ravaged nation whose city saw a decline for nearly a decade. The second is the highly modern techniques used in its construction, featuring work from a number of European architects. The third is the fact that Spandau is not any suburb: its quiet streets are home to one of the largest arsenals in Germany, maintained outside the city by the Imperial military in order to provide for its defense. Hosted there are the 5th Guards Infantry Brigade, 5th Foot Guards, and the primary defensive command centers for the city of Berlin. As the civilians cheer its modernity and convenience, military planners have already begun to lay designated stopping points for evacuation trains and military command centers on its tracks, should the worst come to happen. Still, the people of Berlin and Spandau are enjoying their increased connection, and local newspapers should be printing listings for ticket collectors and conductors soon enough."

In addition to the famed Rote Kampfflieger himself, various members of the German royal families were in attendance along with notable celebrities and government officials. The most important attendee was, of course, His Imperial Majesty who began the ceremony with a short speech highlighting the various accomplishments of the Baron's career. Richthofen then took to the stage where he thanked friends, family, and God for the adventurous life he has led. The Kaiser and Baron concluded the morning's festivities with a ribbon cutting ceremony and welcomed the first group of VIP travelers to Frankfurt's newest attraction. Richthofen Airport is as impressive as the man himself. It is the largest and most modern airport in Europe and was designed with the traveler's comfort in mind. Restaurants, cafes, and snack bars are located at every terminal and a luxurious hotel is only a shuttle ride away for traveler's with long layovers."

krg_gerfla.6.d: "Crown Prince Wilhelm has completed a two month-long tour of Mittelafrika this week. Accompanied by his wife and two daughters, the future kaiser met with native leaders and government officials from across the vast colony. While a diplomatic mission first and foremost, the Crown Prince managed to spend the last week of the tour indulging in one of his favorite pastimes, big-game hunting. Arriving in the Nordrhodesien capital of Lusaka, Prince Wilhelm met with Vizestatthalter Ernst Jünger before traveling with him to Kafue National Park. Kafue, which opened earlier this year, is the largest national park in Afrika and is home to 152 different species of mammals. Working in conjunction with a small group of bodyguards and local guides, the two men set off to track down a pride of lions that had allegedly attacked a small village near the park's southern edge. The fourth day of tracking bore fruit as the group found a small watering hole that the lions had made their home next to. With sharp eye and steady hand, the Crown Prince took aim at the largest male and fired. The great beast let out a pained roar and made a short charge at his Royal Highness before dropping dead from severe blood loss. At 320kg, the lion is one the largest ever recorded. Those wishing to see the beast in person will get to do so soon as it will be placed on display in Berlin's newly rebuilt Museum of Natural History."

GER_wilhelm_iii: "Wilhelm III"
GER_wilhelm_iii_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 6th, 1882\nMarmorpalais, Potsdam, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nFrom a young age, Kaiser Wilhelm III was a militarist. While his father saw the Weltkrieg as a chance for vengeance against his personal enemies in Britain, the Kronprinz saw it as the formative experience of a superpower. He would lead troops in Verdun and Amiens, and though his victories were average, it would be on the battlefields where Wilhelm would meet a young Major named Kurt von Schleicher.\n\nThe Weltkrieg's successes vindicated the Kronprinz, while the subsequent stagnation of Germany turned him fully against democracy. When Black Monday plunged Berlin into darkness and Reichskanzler Herbert von Dirksen resigned, democracy failed Germany and Kronprinz Wilhelm saw his opportunity. Kurt von Schleicher, now Prussian Minister of War, was appointed to the position of Reichskanzler at the request of the Kronprinz in 1936 as a respectable moderate.\n\nWhile his ‘Red General’ was able to maintain the cooperation of the Demokratische Union and Koalition Schwarz-Weiß-Rot for a time, he would play them against one another in order to divide his rivals and prevent a vote-of-no-confidence. Using the Ruhrkampf as an excuse, von Schleicher passed the Enabling Act allowing the Reichskanzler to enact executive decrees at will. Together, the two men instituted militaristic policies that transformed their collapsing nation into the empire of old; a true military powerhouse. When Schleicher died in 1945, Wilhelm promoted the loyal Ferdinand von Bredow in his place. Keenly interested in the power of the atom, Wilhelm witnessed the Heimat Test in Windhoek, and pushed relentlessly for Heimdallr to be unleashed on his enemies.\n\nNow, those enemies lay destroyed, and the Kaiser stands victorious. An avowed autocrat, Wilhelm has joined Reichskanzler Bredow in planning for a 'Zentralisierung' of the government, though the growing domestic troubles need to be dealt with before any change can be implemented. On the world stage, Wilhelm's opinion of the liberal superpowers is plummeting. Thinking nothing of his so-called 'equals' in France and Canada, he sees them as naive and weak, led by idealists who don't understand the modern world. His world. The Kaiserwelt."
GER_wilhelm_iv: "Wilhelm IV"
GER_wilhelm_iv_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nJuly 4th, 1906\nMarmorpalais, Potsdam, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\nWilhelm Friedrich Franz Joseph Christian Olaf of the House of Hohenzollern, By the Grace of God, German Emperor and King of Prussia. The fourth to bear the regal name Wilhelm, the new Kaiser inherits a nation beset with uncertainty. Much of Germany lies in ruins. Its famed industrial heart, the Rhineland, a smoldering pile of rubble. The "New State" initiative championed by his father remains divisive among the people with many accusing it of being nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at turning the nation into an autocratic police state. Tensions with the Russian State remain high with only a shaky armistice keeping the peace between the two nations. German influence in Asia and the Pacific is all but lost following an ill-fated attempt to defend our colonies against the perfidious Japanese. Across the Atlantic, Canada looks to supplant the Reich as the dominant power in the world. Closer to home is the issue of his succession. Having no sons, Wilhelm will have to confront a chauvinistic sociopolitical establishment that will surely fight against any attempt he makes to ensure his eldest daughter can succeed him. But much like his predecessors before him, the young Kaiser is strong-willed and determined to get what he wants.\n\nWhile not as experienced in the political realm as he would like to be, Wilhelm IV still adheres to the age-old Prussian virtues of honor, militarism, and service to the state. Serving with distinction in the Second Weltkrieg, Wilhelm IV defied expectations by having a far more engaging and successful military career than the vast majority of his royal contemporaries. Commanding Panzer Army Leibgarde as part of Army Group Deutscher Kronprinz, Wilhelm first saw action in the Battle of Liège. Russia's entry into the war led to his army group being transferred to the Eastern Front where he worked alongside his uncle, Prince Oskar, in attempting to hold back the Russian advance into the Baltic states. He and his chief of staff, General Hans Speidel, are credited with the destruction of the Russian 7th Tank Army during the Battle of Warsaw. These victories made the Crown Prince very popular back home both with commoners and the elite, newspapers often likening his exploits to that of Frederick the Great.\n\nThe devastation that the war inflicted on Europe has had a profound effect on Wilhelm. The invention of jet aircraft and guided missiles has convinced him that technological innovation will give his empire the best chance at maintaining its dominant position in the world. More than that, innovation could be the only thing that'll ensure the survival of his people from a Kalterkrieg that may become engulfed in atomic fire."
