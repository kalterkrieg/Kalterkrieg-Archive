### National Spirits ###
POL_return_of_the_king: "The Return of the King"
POL_return_of_the_king_desc: "The Return of King Alexander II and the restoration of the monarchy after the period of the General-Government through the years 1942-1948 is a return to normalcy that many find calming, even if others chafe under the continuation of the regime of a foreign ruler."
POL_lust_for_freedom: "A Lust for Freedom"
POL_lust_for_freedom_desc: "Poland has spent over 133 years as a pawn of the greater powers around it. Her people live across borders imposed by larger forces. They are ruled by a foreigner. The nation is nominally governed by Polish persons but they are nothing but collaborators and catspaws. Even during the war, there was no chance to escape, instead battered between the tides of the German and Russian forces like a leaf on the breeze. The people grow restless, feeling they have no future, unless something is to change."
POL_four_years_of_occupation: "Four Years of Civil War"
POL_four_years_of_occupation_desc: "During the war, between 1942 and 1946 the Polish National Republic occupied and held the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Poland. When Danubia entered the war and the Russian forces were pushed back, the Polish Kingdom was left scarred and ruined. While the war was ongoing, energy was spent towards winning victory in the East at great cost to all involved. Now, there is finally a chance for respite and recovery, but the road will be long."
POL_general_government: "Rule of the General-Governor"
POL_general_government_desc: "The instability in the country and the war in the East has meant that the King had to flee Poland and the military stepped in to lead the fight against the traitorous republicans."

krg_pol.0.t: "General-GovernorVon Kries Steps Down"
krg_pol.0.d: "With the stabilisation of the situation nationally and the continued peace to the East with the Armistice signed, the time has come for Wolfgang von Kries to step aside and allow Alexander II to return from his temporary exile to his family estates in Brandenburg. No doubt the young king will be excited to get down to the business of ruling."
krg_pol.0.a: "Long live the King!"
krg_pol.1.t: "The Return of Alexander II"
krg_pol.1.d: "After the situation in Poland during the war turned to such unrest, the military under General Wolfgang von Kries was forced to step in, with Alexander II fleeing to the family estates in Brandenburg to sit out the war in relative safety.\n\nNow that the situation has been stabilised in the country, Governorvon Kries is stepping aside to provide for the return of the King. However Alexander was not the King of Poland when he left the country, so it remains to be seen just how popular the young monarch may prove with his subjects. But there is an air of optimism in the country, and the Polish people seem to be more upbeat with the prospect of the return of their ruler."
krg_pol.1.a: "Long Live the King"
krg_pol.2.t: "Organising the Government"
krg_pol.2.d: "After the stepdown of the Governor, the military is looking to handover to a new Polish government, but the final form of that government has not been decided. Looking to events in Germany and our own Monarch's connection to the country, it seems natural we will emulate them. The question is how precisely.\n\nThere is a faction who are look to the muscular government of the German National Unity front as an example that we can draw upon, and a second who feel that we would be served by the system the National Unity Front is currently solving a specific problem of, namely a government in the mould of the Prussian Constitution of 1871.\n\nUltimately the decision lies with the king, as to what he will give his assent to."
krg_pol.2.a: "A Polish Schliecherism"
krg_pol.2.b: "A Constitutional Monarchy."
krg_pol.3.t: "The New Polish Order"
krg_pol.3.d: "With the recent return of the King to Poland and the winding down of the military administration in the country, the King has given his assent to a government alike that of the Bredowist National Unity Front in neighbouring Germany.\n\nThe decision comes at a time when the DNEF is being tested by current events, but it seems like the Polish have made the conscious decision to emulate Germany as fully as possible. Commentators state that the King seeks to capture the success of the muscular style of government practiced by von Schliecher and von Bredow."
krg_pol.3.a: "The General Government in all but Name"
krg_pol.4.t: "Democracy Restored in Poland"
krg_pol.4.d: "With the recent return of the King to Poland and the winding down of the military administration in the country, the King has given his assent to a government moulded on the lines of the Prussian Constitution of 1871.\n\nThis comes as a surprise to some spectators who thought they would seek a closer and more direct emulation of Germany by installing a National Unity Front government or something like it, but it seems instead that the King is willing to permit an experiment in Democracy, perhaps hoping to woo his subjects by giving them more of a voice in the running of the state."
krg_pol.4.a: "Poland Moves Into the Modern Age"
