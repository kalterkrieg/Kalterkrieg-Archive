krg_ara.4.d: "The Arabs have sent us a proposal to form a joint company to exploit the oil of Arabia. Prospectors from Wintershall and Royal Dutch Shell have found sizable deposits in Seismic surveys, and there will be a great opportunity here for us to lock in supply from Arabia if we proceed with this.
