krg_vin.0.t: "The Viet Minh mobilise to attack us!"
krg_vin.0.d: "Those godless heathens who preach the harmful philosophy of dialectical materialism have taken up arms and sought to overthrow the government! The people are incensed by the Japanese troops taking their supplies too violently and the leftists have seized on this as an opportunity to launch their assault on the state."
krg_vin.0.a: "Shoot them all!"
krg_vin.0.b: "Forwards, Comrades! (play as Vietnamese National Liberation Front)"

krg_vin_news.0.t: "Leftists Rise Up in Vietnam!"
krg_vin_news.0.d: "The Japanese client state of the Empire of Vietnam, former territory of German East Asia, has collapsed into civil war today with the regime of Bao Dai.\n\nJapanese troops had apparently violently requisitioned supplies from some locals and this has been the final straw for the populace, with the leftist revolutionary movements of Indochina seizing on the news to launch their attempt at true national independence.\n\nWe have additionally received scattered reports of Laotian and Cambodian partisans also taking up arms in Siam. How this will end, nobody knows, but there is once again war in the jungle."
krg_vin_news.0.a: "Cracks in the Pacific Titan?"

krg_vin_news.1.t: "Japan Withdraws from Indochina!"
krg_vin_news.1.d: "The Japanese Empire has officially suspended all activity within Indochina, citing strategic realignment. In the former Empire of Vietnam, a resurgent Viet Minh rose up from the jungle, causing an all-out war in the region.\n\nAfter a prolonged guerrilla conflict, the Empire of Vietnam has collapsed, and Japanese forces have been forced to fend for themselves. An agreement seems to have been reached, recognizing the new state of Indochina. Intern POWs have been returned, and Japan's vested interest in the South China Sea has been recognized by the revolutionary governments."
krg_vin_news.1.a: "Have the Dominoes Started Falling?"
