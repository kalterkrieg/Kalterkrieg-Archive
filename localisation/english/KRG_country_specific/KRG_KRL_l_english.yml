KRL_militarbefehlshaber_in_courland: "Militarbefehlshaber in Kurland"

## National Spirits
KRL_Rump_State: "Rump State"
KRL_Rump_State_desc: "With the loss of all the land north of the Daugava river, Kurland is nothing more than a rump state of the previous Baltic Duchy. The two major cities of Riga and Reval are no longer under our control, and thus, Kurland is left with no major ports or cities to conduct commerce from."
KRL_Baltic_Shame: "Baltic Shame"
KRL_Baltic_Shame_desc: "The chaos of 1936 culminated in a coup by the Pan-German Baltic Brotherhood. Their heavy-handed suppression of the Forest Brothers and subsequent repression of the native Baltic peoples now stains the lands. Berlin blames this regime for weakening the Riga-Vilnius line that let the Russians through the Baltics during the 2nd Weltkrieg, equating it to self-sabotage. Those Baltic Germans who did not perish during the war now hang their heads in shame for what they've caused."
KRL_Baltic_Shame_2: "Baltic Shame"
KRL_Baltic_Shame_2_desc: "The chaos of 1936 culminated in a coup by the Pan-German Baltic Brotherhood. Their heavy-handed suppression of the Forest Brothers and subsequent repression of the native Baltic peoples now stains the lands. Berlin blames this regime for weakening the Riga-Vilnius line that let the Russians through the Baltics during the 2nd Weltkrieg, equating it to self-sabotage. Those Baltic Germans who did not perish during the war now hang their heads in shame for what they've caused, but at least now those who remained have been prosecuted by the state, the country can feel somewhat better."

KRL_Berlins_Administration: "Berlin's Administration"
KRL_Berlins_Administration_desc: "Berlin has taken direct control of Kurland's reconstruction, taking responsibility for it's governance, rebuilding efforts, and protection. While we couldn't possibly rebuild Kurland ourselves, this administration also directly absorbed what remained of our military forces asides from a few garrisons, and prevents us from raising any new battalions. For the moment, the fate of Kurland is unknown."
KRL_Socialist_Resistance: "Socialist Resistance"
KRL_Socialist_Resistance_desc: "The breakout of skirmishes between the military government and the small socialist resistance has presented a problem for the government, this resistance will grow in the future and will cause problems if not dealt with."
KRL_German_Construction_Corps: "Deutsches Heer Baukorps"
KRL_German_Construction_Corps_desc: "A brigade of the Construction Corps of the German Army are presently assigned to Rebuilding Libau"

##events
krg_krl.0.t: "The Weidling Plan"
krg_krl.0.d: "The reconstruction of Kurland has thus far been a rather sedate affair, with other regions of the Reichspakt requiring more from Germany. However Feldmarschall Weidling has been diligently working to the best of his abilities and capabilities to provide a plan for the country in order to lift the state out of the mess that it has been in since the signing of the Armistice.\n\nHe's looking to restart and recover the stalled economy, and prepare the nation for a handover back to a civilian government."
krg_krl.0.a: "Best of luck, Feldmarschall!"

krg_krl.1.t: "Handover to the Provisional Government"
krg_krl.1.d: "Today, the Weidling Plan has culminated and leaves behind a state with the ability to defend itself, to build and grow, and to serve as a valued member of the Reichspakt in the east."
krg_krl.1.a: "Congratulations Gentlemen!"

krg_krl.2.t: "Kurland responds to Latvian Aggression!"
krg_krl.2.d: "The Duchy of Kurland today sent troops against the forces of the semi-recognised Latvian state with the stated aim of crossing the Daugava river and finishing the regime there after 'unprecedented aggression' against garrison troops in Kurland.\n\nInternational observers have stated that Russian weakness is at the root of this action, rather than any explicit Latvian behaviour, but there is little that the Latvians can do at present."
krg_krl.2.a: "Another war with the forest brothers?"

krg_krl.3.t: "Kurland proclaims victory in Latvia!"
krg_krl.3.d: "Kurlandish and Reichspakt troops proclaimed victory and annexation of the 'illegal' Latvian state. What this bodes for Estonia is unknown at this time, but the leader of the Provisional government, Friedrich Bucholdt assured the international press that the Kurland Duchy had no further territorial ambitions in the Baltic.\n\n'What we have done here is re-established the Eastern Bulwark of the Reichspakt, nothing more.'"
krg_krl.3.a: "The Baltics will remain intriguing."

krg_krl.4.t: "Moving the Capital"
krg_krl.4.d: "The former capital of the United Baltic Duchy Riga, or Reval as it is known in German, is now once more in our hands.\n\nSome feel that we should return the capital to Riga to cement our legitimacy.\n\nOthers argue that we have spent a great deal of energy in building up Libau, that it is further from Russia and closer to Germany, and that Riga is still a dangerous place for the government given it was the seat of the 'Independant Latvian State' until recently and therefore we should not move there."
krg_krl.4.a: "Fear be damned, Riga is the capital."
krg_krl.4.b: "Libau makes more sense, stay put."

krg_krl.5.t: "Distributing Seed and Supplies"
krg_krl.5.d: "German Army troops today spent their time distributing free seed and farming equipment in the Kurlandish countryside. This support to Latvian farmers came in the form of many potatoes, which will guarantee a good harvest in future years."
krg_krl.5.a: "Excellent news."


##Foci
KRL_Weidling_Plan: "The Weidling Plan"
KRL_Weidling_Plan_desc: "General Weidling has not been idle while administering Kurland. No sir, he has not. He is now busily finalising the details of how to resolve the blights on the beleaguered rump of the United Baltic Duchy."
KRL_support_latvian_farmers: "Support the Farmers"
KRL_support_latvian_farmers_desc: "Food prices remain high in Libau. The best way to resolve this is to provide additional funding to farms in order for next year to have a better harvest."
KRL_rebuild_Libau: "Rebuild Libau"
KRL_rebuild_Libau_desc: "The Capital City still bears the scars of it's wartime experience. It would be prudent to renovate the city so we might cast off this shabby despair that clings to the country."
KRL_repair_the_railways: "Repair the Railways"
KRL_repair_the_railways_desc: "The Kurland Coast Railway fell into disrepair during the war. Rebuilding it will strengthen the economic ties that bind the remainder of the country."
KRL_build_policing_institutions: "Reform the Police"
KRL_build_policing_institutions_desc: "The current police force is woefully inadequate. By reorganising them we can actually start to deal with the Socialists lurking in the countryside effectively."
KRL_revive_rural_economy: "Revive the Rural Economy"
KRL_revive_rural_economy_desc: "A hungry people are more likely to be swayed by political extremists and promises of change. Development of industry in the countryside will provide jobs, put food on tables and give people a sense that Germany does care for her allies in the East still."
KRL_legitimise_judiciary: "Legitimise the Judiciary"
KRL_legitimise_judiciary_desc: "The historical judiciary were very biased in supporting the Baltic Germans over the other ethnicities. This caused the implosion of the armed forces during the Weltkrieg. We must legitimise our rule here by providing fair justice for all."
KRL_root_out_syndicalists: "Root Out the Resistance"
KRL_root_out_syndicalists_desc: "With a reformed police corp and the support of the German army, we should be able to root out any resistance forces remaining in our territory, either capturing them or driving them abroad."
KRL_build_the_Libau_port: "Building a Port in Libau"
KRL_build_the_Libau_port_desc: "Everything in Libau remains expensive because the city has only a train connection for incoming goods and aid. By building a port we will be able to take shipping properly and the country will be better positioned to recover from the war."
KRL_clean_the_stain: "Cleaning the Stain"
KRL_clean_the_stain_desc: "Prosecution of those still able to be prosecuted for the mistakes made during the war time, and for allowing the disastrous events in the United Baltic Duchy will allow the shame of the people to be reduced, somewhat."
KRL_reallow_service: "Reallow Armed Service"
KRL_reallow_service_desc: "The steps taken by the government mean that Kurland can again be trusted with an army."
KRL_open_Libau_technical_school: "Open the Libau Technical School"
KRL_open_Libau_technical_school_desc: "The development of trades requires additional tradesmen. It's best to train our own rather than import them from Germany."
KRL_develop_Libau_further: "Develop Libau Further"
KRL_develop_Libau_further_desc: "Things are looking up economically in Libau, as Germany succeeds, so do we. However we cannot simply rely on Germany - we must develop our own resources further."
KRL_hand_over_to_civilian_government: "Handover to Civilian Government"
KRL_hand_over_to_civilian_government_desc: "Kurland has been recovered, at least to the level that the German army is no longer needed to directly administer the region. The government will now be handed over to a provisional authority."
KRL_introduce_conscription: "Reintroduce Conscription"
KRL_introduce_conscription_desc: "The Provisional Government still wishes to reclaim the lands of Livonia in order to unify the region and protect the national interests of all ethnicities against the threat posed by Russia. This however does mean certain sacrifices must be made."
KRL_seek_mitteleuropa_readmission: "Seek Reincorporation to Mitteleuropa"
KRL_seek_mitteleuropa_readmission_desc: "Our diplomats should actively petition Germany for readmission to Mitteleuropa. The present situation a result of ensuring Army funds were not misappropriated via double taxation but now tariffs harm our economy. We can gain partnership easily, but we should pursue full membership once again."
KRL_open_markets: "Open Up to the Global Market"
KRL_open_markets_desc: "Liberalisation of our trade laws will allow us to continue our economic recovery in a quicker fashion than rejoining the Mitteleuropan block. Of course we can re-evaluate this decision in the future, but the provisional government believes this is the correct path now."
KRL_new_eastern_bulwark: "New Eastern Bulwark"
KRL_new_eastern_bulwark_desc: "The long-term prosperity of all in the Reichspakt relies on the strength of those on the Eastern front against Russia. Though Kurland is only a small part of that, we should reaffirm our place within the organisation."
KRL_new_hardware: "Acquire New Hardware"
KRL_new_hardware_desc: "Through our Mitteleuropa connections and our reaffirmed position as part of the Eastern Bulwark of the Reichspakt, we will be able to acquire new guns from Germany to supply our forces with."
KRL_relax_border_controls: "Relax Border Controls"
KRL_relax_border_controls_desc: "The closed borders are a remnant of the military occupation era. We should reduce the difficulties for non-Kurlanders to enter our country, that we might profit from their knowledge."
KRL_foreign_investments: "Foreign Investments"
KRL_foreign_investments_desc: "Our new economic arrangement has reaped benefits in the form of interested foreigners looking to invest in our country"
KRL_open_labour_market_further: "Open up the Labour Market"
KRL_open_labour_market_further_desc: "The influx of foreigners has proven beneficial and more could move here if there were less barriers. Perhaps this will help resolve the lingering inter-ethnic strife."
KRL_take_advantage_of_Latvia: "Take Advantage of Latvian Weakness"
KRL_take_advantage_of_Latvia_desc: "Russia is in disarray, now is the time to reclaim Livonia!"

### Political leader descs

POLITICS_HELMUTH_WEIDLING_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nNovember 2nd, 1891\nHalberstadt, Provinz Sachsen, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n Weidling entered the military in 1911 and served as a lieutenant in the First Weltkrieg. After his competent performance he remained in the military and served on the Eastern Front through the Second Weltkrieg, playing a key role in the defence of East Prussia and Königsberg against the Russian attack as the leader of the XLI Panzer Corps \n\nWith the Danubian entry into the war, Weidling was part of the German counter offensive and fought for the liberation of Courland against the Russian forces pocketed there. After the pocket was cleared, the plan began to form about crossing the Daugava, and then the war suddenly ended with the detonation of Heimdallr and the invasion of Britain.\n\nHelmuth Weidling now spends his days in his office, awaiting further orders and administering the rump-state strip of land that Courland has become as the last remnant of the United Baltic Duchy, whilst to the North the Forest Brothers proclaim their independant Latvian national state, and the remnant of the Baltic German people cluster around Libau."
