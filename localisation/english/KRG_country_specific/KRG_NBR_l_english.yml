### Events ###
krg_nbr.0.t: "The North Borneo National Convention"
krg_nbr.0.d: "With the recent events in Malaya, it has been deemed a good idea to hold our own National Convention, so that we might proceed further in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere than being junior partners under Japanese direct administration."
krg_nbr.0.a: "Summon the representatives!"

krg_nbr.1.t: "The White Rajah's Status"
krg_nbr.1.d: "His Highness Charles Vyner Brooke, the third white Rajah of Sarawak still remains in exile in Sydney. Whilst there were none who were openly willing to show their support amongst those who came to the convention, the removal of his title and the declaration of the resumption of native rule of Sarawak was an uncontroversial decision to make and started the convention off on good grounds."
krg_nbr.1.a: "Cower in Australasia, old man!"

krg_nbr.2.t: "The Status of the Regions"
krg_nbr.2.d: "The various parts of the North Borneo Republic represent separate but equal parts of the country. The cultural and ethnic mix meant there was no strong motive toward centralism from any part of the convention. Negotiations continued however, ensuring the extent of how loose the alliance would be."
krg_nbr.2.a: "Federalism perhaps?"

krg_nbr.3.t: "Brunei requests expanded autonomy"
krg_nbr.3.d: "The Sultan of Brunei has requested that the territory of his dominion be given extensive autonomy from the greater whole, in exchange for not claiming a centralising mission or federal leadership that could be given by historical merit.\n\nWhile some representatives found such a request presumptuous, the majority were willing to abide by it if things continued smoothly."
krg_nbr.3.a: "Sure, I suppose."

krg_nbr.4.t: "The Matter of Ethnic Rights"
krg_nbr.4.d: "With the special concession to Brunei agreed on by a majority vote, a federal state of Sarawak, Sandokan and Sabah with a special autonomy of Brunei was written into the constitutional draft to great applause by the convention\n\nGiven the mix of peoples and cultures in North Borneo, the discussion turned to the specific rights of various ethnicities and how the state would handle them."
krg_nbr.4.a: "Equality, surely?"

krg_nbr.5.t: "Dayak Representatives request special treatment"
krg_nbr.5.d: "Given the remote and harsh lifestyle in the interior, the Dayak people are somewhat differentiated from the more cosmopolitan social groups who live along the coastline. As such their representatives along with others from Sarawak suggested they should be given additional opportunities in education and employment to compensate their difficulties."
krg_nbr.5.a: "We will consider it"

krg_nbr.6.t: "The Sultan Makes Another Request"
krg_nbr.6.d: "Brunei would request that if a concession is made to the Dayak representatives, the Malays on the island should also receive some benefit of state care given the historical injustices perpetuated against them by the Chinese merchant class."
krg_nbr.6.a: "What next, the Indians?"

krg_nbr.7.t: "A fraught compromise reached"
krg_nbr.7.d: "After a long and drawn out discussion, several provisions were written into the draft constitution, stating that while all peoples are considered equal, special attention to the care of and nourishing of historically oppressed peoples would be taken by the state.\n\nThis was passed by a narrow margin, with several representatives darkly muttering about the interference of Brunei.\n\n The topic of whether or not the state should have an official religion or if it should be separate came up. Given that there are groups who practise Christianity, Islam and traditional Animism, the discussion seemed to tend toward keeping out of people's relationship with God."
krg_nbr.7.a: "Oh great!"

krg_nbr.8.t: "Islam and the Sultan"
krg_nbr.8.d: "The Sultan of Brunei is insisting that Islam be included in the constitution of the country, and that the nation be an Islamic state in it's official capacity.\n\nSeveral representatives from Sarawak have argued that this cannot be the case."
krg_nbr.8.a: "This can't end well."

krg_nbr.9.t: "Sarawakese Representatives Depart"
krg_nbr.9.d: "With the Sultan refusing to change his tone on the Islamic state matter, the Sarawakese representatives have decided en masse to leave the National Convention, decrying the position and inflexibility of the Sultan of Brunei to all and sundry. The Japanese seem to be preparing to take some action after this disaster."
krg_nbr.9.a: "Oh damnit"

krg_nbr.10.t: "The National Convention Fails"
krg_nbr.10.d: "With the withdrawal of the Sarawakese, the representatives from Sabah and Sandokan departed shortly after, leaving only the Bruneians. The draft constitution was taken for safekeeping and presented to the Japanese Commander by some of the Sarawakese representatives when they departed, so it is expected that [NBR.GetLeader] will give a directive to reconvene under a finalised constitutional order provided by his own staff."
krg_nbr.10.a: "How embarrassing"
krg_nbr.10.b: "The Military Stays"

krg_nbr.11.t: "North Borneo National Convention Fails"
krg_nbr.11.d: "While initially promising, the talks for a draft constitution for North Borneo have broken down after the Sultan of Brunei insisted the country be an Islamic state. The provisions were that the White Rajah of Sarawak was officially disavowed, that the state would have a federalist character with Bruneian autonomy enshrined and that the Malays and Dayaks would receive state help in development. Several of these were somewhat controversial but agreed upon, aside from this one sticking point.\n\nThe primary issue seems to be the religious character of the North Bornean state. [NBR.GetLeader] recommends simply leaving that section of the constitution out and returning as it is otherwise."
krg_nbr.11.a: "No religion. Solved."

krg_nbr.12.t: "An Expurgated Constitution Returned"
krg_nbr.12.d: "The Japanese have returned the constitution as it was aside from any mention of religion has been removed entirely and the topic is to be considered closed. The representatives have been recalled to the National Convention in order to debate the last order of business, which is who shall lead the state."
krg_nbr.12.a: "I can guess one candidate!"

krg_nbr.13.t: "The Nature of the State"
krg_nbr.13.d: "The choice here is somewhat simple. We can form a republic under a President, or we can let the Sultan of Brunei take charge since as last monarch standing he has a strong interest in the running of affairs.\n\nSeveral representatives have advocated for a Republic and stated they are concerned about how long the Constitution will stand unamended if the Sultan is left to rule. Others have said they prefer someone who has experience in government, as the Sultan has, compared to a fresh politician every few years."
krg_nbr.13.a: "Let us choose a President"
krg_nbr.13.b: "The Sultan can do it."

krg_nbr.14.t: "Handover to Government in North Borneo" #Japan
krg_nbr.14.d: "Placeholder: The North Borneans, with a little Japanese help, have written a constitution, and decided how they want to run their country in the GEACPS. We should let them get on with it, right?"
krg_nbr.14.a: "One less thing to worry about!"
krg_nbr.14.b: "Actually, we had plans for Borneo!"

krg_nbr.15.t: "Regional Autonomy"
krg_nbr.15.d: ""
krg_nbr.15.a: "As planned"

krg_nbr.16.t: "Status of the Sultan"
krg_nbr.16.d: "Placeholder: What is to happen to the Sultan of Brunei."
krg_nbr.16.a: "He can stay in his palace"

krg_nbr.17.t: "A flourishing land"
krg_nbr.17.d: ""
krg_nbr.17.a: "Praise the President!"

krg_nbr.18.t: "A Greater Sultanate"
krg_nbr.18.d: "Placeholder: The Sultante of Brunei has been expanded to the entire territory of North Borneo."
krg_nbr.18.a: "Congratulations your Highness"

krg_nbr.19.t: "Dispensing of Federalism"
krg_nbr.19.d: "Placeholder: The ideas of federalism are needless as all lay equally beneath the Sultan and his government."
krg_nbr.19.a: "Needless Overhead"

krg_nbr.20.t: "Rebels! In the Hills!"
krg_nbr.20.d: "Placeholder: With the growing authoritarianism of the Sultan's government a active resistance has started in the countryside."
krg_nbr.20.a: "This cannot end well"

krg_nbr.21.t: "Enshrine Islam in the State"
krg_nbr.21.d: "Placeholder: "
krg_nbr.21.a: "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger"

krg_nbr.22.t: "Republican Revolutionaries Storm the Palace!"
krg_nbr.22.d: "Placeholder: With growing unrest in the country a mob of republican revolutionises have made their way into the palace to force the Sultan to step down and allow the formation of a republic"
krg_nbr.22.a: "The Sultan and his guards are triumphant"
krg_nbr.22.b: "The Rebels Triumph!"

krg_nbr.23.t: "Let us seek union with a stronger state"
krg_nbr.23.d: "Placeholder: The country continues to spiral so the new PRBU government proposes the idea of joining one of our stronger neighbours."
krg_nbr.23.a: "Seek union with Insulindia"
krg_nbr.23.b: "Seek union with Malaya"
krg_nbr.23.c: "We are strong alone"

krg_nbr.24.t: "North Borneo wants to join another regional power"
krg_nbr.24.d1: "Placeholder: The new republican government in North Borneo wishes to join Insulindia. The military has come out as greatly against this as it would diminish our control over the area."
krg_nbr.24.d2: "Placeholder: The new republican government in North Borneo wishes to join Malaya. While controversial within our government it would help to consolidate our allies and influence in the region."
krg_nbr.24.a: "Block the union"
krg_nbr.24.b: "Allow the Union"

krg_nbr.25.t: "Japan blocks the union"
krg_nbr.25.d: "Placeholder: Japan citing the destabilizing factor of joining a different country has blocked our attempt."
krg_nbr.25.a: "So we go this way"

krg_nbr.26.t: "Japan approves the union"
krg_nbr.26.d: "Placeholder: Japan has approved the union."
krg_nbr.26.a: "We should ask the other party then!"

krg_nbr.27.t: "North Borneo wants a union"
krg_nbr.27.d: "Placeholder: The new government in North Borneo whishes to join our state. Already having gained permission by Japan all we need to do is give our answer."
krg_nbr.27.a: "It's free real estate!"
krg_nbr.27.b: "They can solve their own problems"

krg_nbr.28.t: "Formation of the united Malaysia"
krg_nbr.28.d: "Placeholder: With North Borneo joining the nation we have become a true untied Malay state."
krg_nbr.28.a: "Togheter brothers"

krg_nbr.29.t: "The other country blocks the union"
krg_nbr.29.d: "Placeholder: Citing the destabilizing factor of us joining their nation we have been blocked entry."
krg_nbr.29.a: "We shall survive alone"

krg_nbr_news.0.t: "North Borneo Republic signed over by Japanese"
krg_nbr_news.0.d: "Reports are coming in that after a fractuous national convention and apparent back and forth with the Sultan of Brunei, the former Japanese Protectorate of North Borneo has now been officially released from direct rule by the Imperial Japanese Army under General Moritake Tanabe, and has instead come into an era of democratically elected leadership under [NBR.GetLeader].\n\nThis news follows other Japanese moves to reduce imperial overhead despite the military seeking to continue rule in the region for an indefinite period. \n\nIt seems that the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere seems to be delivering on its promises of Asia for the Asians in North Borneo."
krg_nbr_news.0.a: "Hmm, intriguing"

krg_nbr_news.1.t: "Sultanate of Brunei signed over by Japanese"
krg_nbr_news.1.d: "Reports are coming in that after a fractuous national convention and apparent back and forth with the Sultan of Brunei, the former Japanese Protectorate of North Borneo has now been officially released from direct rule by the Imperial Japanese Army under General Moritake Tanabe, and has instead come into an era of leadership under the Sultan of Brunei, His Royal Highness, [NBR.GetLeader].\n\nThis news follows other Japanese moves to reduce imperial overhead despite the military seeking to continue rule in the region for an indefinite period.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Sultan will abide by the terms of the national constitution, which had several enforced compromises he was reportedly dissatisfied with."
krg_nbr_news.1.a: "How curious."

krg_nbr_news.2.t: "Abortive Handover of North Borneo leads to unrest"
krg_nbr_news.2.d: "Reports are coming in that after a fractuous national convention and apparent back and forth with the Sultan of Brunei, the Japanese Protectorate of North Borneo has fallen into a state of unrest as General Moritake Tanabe refused to relinquish control to the any of the various factions seeking home-rule in the region.\n\nThis news is unsurprising to some observers, who believed the Japanese intended on direct military rule in the region for an indefinite period, but other commentators are stating it may be the end of the relative calm seen in North Borneo by this direct veto of an attempted peaceful change."
krg_nbr_news.2.a: "Asia for the Japanese perhaps."

krg_nbr_news.3.t: "Sultan of Brunei beats Coupsters!"
krg_nbr_news.3.d: "It has come to the attention of the international press that the Sultanate of Brunei, one of the worlds smallest and more oil rich countries, has recently undergone a period of unrest that culminated in an attempted storming of the Sultan's Palace in Brunei Town.\n\nUnfortunately for the would be coupsters, the Sultan's guards were more than ready for an attack and successfully repelled the assault, killing several key figures in the rebel movement and chasing them out of the city entirely.\n\nThe coup attempt came after the Sultan rewrote the Constitution to give himself absolute power and to enshrine Islam as a state religion, infuriating many sectors of society."
krg_nbr_news.3.a: "How barbaric."

krg_nbr_news.4.t: "North Borneo Republic Declared!"
krg_nbr_news.4.d: "It has come to the attention of the international press that the Sultanate of Brunei, one of the worlds smallest and more oil rich countries, has recently undergone a period of unrest that culminated in a storming of the Sultan's Palace in Brunei Town.\n\nThe forces were led by the Parti Rakyat Borneo Utara (North Borneo People's Party) who successfully overcame the Sultan's guards and captured the Sultan sleeping in his bed. He is now under house-arrest in the Palace while the Republic movement go about organising a government.\n\nThe coup d'état came after the Sultan rewrote the Constitution to give himself absolute power and to enshrine Islam as a state religion, infuriating many sectors of society. [NBR.GetLeader] has stated there is no intention to leave the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but rather to enforce the agreed constitutional order."
krg_nbr_news.4.a: "Wild times in Borneo."

krg_nbr_news.5.t: "Formation of Malaysia"
krg_nbr_news.5.d: "With the recent overthrow of the Bruneian Sultanate, several voices in the new government sent out feelers to see if Japan and Malaya would approve a union of North Borneo with their cultural brethren on the Malay Peninsula. With the official announcement of the formation of the Malaysian Federation by Kuala Lumpur, one can be certain their probe was successful!\n\nThe world welcomes its newest nation today on [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]."
krg_nbr_news.5.a: "Good luck with that!"

krg_nbr_news.6.t: "North Borneo Unites with Insulindia"
krg_nbr_news.6.d: "With the recent overthrow of the Bruneian Sultanate, several voices in the new government sent out feelers to see if Japan and Insulindia would approve a union of North Borneo with their cultural brethren on the rest of the island of Borneo. With this news that Insulidindian troops crossed the border and manned stations and offices inside the former Republic of North Borneo, it appears that the matter has been decisively settled in Insulindia's favour.\n\nMany commentators are expressing surprise that Japan has permitted such a merger, given the potential regional counterweight and leadership capital the Insulindian government provides as a comparison point to Japan in South East Asia and the Islands."
krg_nbr_news.6.a: "Dangerous games afoot."
