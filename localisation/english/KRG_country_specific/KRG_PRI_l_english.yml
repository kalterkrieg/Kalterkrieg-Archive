### ideas ###
 PRI_Borinquen_Libre: "Borinquen Libre"
 PRI_Borinquen_Libre_desc: "For nearly four and a half centuries, Puerto Rico has been under one master or another: for four hundred years, the Spanish, and for just under forty years, the Americans. However, at last, Puerto Rico does not dance to the tune of some foreign city or army, but rather, charts its own path. Though its people may bicker and argue over where to take their newfound freedom, the island nation can find common unity in one fact: that their destiny is their own, and that none will take it from them again."
 PRI_The_Newfound_Democracy: "The Newfound Democracy"
 PRI_The_Newfound_Democracy_desc: "Despite the democratic institutions nominally established by the United States during Puerto Rico's time as an American colony, the collapse of American rule and the establishment of the Republic saw the complete upending of the party system traditionally found in the country. While the Partido Popular Democrático, led by the popular Luis Muñoz Marín, has come to rule the country through free and fair elections thus far, some are concerned that should this trend of single-party rulership continue, the relatively new Puerto Rican independent democracy could become something more resembling their 'democratic' neighbors."
 PRI_Manos_A_La_Obra: "Manos a La Obra"
 PRI_Manos_A_La_Obra_desc: "So-named for the rallying cry of those working on the various projects around the island, "Manos a la Obra" represents both the highest hopes and deepest criticisms of the ruling PPD government. Originally envisioned in the 1920s, this policy of government projects and rapid development of underdeveloped regions has sought to bring Puerto Rico from an island of sugar plantations and agriculture into the modern age. These programs have seen decent success thus far, though the traditional tourist and agricultural sectors have suffered from the lack of investment, and some have expressed their discontent at the consistent prioritization of the development of domestic industry rather than a movement towards greater trade with abroad."
 PRI_Legacy_of_the_Americans: "Legacy of the Americans"
 PRI_Legacy_of_the_Americans_desc: "The Puerto Rican Armed Forces draws its legacy as a professional fighting force from exactly one place: the United States of America. Most of its officers, particularly those above the lowest of ranks, once held positions in this organization, and the rank and unit structure for professional units are almost wholesale copied from the former Puerto Rican National Guard and United States Armed Forces. While some units, particularly those drawn from militia and ad hoc formations, maintain a degree of independent heritage, the legacy of American colonialism can most be felt in its military. While young officers, both Amerophile and Nationalist, seem intent on reforming the military to find new footing and a new basis for existence, it remains a well-known fact that any such reforms will struggle in the face of a budget and structure intent on keeping this old heritage for as long as possible."

 POLITICS_LUIS_MUNOZ_MARIN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nFebruary 18th, 1898\nOld San Juan, Captaincy General of Puerto Rico\n§W--------------§!\nBorn before the American takeover of the island, Luis Muñoz Marín represents the newest generation of Puerto Rican freedom fighters. The son of Luis Muñoz Rivera, a poet turned Resident Commissioner, and Amalia Marín Castilla, Muñoz Marín was raised on the ideas of Puerto Rican independence. Descending from a long line of loyal subjects to the Spanish Crown, this same sense of duty and fielty now fills his heart with one goal in mind to ensure the independence of his homeland. After attending Georgetown University for a brief stint, he became uninterested and instead chose to become a poet in New York City. \n\nFollowing the Declaration of Independence, Muñoz Marín was selected to serve as interim president of Puerto Rico by the Revolutionary Council until an election date could be set and international recognition was formalized. Now with the first elections on the horizon, Muñoz Marín must campaign against the popular Pedro Albizu Campos and his Puerto Rican Nationalist faction with his own Liberal-Democratic Faction with its message of prosperity and allying with the Canadian giant up north. Only time will tell what the people decide, but until then, Muñoz Marín will try as hard as he must to be enshrined as a founding father for the nation he and his family have sacrificed so much for."
