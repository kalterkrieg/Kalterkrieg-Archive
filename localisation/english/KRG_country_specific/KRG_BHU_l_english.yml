 POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 2nd, 1928\nThruepang Palace, Bhutan\n§W--------------§!\nBorn to the palace, Jigme Dorji has been brought up to be a Bhutanese Monarch by his father, and a good man by his mother. He has strived to be both, whilst also developing an interest in modernising the nation as a panacea for the backwardness and poverty that stalks it.\n\nWar has been the backdrop to his life, the Second Weltkrieg swirled and the Indian theatre pushing his ascent to the throne as his father died of heart issues a few years prior to the end of the war.\n\nWell travelled, and since his father's last health scare, increasingly well prepared to rule, Jigme Dorji looks to be setting Bhutan on a course that is determinably pointed toward a modern and bright future, through solicited aid packages. He seeks to preserve his nation's culture, and bring it into a modern state."
