HAW_major_influence_category: "The Hawaiian Mandate"
HAW_major_influence_category_desc: "Owing to the unique circumstances of the Hawaiian Mandate, various governments and interest groups vie for power to ensure a variety of things. Some merely desire riches, others desire political tools and power, and some... some desire the ultimate prize of control of the Islands themselves. Each of these interest groups can be defined into several broad categories, these categories themselves subdivided into several groups which all have their own interests. Mandate Stability represents the level of overall stability present in Hawaiian society and the Mandate Government— were it to drop too low, the consequences could be dire. However, it would also provide an opportunity for interested parties to make more §Rradical shifts§! in the future of the Mandate.\n\nMandate Stability: §Y[?HAW.stability|%0]§!\n\nThe Mandate Government\n§gMandate Government Influence§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@authoritarian_democrat|%1]\n§pMandate Constabulary Influence§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@paternal_autocrat|%1]\n\nThe Americans\n§OAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Honolulu§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@social_liberal|%1]\n§CHawaiian Liberation Front§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@revolutionary_republican|%1]\n§SHawaiian Federation of Labor§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@social_democrat|%1]\n\nThe Japanese\n§IHonolulu Nihonjin Shōkō Kaigi-sho (Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce)§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@market_liberal|%1]\n§rHonolulu Kōeki-dantai (Honolulu Special Interest Organization)§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@national_populist|%1]\n\nThe Canadians\n§BBritish Consulate in Honolulu§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@social_conservative|%1]\n\nThe Revolutionaries\n§RInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@radical_socialist|%1]\n§AHawaiian Socialist Party§!: [?HAW.party_popularity@authoritarian_socialist|%1]"

HAW_About_The_Factions: "Hawaiian Mandate Explanation"

HAW_influence.0.t: "Hawaiian Mandate Explanation"
HAW_influence.0.d: "The Hawaiian Mandate is a product of agreements made at cannon-point and compromises reached from the position of the brink of war, a true testament to the idea that 'nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution'. When the Second American Civil War kicked off, the island chain was largely left adrift in the broader politics of the region, with the majority of the politically-minded either heading to the PSA with the vast majority of the Pacific Fleet or choosing to find passage to their preferred combatant. Any attempts at domestic political action were smothered when the Japanese came, bringing their large fleets and troops to replace the recently-departed Americans and add Hawaii to their empire. However, things would not turn in favor of the Japanese, as three things conspired to bring an end to their short-lived conquest. The first of these would be the war in China, a costly and ultimately failed endeavor which brought resources and attention far away from the imperial state-building in Hawaii. The second of these would be the Hawaiians themselves, many of which were rather happy under the American government— or at the very least happier, as the Americans did not rule them with an effective military junta and only slight concessions to the sizeable American population (to say nothing of the native Hawaiians). The third issue that the Japanese faced is one which, in hindsight, they reasonably should have expected— the old owners and their new Canadian friend."
HAW_influence.0.a: "So what happened next?"
HAW_influence.0.b: "Can you just skip to the end?"
HAW_influence.0.c: "Bah, history bores me. Bye."

HAW_influence.1.t: "Hawaiian Mandate Explanation, Part 2"
HAW_influence.1.d: "When the warships of Canada arrived in Hawaii alongside several vessels of the Pacific States, it was predicted by many of the citizens of the island chain that war would begin, and that they would be in the crosshairs. However, when word finally came from the occupation authorities as to the ultimate fate of what was going to happen, the news was different than nearly any had anticipated: the Japanese garrison would be stepping down. An agreement had been hashed out in secret by which the Japanese and the two powers, negotiated through Cordell Hull on behalf of the Pacific States, would set up a 'Hawaiian Mandate', a government that would be entrusted to manage and govern Hawaii with the interests of all three powers at heart. Of course, the leader of such a government would need to be American to secure the support of the still largely American middle- and upper-classes, and Cordell Hull himself was put forward for such a position. The rest of the bureaucracy would be theoretically shared with the other powers, though de facto be primarily made up of Americans and Japanese, and a complex system of interest groups and governmental bureaus would handle the day-to-day affairs of Hawaii. A perfect system..."
HAW_influence.1.a: "...in theory."
HAW_influence.1.b: "...which never needs to be looked at. I'm sure it's fine."

HAW_influence.2.t: "The Factions of Hawaii (Part 3)"
HAW_influence.2.d: "Hawaii's Mandate is a complex web of interconnected lobbying groups, formal organizations, and shadowy networks, all finding a way to advance their own interests. These groups can generally be said to be balancers of one another, though it is an unstated rule that each desires to cement their own power and influence if they had the chance to seize it.\nThe Mandate Government: Controlled by Mandate Commissioner Cordell Hull, the §gMandate Government§! is the closest thing to a 'neutral organization' that exists in Hawaii— though even that is a misnomer. Its staff and policing force in the §pMandate Constabulary§! are largely American, and it is far more easily swayed by American interests than that of others.\n\nThe Americans: The Americans broadly represent the interests of the pre-Mandate American population on the island of Hawaii— and as a result, are split on a variety of issues. The main organization representing the Americans in the halls of commerce is the §OAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Honolulu§!, an association of American businesses. However, labor unions and anti-Mandate factions outside of the radical fringe are also fairly pro-American (often led by Americans), with the §SHawaiian Federation of Labor§! and §CHawaiian Liberation Front§! chief among them.\n\nThe Japanese: The Japanese are the newer group in Hawaii, though much of their influence stretches back several decades. The legal and 'upstanding' side of this coin is the §YHonolulu Nihonjin Shōkō Kaigi-sho§!, or the §YHonolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce§!, a collection of Japanese businessmen in connection with Mainland Japan in a symbiotic relationship. The less-than-legal side of this coin is the misleadingly-named §rHonolulu Kōeki-dantai§!, or §rHonolulu Special Interest Organization§!, an underground network of criminal activity and smuggling led by a mix of fanatics and mainland shady dealers.\n\nThe Canadians: The Canadians are the least influential of the Big Three, primarily focused on trade and market share than actual control of the island. Their sole point of influence is the §BBritish Consulate in Honolulu§!, an organization of Canadian and broader Anglosphere expatriates who seek to advance both their cause and the cause of Britain, all while making some money on the side.\n\nThe Revolutionaries: Simply because the global revolution has come and gone does not mean revolutionary fervor is dead in Hawaii. The §RInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union§!, a major labor union of sea workers, alongside its more radical political cousin in the §AHawaiian Socialist Party§! seek to establish a Hawaii far different from the vices of the other organizations, one where the workers rule— and their revolution brews in the background.\n\nOf course, politics and business can both be absolutely cutthroat, and if things come to it, new alliances may be broken or formed as necessary... because in Hawaii, the one rule is to look out for yourself."
HAW_influence.2.a: "Thanks for the tips."
HAW_influence.2.b: "Wait, I skipped ahead..."

HAW_outcomes.1.t: "Hawaii Requests American Accession"
HAW_outcomes.1.d: "Following a successful referendum in the former Hawaiian International Mandate, pro-American groups have managed to secure a majority of representation in the new provisional government in Hawaii and have formally requested the annexation of Hawaii into the Pacific States of America, which they see as the rightful representative of the moribund United States. While the past few years have been marred by political violence and infighting between the various powers in Hawaii, international observers declared this victory to be mostly free and fair, with pro-American groups winning over enough of the population to claim victory.\n\nPresident [CAL.SittingPresident] has already congratulated the people of Hawaii for their decision to 'rejoin' America following this contested election period, and debates are already ongoing as to what exactly the return of Hawaii to the American fold will look like. Whatever happens, though, it appears that the Americans have proven that the end of their rule over the Hawaiian islands was only a momentary blip in a longer period."

While the past few years have been marred by political violence and infighting between the various powers in Hawaii, international observers declared this victory to be mostly free and fair, with pro-Accordist and Republican groups winning over enough of the population to claim victory.\n\nAccordist politicians celebrated this victory as a triumph for their diplomatic bloc and welcomed this new state into their bloc as pro-American and Indepentist groups alike agreed to form political parties to attempt to pressure this new, democratic system.

HAW_Hawaiian_Revolution_Imminent_desc: "Despite the best efforts of the Mandate Government, the worst has come to pass— or at least, is rapidly approaching. With rioting in the streets, mass strikes among labor in the various plantations and shipyards of Hawaii, and ongoing internal wars between various factions of the Mandate Government, things are only destabilizing futher. If the situation is not rapidly resolved, the situation in Hawaii may be §Rirrevocably changed...§!"

HAW_Hawaiian_Referendum_Imminent_desc: "With stability at what can largely be considered a peak in the long history of the Mandate and business booming in the industrial sectors of Hawaii, the Mandate Government has declared that a referendum on the more permanent fate of the Hawaiian Islands is in order. For some, this is an opportunity to see their influence solidified, while for others, it holds significant potential to disrupt their business on the islands. However, delaying the Referendum would require a significant event, one which would cause unrest in the previously pristine isles."

HAW_CAL_Send_Constables_desc: "The situation in Hawaii appears worrying. A small force of volunteers from both the expatriate community and the mainland Pacific States will be sent to bolster the Constabulary force in order to assist in maintaining order. Any benefits our civilian friends in Hawaii receive is purely coincidental."
HAW_CAL_Send_Bureaucrats: "Send Bureaucrats to Hawaii"
HAW_CAL_Send_Bureaucrats_desc: "The Hawaiian bureaucracy, as a necessity of its situation, is overworked and underfunded. To assist in remedying this, we will send over some retired members of our own bureaucracy, who can aid in filling the holes presently within the Hawaiian bureaucracy. If decisions they make tend to benefit Americans more than any other group, we are sure that it is just an isolated incident."
HAW_CAL_Prioritize_Hawaiian_American_Business: "Prioritize Hawaiian-American Business"
HAW_CAL_Prioritize_Hawaiian_American_Business_desc: "In coordination with the American Chamber of Commerce in Honolulu, we will grant special privileges to American businesses operating in Hawaii. While this may cause us to suffer in the short-term, the business gained from additional American-owned businesses in Hawaii can be considered to be worth the costs."
HAW_CAL_Support_Hawaiian_Resistance_Groups: "Support Hawaiian Resistance Groups"
HAW_CAL_Support_Hawaiian_Resistance_Groups_desc: "As much as we may publicly decry the various resistance organizations in Hawaii, the truth is that we do indeed have our hands in them. Both the Hawaiian Liberation Front and Hawaiian Federation of Labor are useful tools by which we can make our voices heard in Hawaiian society, and as such, supplying them will assist us provided we are not discovered."

HAW_JAP_Increase_Consular_Police_desc: "While we are not allowed to send formal military forces to Hawaii, per the terms of the Mandate, we are allowed to send a detachment of 'consular police' to both protect our formal interests in the region as well as handle matters concerning Japanese citizens. Were a critical shortage to be discovered in terms of manpower and equipment, we could deploy these forces to assist the Mandate Constabulary in matters pertaining to Japanese citizens."
HAW_JAP_Expand_The_Shipping_Office: "Expand the Shipping Exchange"
HAW_JAP_Expand_The_Shipping_Office_desc: "The Honolulu Nippon Kaiun Shūkaijo, or Honolulu Japan Shipping Exchange, possesses a disproportionate amount of influence to its supposed standing wtihin the Mandate Government. If its staff is expanded, it could allow further shipping from Japan to reach Hawaii, thus increasing our influence over their government while also solidifying the current trade agreements."
HAW_JAP_Prioritize_Hawaiian_Business_Ventures: "Prioritize Hawaiian Business Ventures"
HAW_JAP_Prioritize_Hawaiian_Business_Ventures_desc: "In coordination with our Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, the government will approve a measure of funds to be given to assist in developing Japanese-run businesses. While some so-called 'financial experts' may call what we are doing irresponsible in our current time of crisis, we know that in the long run this will bear fruit."
HAW_JAP_Cut_A_Deal: "Cut a Deal with the Kōedan"
HAW_JAP_Cut_A_Deal_desc: "Despite some internal misgivings about the nature of Ryoichi Sakasawa's endeavors in Hawaii, one thing is clear: the man knows how to get things done. If we cut a deal with him to expand his influence while we look the other way at some of his more shadier dealings, we can gain significantly in our influence in Hawaii. All it may cost is a bit of political clout and stability, as well as perhaps our souls."

HAW_CAN_Deploy_Municipal_Police: "Deploy Municipal Police"
HAW_CAN_Deploy_Municipal_Police_desc: "Similarly to our former concession in Shanghai, we are able to deploy municipal police to aid the Mandate Government in enforcing its rulings within the territories of the Mandate. As it appears that the Constabulary is struggling to enforce the rule of law, we will deploy volunteers from across the Empire to assist it, as well as represent the interests of our citizens inside the Constabulary proper."
HAW_CAN_Employ_Increased_Foreign_Officers: "Employ Increased Foreign Officers"
HAW_CAN_Employ_Increased_Foreign_Officers_desc: "Our Foreign Office in Honolulu, the British Consulate, requires additional staff to better conduct their affairs. We will grant their request, hopefully allowing us to expand our operations within the island chain."
HAW_CAN_Encourage_Hawaiian_Investment: "Encourage Hawaiian Investment"
HAW_CAN_Encourage_Hawaiian_Investment_desc: "Many businesses of our Empire seem to be struggling to regain their footing given the large amount of volatile territory recently gained. We will encourage them to seek ventures in Hawaii, an area which can act as a base for their further expansion. While this may harm our efforts in the short-term, the influence gained will assist in ensuring long-term viability."
