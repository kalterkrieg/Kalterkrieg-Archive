### Ideas ###
RUS_economic_crisis: "Deepening Economic Crisis"
RUS_economic_crisis_desc: "Who knew that investing most of our resources into a failed war would end so badly? Though our war-time industry seemed strong, demobilisation has shattered our economic delusions. We have been rapidly engulfed with every economic crisis under the sun - inflation, debt, unemployment. The focus on military projects has left us a nation where a razorblades are a valued commodity, we have no shoes for our children and the food situation is such that rationing will have to continue for some time yet."
RUS_suspicious_officer_activity: "Suspicious Officer Activity"
RUS_suspicious_officer_activity_desc: "The decaying health of the Vozhd, while a state secret, is a common rumour amongst the military apparatus. Officers often go AWOL and some are reportedly in dining halls shrouded in secrecy. These officers are unknown but they are vast in number. As such, once the clock strikes midnight for the Vozhd, the true colour and loyalty of our general staff will be revealed..."
RUS_nuclear_obsession: "Nuclear Obsession"
RUS_nuclear_obsession_desc: "The Atom is a source of many things - a source of power, a source of destruction, but for our Vozhd, a source of obsession. Once the Kaiserreich reigned terror in the city of Portsmouth, the Vozhd was determined that such a weapon must be in Russia's hands. No matter how much money or blood we shall spend, the Vozhd demands the power of the atom be wielded in Moscow's hands."
RUS_belligerent_nation: "Belligerent Nation"
RUS_belligerent_nation_desc: "Russia has no friends, only enemies. If we want something, military action is the only rule of engagement. Diplomacy? It is not a word in our vocabulary. As such, the world fears and distrusts Russia, unwilling or outright refusing to negotiate and cutting us off from useful resources. But in our isolation there is strength, and the time will come when the world shall bow before us."
RUS_true_russia: "The True Russia"
RUS_true_russia_desc: "The Defence Council of the Revolutionary Army is here to save Russia from the failed legacy of Savinkovism. The True Russia will now come forth from beneath the discredited ideology of National Populism and will be renewed by the diligent application of labour by its many peoples."
RUS_western_resistance: "Western Resistance"
RUS_western_resistance_desc: "After many long years of struggle, territories belonging to the former Russian Empire have now been reclaimed under our banner. However, not everyone in these territories wish to be a part of our great nation. Ukrainians and Belorussians still violently struggle against our government, ranging from general strikes to guerilla attacks. These violent nationalists must be dealt with if we are to properly rebuild their homes."
RUS_Defeatism_Epidemic_1: "Epidemic of Defeatism"
RUS_Defeatism_Epidemic_1_desc: "Defeatism is a sickness of mind and body, that has crippled our armies and lead to the disaster in the West. Defeatism destroyed the armies of Russia in the Great Patriotic War, and now defeatism threatens to destroy the great nation of Russia. This sickness needs a doctor. It must be cured."

RUS_sacred_war_protests_desc: "In the wake of Vozhd Boris Savinkov's 'Sacred War Speech', the war-weary people of Russia have begun protesting against a resumption of hostilities between Moscow and Berlin. In every major Russian City, from the Black Sea to Siberia, veterans of the Great Patriotic War and their families are rallying against Savinkov's apparent madness. If these defeatists cant be crushed soon, then the Vozhd could be in danger!"
RUS_the_succession_crisis: "The Succession Crisis"
RUS_the_succession_crisis_desc: "Vozhd Boris Savinkov's death during a national emergency has sent the Russian State into chaos. Savinkovists, Revolutionary-Democrats and Militarist Generals are all vying for power, putting us on the verge of a total civil war. With the Kremlin's central authority shot to pieces, seperatist movements spawning across our great nation and mass movements trying to undermine our glorious nation, the next few months will be some of the most violent and chaotic Russia has seen since the outbreak of the Civil War.

### National Focuses ###

RUS_vozhdnewyears: "The Vozhd's New Year Speech"
RUS_vozhdnewyears_desc: "As the New Year dawns over Russia, her people wait for the words of the Vozhd. The recent ceasefire in the Great Patriotic War has put the Russian People in a state of weariness. The Vozhd's New Year Speech should rectify that, and set Russia back onto her proper course."
RUS_Rebuild_the_nation: "Rebuild the Nation"
RUS_Rebuild_the_nation_desc: "Many population centers in Russia still remain in ruin as a result of the Great Patriotic War. The ceasefire presents the Vozhd and Russia with an oppurtunity to rearm and rebuild, and to be prepared…"
RUS_Lessons_from_the_patriotic_war: "Lessons from the Patriotic War"
RUS_Lessons_from_the_patriotic_war_desc: "Eight Million men perished to free the Russian people from German rule over lands stolen from us with Brest-Litovsk. We will remember the losses in their quest to free all the Russias, but their sacrifice may be used to better train our man, and minimize the culling of Russia's Sons."
RUS_Project_Varangian: "Project Varangian"
RUS_Project_Varangian_desc: "The perfidious Teutons have seized the means of true devastation, and by deploying the atom against their foes in Britain they have shown their mastery of warfare.\n\nThis will not stand. We must pour all of our energies into gaining the means to create our own atomic weapons."
RUS_Our_Reclaimed_Land: "Our Reclaimed Land"
RUS_Our_Reclaimed_Land_desc: "Russia bleeds, but she has at least had some success in this war we have fought. We have regained some lands since 1936. Not as many as we would wish, but still. We should put our attention to them."
RUS_Focus_Belarus: "Focus on Belorussia"
RUS_Focus_Belarus_desc: "Flat, marshy Belorussia sits at the heart of our thrust into the German puppet regimes of their Eastern Wall. We knocked them down and brought them to heal. Now we should renew the lands, that we have split so much blood for."
RUS_Develop_Ukraine: "Develop the Ukraine"
RUS_Develop_Ukraine_desc: "The Ukraine is Russia's breadbasket, the Little Russia to Moscow's Great Russia. We should rebind the land to us, and remind the people there of their enduring brotherhood with Russia, developing them from the backwardness of the Cossack over the border."
RUS_Fuck_Ukraine: "Resettlement Incentives to the Ukraine"
RUS_Fuck_Ukraine_desc: "Development in the Ukraine will need reliable managers who can be trusted to take orders from Moscow. And the land cries out for workers. So we will encourage our people to move into the new lands, and help develop them."
RUS_Belarus_Corporations: "Assimilate Belarussian Corporations"
RUS_Belarus_Corporations_desc: "The inefficiency and inadequate scope of Belorussia's paltry infrastructure truly demonstrates how the nation was treated as a German puppet. Now White Russians will be able to work in enterprises that have true meaning and scale."
RUS_Bridgingthegap: "Bridging the Gap"
RUS_Bridgingthegap_desc: "The area between Little Russia and White Russia is historically a marshy, miserable place. We should improve the roads, so that our forces can transfer between points along the ceasefire line without too much congestion or trouble"
RUS_Rebuild_Ukranian_Industry: "Rebuild Ukrainian Industry"
RUS_Rebuild_Ukranian_Industry_desc: "The shattered ruins of factories stand along the river Dniepr in East Kiev, and behind them in Poltava and Kharkov. We should regenerate them, in order to ameliorate the economic pain we suffer trying to hold them up."

RUS_Yeet_Ukrainians: "Undermine The Ukrainian Farmers"
RUS_Yeet_Ukrainians_desc: "We have found that the Ukrainian Farmers are with-holding portions of their quota, because they're able to hide and move it around the back-country roads and avoid the main highways. By expanding the road networks we can resolve that problem, and increased access will help troop movements too."
RUS_Reinforcing_the_Dniper: "Reinforcing the Dnieper"
RUS_Reinforcing_the_Dniper_desc: "The riverline has become the defacto ceasefire line. We should therefore reinforce and entrench positions there to blunt any blows by the vile Teuton when the Reclamation War is resumed in full. No doubt they will seek to strike against us as we launch our own assaults."
RUS_Promises_of_Autonomy: "Promises of Autonomy"
RUS_Promises_of_Autonomy_desc: "The White Russians are a people very alike, but not wholly alike us Great Russians. We will give Minsk a degree of autonomy within Russia so that they might better administer the region than waste our precious energy on dealing with them."
RUS_Encourage_Bilingualism: "Encourage Bilingualism"
RUS_Encourage_Bilingualism_desc: "Ukrainian is very alike to Russian, and it makes no sense for the people there to speak such a backward dialect. We will officially encourage Ukrainians to take up Russian, so that they might truly enjoy being part of the Russkiy Mir"
RUS_Reassure_Minorities_UKR: "Reassure our Loyal Minorities"
RUS_Reassure_Minorities_UKR_desc: "Those who stand aside and work with Great Russia will find themselves suitably rewarded. Their labours contribute to the shared glory of all of us. The Vozhd will ensure this is done."
RUS_Fortify_Crimea: "Crimean Coastal Batteries"
RUS_Fortify_Crimea_desc: "We will have no soft underbelly, no access to our breadbasket for the hard-eyed marines and sneaking frogmen. If the Turk lets the Teuton's pass the strait, there will be no re-enactment of the war of 1853."

RUS_Support_Ukranian_Farmers: "Support Ukrainian Farmers"
RUS_Support_Ukranian_Farmers_desc: "The Ukrainian Farmers will feed us all, with the right assistance. We will send tractors, fertiliser, and help to the fields so that this will be so."

RUS_Moscow_Forts_2: "Fortify Moscow"
RUS_Moscow_Forts_2_desc: "A true Russian, but more importantly, a true Savinkovist, would never avoid fighting those who dare defy the words of The Pale Horseman. Our capital shall be the very battlefield that the enemies of the Vozhd will perish. We will ring Moskva in further steel, and once more make it a rock upon which our foe's forces will shatter."
RUS_Show_No_Weakness: "Show No Weakness!"
RUS_Show_No_Weakness_desc: "The idea of weakness is disgusting, and showing it is what got the country into this mess. We will take every measure we can to ensure the perfidious Teutons have no idea what our real state is, and present the unbridled ferocity of Russia to the world."
RUS_Draft_Adjustments: "Draft the Youth"
RUS_Draft_Adjustments_desc: "A sixteen year old is perfectly capable of holding a rifle and wearing a uniform. Children are better on crew weapons like mortars. We should ensure that they are not denied the opportunity to serve in our armed forces, and grow strong there before we recommence our struggle in the west."
RUS_Elite_Volunteers: "Fund the ADV"
RUS_Elite_Volunteers_desc: "The Armiya Dlya Vozhdya (Army for the Vozhd) is a elite volunteer army created by our most fanatical citizens. A paramilitary outfit, they have primarily existed on scraps from the Army, which have been in short supply of late. So we will make the commitment to properly fund them and reward their passion for our nation, and their ideal to build our state."
RUS_Eternal_Mobilization: "Eternal Mobilization"
RUS_Eternal_Mobilization_desc: "Russia must stand as an armed camp, with her citizens eternally ready to march forth to repel her foes. Anything less has been proven to be an error in our judgement, time and again. History shows our foes are implacable. We must show them we are irrepressible."
RUS_The_Propoganda_War: "Lead the Propaganda War"
RUS_The_Propoganda_War_desc: "There are many in the world who are opposed to the Germans and the Reichspakt, but we will be the loudest voice against them and their imperialist ambitions against us all."
RUS_War_Games: "War Games on the Border"

RUS_Rearm_The_Military: "Re-Arm the Revolutionary Army"
RUS_Rearm_The_Military_desc: "Our soldiers did not fail due to some incapacity of will or training. They failed because they had insufficient tools to get the job done! We will resolve the matter with the utmost urgency and then we will resume the war."
RUS_Corporate_Grants: "Corporate Grants"
RUS_Corporate_Grants_desc: "A healthy arms industry may need some prodding. A bit of capital to allow the seeds to flourish. We will provide disbursements from the state treasury, stretched as it is, in order to get the country ready to continue when the ceasefire expires."
RUS_Improve_Construction: "Improve Construction Capabilities"
RUS_Improve_Construction_desc: "The development of Materials Science in the Reclamation War era has led us to a better understanding of how to build large things, and many things, and most of all, more quickly. Now we should optimise and utilise these techniques."
RUS_Nuclear_Experiments: "Atomic Experiments"
RUS_Nuclear_Experiments_desc: "We hold the fury of the sun in our hand. Soon we will deliver it to our foes, and send them running from confrontation with us. Russia will be respected as the power she is, and we will reclaim our lost lands."
RUS_Expand_Science: "Direct the Labor Army"
RUS_Expand_Science_desc: "Scientists cannot perform their work in ramshackle laboratories. We will have the Labor Army build them facilities and cities to work in, to develop their art and to give us weapons of undreamed of power"

RUS_Seek_Scientists: "Seek New Scientists"
RUS_Seek_Scientists_desc: "Russia has many great minds, but our pursuit of this weapon will require every great mind. Even if that mind is in the body of a loyal minority, a woman, or a foreigner. The work is too important to be allowed to be delayed."
RUS_Fund_Nuke: "Divert Funding to the Izdeliye"
RUS_Fund_Nuke_desc: "The pragmatists say tanks and guns win wars. Nuclear weaponry will mean we shall just make demands and they will be fulfilled for fear of the war we would unleash!"
RUS_Closed_City_Experiments: "Closed City Experiments"
RUS_Closed_City_Experiments_desc: "The cities built by the Labor army for the scientists are now ready to conduct experiments in the nature of the atom. We will soon be ready to commence construction of wonder weapons."
RUS_University_Of_Moscow: "Expand the University of Moscow"
RUS_University_Of_Moscow_desc: "The hermit crab will abandon his home for a better, larger shell more suited to his mass. So too with the swelling mass of scientists and intellegentsia, we will need to provide them a larger home, that will facilitate their work."

### Subterfuge Tree
RUS_broadcasting_savinkov: "Broadcasting Savinkov"
RUS_broadcasting_savinkov_desc: "Simply telling the Old Man that we're running a campaign in the West won't satisfy him. We will have him give speeches on the radio, and to selected audiences, exhorting our brave soldiers to the front.\n\nOf course, the microphone to the radio will be dead, and the crowd will be professional actors who will cheer and bay for blood as needed."
RUS_falsifying_the_frontlines: "Falsifying The Frontlines"
RUS_falsifying_the_frontlines_desc: "Using the Stavka to wargame the events of a new campaign in the West, we can have them provide us with detailed maps and positions of armies, as well as neatly randomised setbacks and successes.\n\nThis way the war will seem like we are making some gains, without being so ludicrously successful that the Old Man might get it in his head to visit his new domain in the west just yet..."
RUS_further_setbacks: "Further Setbacks And Reverses"
RUS_further_setbacks_desc: "We should make sure that the war seems like it is not going too well. The Old Man asks for news twice, even three times a day. We have to make sure he doesn't get it in his head to go to the front.\n\nBut he is already questioning his health and ability to lead this war. Perhaps soon we will be able to convince him to step back completely."
RUS_decorate_our_heros: "Decorate Our Brave Soldiers"
RUS_decorate_our_heros_desc: "Nothing makes the Old Man happier than pinning medals on soldiers. Nothing makes soldiers happier than getting medals they didn't have to run through machinegun fire and grenades for.\n\nRecently anyway. The armed forces of Russia have a surfeit of soldiers who deserve recognition, and we have actors who we can have play heroes to keep the old man entertained with war stories while the others get their overdue rewards."
RUS_russia_is_bleeding: "Russia is Bleeding!"
RUS_russia_is_bleeding_desc: "Even with favourable advantages the Stavka wargame has our paper war turning into another meatgrinder stalemate, and Russia is bleeding.\n\nWe can convince the Old Man with this tha this health is holding back the campaign, that he should step back from leading the war, and rest... so he can lead better.\n\nIdeally he will never come back from his break."

### Vulture Fascism Industrial Tree
RUS_Salvage_The_West: "Salvaging What We Can From The West"
RUS_Salvage_The_West_desc: "The western territories are lost to us, their minerals and manpower will be sooner than later signed away at the stroke of a pen. But what we can do is extract as much material and industrial capacity from the region, along with the workforce as needed and move it somewhere where we can exploit it longer, like beyond the Urals..."
RUS_Plunder_Donbass: "Plundering The Donbass"
RUS_Plunder_Donbass_desc: "The filthy beating heart of Ukrainian coal mining and subsequently steel production, we will rip out the steelworks and cart them east. The heavily industrialised region will provide us with machinetools, and other machineries and engines to keep Russia strong, even in defeat."
RUS_Plunder_Minsk: "Plundering Belorussia"
RUS_Plunder_Minsk_desc: "The industrialisation of Belarus by the Germans after their illegal seizure of land after the First Weltkrieg will provide us with plenty of material with which to build up and plot our return later."
RUS_smash_minority_organisations: "Smash Minority Resistance"
RUS_smash_minority_organisations_desc: "With our operation in the West now on the clock, we can stop pretending to care about uplifting these backwards Ukrainians, teaching them proper Russian or their children how to work in our factories. Their resistance organisatiosn will be destroyed, Partisans hung as awarning to overs, and the troops will be issued double ammunition. When we return, we will settle this land with true Russians."
RUS_relocate_loyalists: "Extract Loyalist Officials"
RUS_relocate_loyalists_desc: "Not all Ukrainians and Belorussians are idiots. Some of them are useful idiots. We will ensure they and their families are extracted east along with the industry and resources. They might come in useful for collaboration governments later."
RUS_send_workers_east: "Send Workers East"
RUS_send_workers_east_desc: "All these factories need workers! We will take the employment rolls from the factories and collect the skilled lavorers who are still present. Then we will be able to have them train our people, and help replenish our war-losses."
RUS_ensure_good_behaviour: "Ensure Good Behaviour"
RUS_ensure_good_behaviour_desc: "We will take care of the families of the new workforce, in special housing facilities they can visit when they are not at the factory. So their families are safely guarded by good, strong Russian soldiers."
RUS_expand_prison_system: "Expand the Lagerya Truda"
RUS_expand_prison_system_desc: "With the continuation of war measures, there has been a spike of hooliganism and other criminality. We will need to expand the labor camps to control this swell in lawlessness. And it will also help us extract more material from the country. How convenient."
RUS_expand_ural_factories: "Develop Industry Beyond The Urals"
RUS_expand_ural_factories_desc: "The new factories in the East will provide a basis for further development. We will expand so we are ready for the future, because even if the war is not now, it will be again."
RUS_extract_in_the_north: "Expand Extraction In The North And Siberia"
RUS_extract_in_the_north_desc: "We can use the prison labor to expand existing mines and start new prospected ones in the North and Siberia, where it is nearly impossible to recruit workers otherwise."
RUS_develop_siberian_rail: "Develop Siberian Rail Connections"
RUS_develop_siberian_rail_desc: "The Siberian Railways could serve to be expanded and upgraded. Ironically this will facilitate further sending of workers to new Lagerya Truda. So they will build the steel track to their dooms."
RUS_zlatoust_industrial_zone: "Zlatoust Arsenal"
RUS_zlatoust_industrial_zone_desc: "The Zlatoust region received the lion's share of the Military Factories. We should go ahead and concentrate our effort on expanding this industrial combine, so we can innovate and develop in close quarters."
RUS_exploit_kolyma: "SevOst Lag"
RUS_exploit_kolyma_desc: "With the inauguration of the SevOst Lag we can exploit the Kolyma Region with additional labour from the prison system."
RUS_prioritise_factory_workers: "Prioritise Voluntary Economic Development"
RUS_prioritise_factory_workers_desc: "We have laid the groundwork for good economic development in Siberia through hard work of many. Now we should proceed without having to rely on prison labour. This will mean the economy here develops in a natural way, and will fulfil the state's needs."
RUS_expand_labor_pool: "Expand Prison Labour Pool"
RUS_expand_labor_pool_desc: "Why would we want to pay anyone when the majority of work here is extractive, hard labour. We should just find more prisoners and keep the ones we have working hard as possible."
RUS_crush_unions: "Crush Attempts To Organise Labour"
RUS_crush_unions_desc: "Wherever you get workers, sooner or later some idiot starts babbling about Syndicalism.\n\nThe trick is to have them killed as soon as possible, and shown to the others, to demonstrate what Syndicalism leads to!"
RUS_develop_interior: "Develop The Interior"
RUS_develop_interior_desc: "We are now able to further develop the interior after all the hard work that we have put into this venture!"
RUS_economic_recovery: "An Economic Recovery?"
RUS_economic_recovery_desc: "Fewer and fewer children play in the streets without shoes. Vehicles get repaired sooner rather than later, or never... Razor blades are no longer so impossible to find.\n\nWe may have, with the application of mountains of hard work, forced and otherwise, actually managed to pull the economy out of it's utter nosedive?"

### Troika 
RUS_troika_stands_tall: "The Troika Stands Tall!"
RUS_troika_stands_tall_desc: "With everyone in the highest echelon of power in agreement that Savinkov is a danger to himself and the country, the Troika can go ahead and focus on the business of rescuing the country without fear of the Vozhd interfering.\n\nThere is a chance they may even manage it."
RUS_Resume_Reclamation_2: "The Sacred War"
RUS_Resume_Reclamation_2_desc: "The old man's overriding desire is to send our soldiers east, and have them conquer all those places we did not conquer last time. Reclaim Ukraine, Reclaim Belarus. Take Konigsberg and burn Berlin for good measure. So we'll tell him that's exactly what they're trying to do. Of course, that won't ever leave this room.\n\nThere is historical precedent for the Tsar's advisors to keep him in the dark, and the Troika have the means to make sure nobody tells him that's exactly what they're doing..."
RUS_signing_a_treaty: "Signing A Treaty"
RUS_signing_a_treaty_desc: "With Savinkov squarely off the chessboard, the treaty can now be signed to handover the territories we had promised the Germans. While nobody likes this, and the people are not pleased by the idea of surrendering territory, we will at least have the Germans off our backs."
RUS_The_Treaty_Trial: "Prosecuting Those Responsible"
RUS_The_Treaty_Trial_desc: "Despite signing the treaty, we are not going to be the ones taking the fall for it. No... we will hold a trial to get to the root of the matter!"
RUS_blame_the_economy: "Blame The State Of The Economy"
RUS_blame_the_economy_desc: "The National-Socialist Five-Year Plan experiment has been a complete failure. Brezhnev's economic incompetence and bumbling prioritisation has caused the war to be lost by the immortal Russian State. Now he will hang for it."
RUS_blaming_the_archdefeatist: "Blaming The Enemy Within"
RUS_blaming_the_archdefeatist_desc: "The Arch-Defeatist in Chief set up the war to be a failure by default, planned from the very start, he fabricated the destruction of the state, beguiled poor Malinovsky and sent the nation to hell after convincing the Vozhd that the country could succeed when it was nowhere near ready."
RUS_increase_party_oversight: "Increase Party Oversight"
RUS_increase_party_oversight_desc: "The Failure of these organisations comes from a lack of sufficient party oversight. With more SZRS men in these organs we will be able to keep an eye on the civil servants working within. No longer will they conduct business under our noses."
RUS_purge_the_administrators: "Purge The State Administration"
RUS_purge_the_administrators_desc: "Brezhnev's failure might have been the most obvious case, but he was like a bushy-browed zit atop a festering cyst of pus beneath the skin of the nation. We will have to excise all the administrators who followed his orders, listened to his commands, and organised our failure to his tune."
RUS_purge_natsgvardia: "Purge The Natsgvardia's Rotten Core"
RUS_purge_natsgvardia_desc: "Gorgulov did not act alone, and while he was an adept and wicked manipulator of men, he was also aided by some of the worst scum to float to the top of the churning waters that Russia has become.\n\nNow we will scoop off the scum, and discard it."
RUS_Replacing_Shepilov: "Replacing Shepilov"
RUS_Replacing_Shepilov_desc: "Shepilov's Ideological Crusade against Revisionism and his effort to Codify the effort of Savinkovism has started to lead to him seeing himself as the Old Man's natural heir.\n\nHe is not strong enough yet to not be dislodged, so we will do just that, before he further solidifies his base."
RUS_renewed_ideological_requirements: "Renewed Ideological Requirements"
RUS_renewed_ideological_requirements_desc: "With the dethroning of Shepilov from his position of chief-arbiter of Savinkovism, we are going to have to require new ideological commitments to the National Populist Savinkovist concept from universities and soldiers alike.\n\nHowever, since the those ideological concepts are somewhat vaguer now the codification is disguarded under the pal of Shepilov's disgrace, people can pretty much believe what they want, as long as they believe in the SZRS in the process!"
RUS_Expand_Judiciary: "Expand The Judiciary"
RUS_Expand_Judiciary_desc: "We will need to have more judges to pass more sentences. Especially with the overthrow of the 'Shepilovist' clique, we can start preparing a new wave of prison labour projects."
RUS_secure_officers: "Secure Officer Loyalty"
RUS_secure_officers_desc: "During the Great Patriotic War, many of our skilled and cunning officers were either captured by the Germans, killed in action, or purged by the Old Man. In order to revitalize the tired and overworked recruits, the Troika has decided to take a different approach\n\nSeen as relics of Savinkov's insanity and paranoia, the Natsgvardia special tribunals shall be eliminated as a practice in the Army and a portion of the ideological restrictions put on them shall be lifted. As long as our brave soldiers defend the Motherland tooth and nail, they will have nothing to fear from the SZRS." 
RUS_power_sharing: "Power Sharing Measures"
RUS_power_sharing_desc: "The Troika, as the name suggests, is a triumvirate composed of the most powerful men in Russia, gathered in an attempt to prevent the catastrophe that looms over the motherland. In order to cement this "agreement", power sharing measures must be taken in order to prevent another Pale Horseman like Savinkov from rising during these tumultuous times." 
RUS_cement_troika_dominance: "Cement Troika Dominance"
RUS_cement_troika_dominance_desc: "Now that the measures have been put in place and loyal officers have been selected, the Troika shall begin carrying out its mission to once more cleanse Russia of the rot that infests it from within. \n\nHowever, it is obvious to all three men that this is only a temporary solution to a worsening problem. Only God knows how much time their love for Russia will keep them on the same page." 
RUS_draw_up_new_lists: "Draw Up New Lists"
RUS_draw_up_new_lists_desc: "There are people out there who over the years have crossed the Troika, whilst being protected by great deeds or the Old Man himself.\n\nThat time has ended. They will no longer be able to commit their transgressions freely, and their past is about to catch up with them."
RUS_no_mercy_for_traitors: "No Mercy for Traitors!"
RUS_no_mercy_for_traitors_desc: "With the security apparatus under control, we can start to remove those in the civilian sector who are culpable of aiding our opponents and replace them with our own people.\n\nWe will destroy corruption and treason where it is found, and leave nothing behind that is not good." 
RUS_liberate_the_peasants: "Liberate the Peasants"
RUS_liberate_the_peasants_desc: "The Peasantry were promised many great things, and indeed it seemed for awhile they would receive them. However of late the government has been too involved in it's own internal matters. We should instead be looking to make good on some of those promises and remind people why they have supported the SZRS despite the absence of the Vozhd..."
RUS_party_congress: "The 1952 Party Congress"
RUS_party_congress_desc: "The O.K. Corral has nothing on the show-down that's going to happen here.\n\nThe Troika have been circling one another for awhile now, but here with the lights on the stage, one man will take the pulpit and speak his vision to the nation. \n\nOne man, and one man alone. \n\nAnd that one man's ideas will be the future of the SZRS and the future of Savinkovism, and the end of the others. Dreams will be discarded back to the dust and ashes they arose from, and the world will keep on turning."
RUS_game_begins: "The Game Begins"
RUS_game_begins_desc: "The Troika had a mission, but now... they've achieved their goals. And so they start to look at one another in a different light. The Old Man is off the board. The Treaty has been signed and the patsy blamed.\n\nIt's time to take the knives out."
RUS_rallying_the_nation: "Rallying The Nation"
RUS_rallying_the_nation_desc: "The SZRS has been of late an absent steward to the interests of the Russian people. The Old Man might have been delusional but he was able to rile the people into baying crowds who barked for whatever he demanded. \n\nNow we have to once again call the Nation to our side, give them something to believe in and remind them that we are the only cause worth fighting for."
RUS_The_Support_Of_The_Army: "The Support Of The Army"
RUS_The_Support_Of_The_Army_desc: "An obscure Chinese thinker once said 'Political Power grows from the Barrel of a Gun'. It would therefore behoove us to further solidify our ties with the Army and it's representatives. \n\nFor while they are shaken by the purges, they should not now gain so much confidence with the fading of Savinkov's light that they might think to over throw the SZRS with the tacit support of the masses."
RUS_The_Support_Of_The_People: "Seeking Popular Support"
RUS_The_Support_Of_The_People_desc: "The Army will never move against the SZRS if the nation is one with it's leadership. They will in turn be influenced by their families and loved ones. \n\nWe must therefore seize the people's hearts and bring them into the warmth of our tender mercies."
RUS_reforge_the_national_character: "Reforging The Nation"
RUS_reforge_the_national_character_desc: "The National Character is backward, disoriented and disjointed. We are a nation that is the result of an imperial project of Muscovy, and without the monarchy of old, we are a rabble of peasants and farmers united only by the light of National Populism. \n\nWe will need a new kind of man to face the trials that come to Russia. We will forge a new man who is a Svobodnik by blood and breath and without doubt.\n\nAnd in turn the nation will change and the world will tremble..."
RUS_Sideline_Revisionists: "Sideline Revisionists"
RUS_Sideline_Revisionists_desc: "Half of these fools don't even truly understand or follow the words of our dear departed leader, the Vozhd. With such bumbling fools running amock, they are revising the immortal texts of Savinkovism as they see fit, bending a quote here, rewriting a line there.\n\nIt will not stand, and so we will relegate them to positions of impotence, where their inability to comprehend will not damage the fragile state of affairs."
RUS_Our_Loyal_Minorities: "The Peoples of Russia"
RUS_Our_Loyal_Minorities_desc: "Russia is not made up of just Russians. That would be too simple. But Savinkov had much love for 'Our Loyal Minorities' and with the right steps and management, we can perhaps provoke a love in their breast for the SZRS too.\n\nIf we can promote their interests (within reason) we can guarantee our state will last."
RUS_Russians_Above_All: "Russians Above All"
RUS_Russians_Above_All_desc: "All this Loyal Minorities talk is just another example of revisionist blathering that ignores the simple demographic fact that Russia is mostly populated by Russians. \n\nIf they want to live on some plains or in the taiga or on a damn freezing mountain, let them. But when they come to civilisation, they will be reminded who is in charge and the SZRS will not waste it's breath arguing otherwise."
RUS_Intellectual_Renaissance: "An Intellectual Renaissance?"
RUS_Intellectual_Renaissance_desc: "With relaxation of ideological requirements in universities and schools has proven to be surprisingly beneficial - people are arguing in the streets, talking more freely and actually coming up with ideas instead of meandering around from work to home and back again."
RUS_Korenizatsiya: "Korenizatsiya"
RUS_Korenizatsiya_desc: "Korenizatsiya (or nativisation) is the process by which those regions of the state that do not have ethnic majority of Russians, will be overseen by local officials of the regional majority ethnic group instead. This policy should  strengthen the country and unify them behind SZRS when they realise they have a common policy with the party."
RUS_Pacify_The_Caucasus: "Pacify The Caucasus"
RUS_Pacify_The_Caucasus_desc: "The Caucasian minorities are a restless, quarrelsome, violent bunch of reprobates and sheep-thieves. If we ever want a lasting peace in that region, we must scatter these people to the winds over the Kazakh steppe, which is much need of settlers for the farms."
RUS_expand_the_administration: "Expand The State Administration"
RUS_expand_the_administration_desc: "The nation cannot be managed with the scant information we receive from the regions.\n\nThe prison labour system is creaking under the weight of dealing with the masses employed gainfully in the camps.\n\nWe require additional adminstrators in order to impose upon and develop the nation in the correct way, before it collapses in on itself like a house of cards! Which means we will need to educate them."
RUS_guide_minorities: "Guiding Our Loyal Minorities"
RUS_guide_minorities_desc: "The lumpen, stumbling, muttering but Loyal Minorities are in need of taking care of by their Great Russian brothers. Their honest labours and strivings must be pushed into the correct path, so they do not revert to their agrarian folkways.\n\nThey might not appreciate this guidance, but it is always for their best interests."
RUS_shepilov_thought: "Shepilov Thought"
RUS_shepilov_thought_desc: "General Secretary Shepilov's efforts to codify and detail the Savinkovist position on... well practically everything, has left him in a unique position to interpret, calibrate and correct Savinkov's legacy. \n\nSome are even coming to use the term 'Shepilovist' position when discussing a matter of ideology."

## Gorgy
RUS_vozhd_gorgulov: "Vozhd Gorgulov?"
RUS_vozhd_gorgulov_desc: "Silence sweeps the Russian land. The Troika, the pretenders of Savinkov himself, have all been killed in a mysterious explosion that blew a massive hole in the side of the Kremlin Fortress and ruined several rooms and floors. The sole survivor of the highest level of civilian government after this incident is none other than the current leader of the Natsgvardia, Pavel Gorgulov who was attending to other business at the time.\n\nAs the sole survivor of this disaster, the chain of command has meant that Gorgulov has named himself the Vozhd. Now, with his hand firmly on the lever of power, Gorgulov shall enact his plans."
RUS_fortress_petrograd: "Fortress Petrograd"
RUS_fortress_petrograd_desc: "It is obvious that Vatutin and his cronies are opposed to the radicalism of the new Vozhd, and it would be a wise to choice to fortify the city of Petrograd. Moskva is sure to fall in this bloody conflict, so in order to have a better chance at defeating these heretics, we must form a defensive line deep within our territory, and let our supporters carry out the partisan warfare against the traitors of the KORA."
RUS_who_is_with_us: "Who Is With Us?"
RUS_who_is_with_us_desc: "It is an arduous task to find people who would work under, or perhaps hand in hand with our leader. Luckily for us, it is not an impossible one, as many politicians who had previously served Savinkov in the past seek to join our movement. One of them is a prominent member of the SZRS, named Ivan Serov, who has tasked himself with the utter destruction of the KORA and their degenerate views. Great minds think alike, after all."
RUS_do_or_die: "Do Or Die!"
RUS_do_or_die_desc: "Our frontlines are on the brink of collapse! The militant pigs have been putting up a strong enough fight, so much so that we are critically low on resources and ammunition. We need to remind our soliders why they are fighting, and the consequences of not doing so. Not ONE step backwards!"
RUS_In_His_Name: "In His Name"
RUS_In_His_Name_desc: "The man who lifted up Russia in her darkest hour was Boris Savinkov. The wretched parliamentarians and bolsheviks could not see through their own degeneracy, and such, only the Pale Horseman was left to save the nation. It seems that even the military has decided to unmask their grotesque faces against out shining martyr. This war is dedicated to you, our eternal Vozhd."
RUS_Move_The_Patriarch: "Bring The Patriarch to Petrograd"
RUS_Move_The_Patriarch_desc: "Legitimacy in Russia still has some tenuous threads to the Orthodox church. The Patriarch approved of the SZRS and has worked politically for the organisation for years. Publicly it is not acknowledged or spoken but he is actually a mid level member of the organisation, as the party's role in society is total. Therefore accordingly we should bring him from Moskva for the time being, to ensure his safety."
RUS_call_on_the_air_force: "Call On The Air Force"
RUS_call_on_the_air_force_desc: "While the KORA has the hearts and minds of the ground troops, the air forces have always had a rivalry with them and we can exploit that to bring them onto our side, and provide us with means to strike at our foes."
RUS_Naval_Infantry: "Naval Infantry Divisions"
RUS_Naval_Infantry_desc: "We have sailors sitting idle on their ships, while we have a war that needs men on the ground. So we will take the sailors and put them into the job, arming them with rifles and having them stood up as naval infantrymen."
RUS_Naval_Guns: "Take Guns Off The Ships"
RUS_Naval_Guns_desc: "Our navy is pointless, but the cannons that sit aboard those ships could serve as artillery or anti-tank guns at the front. So we will disassemble the weapons from their mounts and remount them on gun carriages."
RUS_Strike_First: "Strike First!"
RUS_Strike_First_desc: "We will not win this war by sitting on our thumbs! We must be bold, brave and aggressive Scythian warriors who will surge towards our foes and annihilate them. We will seek to encircle our foes and defeat them in detail."
RUS_dealing_with_KORA: "Dealing With The KORA"
RUS_dealing_with_KORA_desc: "The time has come to finally put the legacy of the rotten KORA out for all to see, and then destroy them. The Natsgvardia is the only armed force Russia has ever needed, and now we will overthrow those who opposed us from the start."
RUS_bleed_them_dry: "Bleed Them Dry!"
RUS_bleed_them_dry_desc: "The Scythian is bold and brave but he is also cunning and sneaky. The best way to deal with the foe is to walk him into traps, kill him in pre-ordained killing fields and destroy him in a measured fashion. Otherwise we run the risk of being reckless and wasteful."
RUS_lockdown_the_city: "Put Moscow In Lockdown"
RUS_lockdown_the_city_desc: "In this dire time that Russia finds herself in, her children must too bear the burden of war. As such, Moskva will be put under direct military occupation, in order to prevent another political assasination. Not that they would even dare to disagree with the Vozhd anyway."
RUS_police_battalions: "Call Up The Police"
RUS_police_battalions_desc: "The policemen of Moskva are sat in their homes and offices and waiting for martial law to be lifted. This is a waste of manpower that could be used to fight the KORA. We will mobilise the police battalions and have them help in our campaign to free Russia of the pernicious influence of Vatutin."
RUS_faith_and_nation: "Mobilise Faith And Nation Chapters"
RUS_faith_and_nation_desc: "The Faith and Nation organisation has been a key entry of the party into the Orthodox church and allowing the total integration of SZRS into society. These groups are religious but also militant, and we can exploit them as another source of troops to throw against the KORA."
RUS_penal_battalions: "Send In The Dregs!"
RUS_penal_battalions_desc: "The Prisons are full of petty criminals, politicals and other dregs of our society who serve no useful purpose aside from being a source of labour. We will form penal shock divisions, and have Natsgvardia behind them to force them forwards."
RUS_the_final_blows: "The Final Blows!"
RUS_the_final_blows_desc: "We have reached the point of victory, we need only go ahead and drop the final hammer shocks into the foe to shatter them completely and assure our success."
RUS_into_exile: "Flee Into Exile!"
RUS_into_exile_desc: "The KORA are at the gates, already our fortresses have fallen. There is no promise of glory anymore, men are deserting from our forces despite our desperate attempt to bring them into line... perhaps it is time to flee..."
RUS_a_decisive_blow: "A Decisive Blow!"
RUS_a_decisive_blow_desc: ""
RUS_onwards_russia_mother: "Onwards Mother Russia!"
RUS_onwards_russia_mother_desc: ""
RUS_onwards_russia_mother_2: "Onwards Mother Russia!"
RUS_onwards_russia_mother_2_desc: "With helmets on their head and guns close to their heart, Mother Russia's children shall defend her tooth and nail. Our nation has endured many catastrophes, such as the Russian Civil War during the first half of the twenieth century, which made our dear country bleed, and its people wail.\n\n But now, akin to a phoenix rising from its own ashes, Russia has been transformed from a fanatic, kleptocratic, and heinous one party state into a player on the world stage. May she one day stand again proudly in Kiev. Dlya Rossii-matushki!"

### KORA Militzary Tree ###

RUS_vozhd_vatutin: "Vozhd Vatutin"
RUS_vozhd_vatutin_desc: "Today is a day of celebration for all Russians around the world. The Troika, the tumorous and traitorous alliance formed out of personal interests and vendettas, has been removed from power. The exact details of the events remain somewhat a mystery to those who were not present in the Kremlin that day. What matters is that Marshal Nikolai Vatutin, has announced in a public speech that the armed forces were forming a government of National Salvation and remaining associates of the triumvirate were to be investigated under allegations of plotting against the Russian people and self-enrichment. Now taking the title of \"Vozhd\", Vatutin has temporarily placed the unstable regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia martial law of their military district commanders, as to avoid even more civil unrest."
RUS_moscow_under_military: "Moscow Under the Military"
RUS_moscow_under_military_desc: "Even though the military has things under control in most Russian cities, the situation in Moskva is quite different. Being at the center of the Savinkovist propaganda machine, a large number of citizens within the city still hold sympathies towards the old man and his corrupt successors. In order to prevent agitators from getting momentum, Moskva shall be placed under martial law until the situation is deemed stable. "
RUS_loyal_minorities: "The Loyal Minorities"
RUS_loyal_minorities_desc: "For some time now, the Caucasus and Central Asia have been directly governed by the local military districts that have been established by the KORA. Surprisingly, fruitful results emerged from this, as the restless areas full of insurgents have finally been silenced or at least mollified. It seems that reconstruction has paved the way for civilian life to continue as normal after their re-incorporation into the Russian state. "
RUS_redraw_military_districts: "Redraw Military Districts"
RUS_redraw_military_districts_desc: "After careful consideration and many, many meetings within Vatutin's inner circle, a decision was finally made. In order to end the Caucasian issue once and for all, a redrawing and reorganization of local districts must take place. The new and remodelled boundary lines will make sure that Russians are going to be an ethnic majority in all areas affected by agitators, so that our secret service will have an easier time wiping them out. "
RUS_military_minorities: "Military Minorities"
RUS_military_minorities_desc: "A tale as old as time in the Russian military is the use of minorities as a shock corps for our combat troops. Of course, this practice was carried out en masse during the Great Patriotic War, resulting in many villages losing a lot of their population as well as disproportionate veteran representation from survivors. During peace time, it would be wise to give special rights to minority divisions, in order to prevent any discontent from these veterans and the familiies of those who were lost. Additionally it provides us with the means to continue recruiting from this pool of manpower."
RUS_crush_natsgvardia: "Crush the Natsgvardia"
RUS_crush_natsgvardia_desc: "The Natsgvardia was formed by the old man in his time of delusion and insanity. It served as his own personal intelligence agency and guards, always having agents at his disposal. But now, after the cancerous government has been overthrown, it is time for the Natsgvardia and its employees to be excised like the unwanted tumours they are. Let them get a taste of their own twisted medicine."
RUS_disinformation: "The Disinformation Campaign"
RUS_disinformation_desc: "Perhaps one of the greatest feats of the old man were his propaganda campaigns. Who says that we can't use them as well? With technological advancements just around the corner, perhaps it is time to expand our ways to distribute misinformation and half-thruts in order to convince our population that our administration is not a lost cause. Movies celebrating the sacrifice of our fallen soldiers will be screened in Moskva as soon as the government can hire a competent and loyal filmmaker on our side."
RUS_examine_local_units: "Examine Local Units"
RUS_examine_local_units_desc: "In response to the removal of the Troika, several officers loyal to the successors of Savinkov have refused to follow our orders. It is vital that these agitators be removed from the military system all together. It doesn't matter if they are only a local garrison or a popular group within the town, all sympathizers of the Troika and their legacy will be trialled and promptly imprisoned or executed."
RUS_deal_with_regionalist_officers: "Deal With Regionalist Officers"
RUS_deal_with_regionalist_officers_desc: "Both the Transcaucasian and the Central Asian military districts have been proven to be quite effective tools in quelling the anger of the regional unruly mobs.  Konstantin Leselidze and Filip Panov have been given permission to continue the pacification campaigns. The central government will, as well, begin the extraction of natural resources from the regions, so as to gain the needed capital in order to fund the army."
RUS_remove_low_level_officials: "Remove Low Level Officials"
RUS_remove_low_level_officials_desc: "Saving a nation from an imminent collapse will always leave some people unhappy. Either because they never got the chance to explore their personal ideology, or because they fully endorsed the previous regime. Their opinions do not matter in the slightest however. All that matters to the government and army now is reconstruction and letting the nation grieve. Those that even think of opposing this system will simply get removed. There is no place in Russia for sabotuers."
RUS_arrest_politicians: "Arrest Zankevich"
RUS_arrest_politicians_desc: "Prominent Savinkovist Andrey Ivanovich Zankevich has just been arrested in the city of Yerevan, while attempting to cross the border into Iran. Having served as the minister of the interior under Boris Savinkov during the Great Patriotic War, he was deeply entangled with the secret service and the Natsgvardia, and signed many approvals for the purging innocent officers, arrest of war protesters and silencing the critics of Savinkov. Giving this vermin a trial would be too kind, but it might reassure the populace that we are fighting for them. Then, what should we do with this scum?"
RUS_increase_soldier_pensions: "Increase Soldier Pensions"
RUS_increase_soldier_pensions_desc: "Where was Savinkov when our dear soldiers bled on the battlefields defending our motherland? Where was the Troika when impovrished war veterans needed them the most? Vozhd Vatutin isn't like them however. He saw the horror of the Eastern European Front with his own eyes, and recently the military leader has announced an increase in soldier and veteran pensions, as recognition of their valiant efforts and resolve in the darkest hours of Russia. May God watch over them, and their efforts always remembered."
RUS_vilify_savinkov: "Vilify Savinkov"
RUS_vilify_savinkov_desc: "Once the Pale Horseman of Europe, Boris Savinkov has without a doubt changed the Russian society, perhaps to an irreversible degree. Now, however, if you go out of the propaganda-filled cities of Petrograd and Moscow, he is considered nothing more than a bloodthristy, sociopathic and senseless killer, being the one who promised the nation and its children a glorious future, only to send millions of Russians to their doom. Every portrait of the old man shall be removed from government buildings, as it is time for the citizens to forget. We have made a mistake, but we learned from it."
RUS_anti_nrpr: "Anti-SZRS Propaganda"
RUS_anti_nrpr_desc: "Nothing more than death in their own filth is what loyalists to the SZRS deserve. They launched our motherland into a war while unprepared, sent our boys to the frontlines only to die in the machine gun fire, and took advantage of their grieving and vulnerable parents.  Propaganda posters demonizing the party and its members shall be put up in every street, town, city and region of Russia, until the vermin is completely eliminated. Show them no mercy! "
RUS_hero_worship: "Hero Worship"
RUS_hero_worship_desc: "Strong, manly and brave. Those are the three words that could describe our Vozhd, Nikolai Vatutin. After the armistice that was signed with the Germans, the marshal stood by as the Troika assumed their role after the old man's \"untimely\" death. Not long after, however, the new triad quickly transformed into nothing but a sham government, doing as they pleased meanwhile the motherland was bleeding.\n\n Not being able to bear it any longer, Nikolai Vatutin, together with officers loyal to him and Russia, swept aside the rotten institution. Now, our Vozhd needs to restructure the very foundation of the political system that is a bitter reminder what path Russia went down. "
RUS_dissolve_nrpr: "Dissolve the SZRS"
RUS_dissolve_nrpr_desc: "The time has finally come. After the death of their \"beloved\" old man, the SZRS has transformed beyond recognition. Being eaten alive from within by petty interests and personal rivalries, it has been determined that the party shall get dissolved. As a result, the rats, having had their farce be uncovered, they already began splitting off from the Union of Defence and forming their insignificant parties that will get overshadowed within weeks. Our victory over the traitors from within has finally been reached! And in our triumph we will abolish them."
RUS_junta_supremacy: "Junta Supremacy"
RUS_junta_supremacy_desc: "The Defense Committee of the Revolutionary Army has solidified its position. Let us exploit this recent wave of popularity by increasing the intensity of the propaganda, in order to finally pacify Moskva. Perhaps, we could even abolish the SZRS, as their supporters watch in awe while their little fantasy world gets torn apart piece by piece."
RUS_rewrite_constitution: "Rewriting the Constitution"
RUS_rewrite_constitution_desc: "Constitutions are usually the documents who set the fundamental principles and institutions that the government is formed around. In Russia, however, it has been nothing but a tool for tyrants to further cement their rule. It is time for Vozhd Vatutin to decide which path he shall take: either set a new precedent and make a half-hearted attempt at reform by removing Savinkovist imagery and policies from the constitution, or maybe he could keep the tradition going by empowering himself even further. May God guide him towards the right path."

RUS_militarization: "Militarization"
RUS_militarization_desc: "If you ask any SZRS sympathizers about why our \"grand victory\" was nothing but a mutilated armistice, they will just talk on end about \"the traitors from within\" and how they ruined the chances of us succeeding. The harsh reality however, is that Russia was never prepared to enter the Second Weltkrieg, and Vozhd Vatutin has swallowed that pill long ago. In order for us to even have a chance to keep our holdings on a tight leash, the motherland must undergo a meticulous militarization process."
RUS_restructure_economy: "Restructure the Economy"
RUS_restructure_economy_desc: "A thing that is vital to the survival of the modern Russian State is a stable economy, something that the previous administrations had quite the trouble with. Be it the National-Socialist Five-Year-Plan of Leonid Brezhnev, or Vladimir Manstein's sad attempt to revive the internal market, one thing is certain. That Russia is in pain, and she needs our help."
RUS_disband_state_backed_unions: "Disband State Backed Unions"
RUS_disband_state_backed_unions_desc: "Nothing more than a legacy of the SZRS dictatorship, state controlled unions have long outlived their original purpose. In order to trick the naive minds of socialists, Savinkov allowed unions to be formed only under heavy government restrictions. After the recent changes however, they have done nothing but be a bureaucratic nightmare for Nikolai Vatutin. It is time to weed out the influence of syndicalism that has been rooted in the minds of our workers."
RUS_long_hours: "Longer Hours, Lower Pay"
RUS_long_hours_desc: "In order for the workers in the factories to keep up with the high demand for... well everything, we must tighten our belts and cut a few corners. Starting next week, the 12 hour work day will come into law, together with lower salaries for industrial labourers. This is something that many of our citizens feared. The discontent of workers seems to have grown over this issue, with many of them not being able to spend time with their children at home. "
RUS_eliminate_socialists: "Eliminate the Socialists"
RUS_eliminate_socialists_desc: "Barely above the vermin-like Germans, the syndicalist agitators have been nothing but a tumour to our motherland. Their endless strikes and sabotage attempts have been a reminder that, even though they claim to be the \"liberators of the proletariat\", they were mere agents of the communard French Government, in order to corrupt the young minds of our children. Cracking down on these radical groups seems to be the only logical response. We do not want another revolution now, do we?"
RUS_factory_bailouts: "Factory Bailouts"
RUS_factory_bailouts_desc: "Even though privatization seems to be the only way out of this economic limbo, factory bailouts could as well ease the burden that is placed on their workers. Pushed by the Vozhd himself, this plan has the objective to make Russia much more self-reliant on its own resources, while also expanding the civilian sector in the meantime. Truly, a plan only worthy of our Vozhd."
RUS_factory_expansion: "Factory Expansion Projects"
RUS_factory_expansion_desc: "Many small or isolated cities in Russia have been ignored or outright disregarded as the Great Patriotic War began to intensify. A major exodus from the barely industrialized parts of Russia took place, something which doomed many towns and villages. We need to aid these regions if we hope to kick-start the growth of our wavering economy. "
RUS_resource_expeditions: "Resource Expeditions"
RUS_resource_expeditions_desc: "Ah, Siberia. Land of gold, grain and death. Ever since the colonization process of the eastern part of Russia has been stopped, the development of the regions halted. That is until now however, as our researchers have recernly discovered riches besides the endless oil fields. Gold, zinc, diamonds and iron, all at our disposal. It would be foolish to not send out expeditions in Siberia to locate the coordinates of the countless minerals that reside there. Economy Minister Ustinov can already smell the rubles!"
RUS_privatization: "Privatization"
RUS_privatization_desc: "After Vozhd Vatutin came to power, the state owned industries collapsed under their own weight. The years of mismanagement and underfunding doomed the workers to a monotonous lifestyle. Economic minister Dmitri Ustinov has recently suggested that corporations and businesses that have outlived their use will be privatized and put up for sale, so as to our motivate the internal and external markets."
RUS_encourage_capitalists: "Encourage Capitalists"
RUS_encourage_capitalists_desc: "The lack of private bussinesses in Russia makes us seem like impoverished farmers who can't even sell their own products, thus dooming us to becoming the world's clown show. As such, the government shall give out loans to small and medium-sized bussinesses in order to, hopefully, stimulate the economy."
RUS_highest_bidder: "To the Highest Bidder"
RUS_highest_bidder_desc: "While many factories are closed and their workers left without a job, it is tempting to give in to corruption's sweet lies. We must set an example for the generations to come in order to guarantee the success of the Russian nation state. Putting the land the factory is located on up for sale is the safer option, while in the meantime it gives our population the impression that we are capable of fixing this chaos. Only one way to find out"
RUS_encourage_foreign_investment: "Encourage Foreign Investment"
RUS_encourage_foreign_investment_desc: "Since the beginning of the Great Patriotic war, Russia has been seen economically as an isolated giant, most of our economic partners cutting ties with us seemingly overnight. No one has been willing to trade with us out of fear of angering the Reichspakt and the Entente.\n\n We must try to attract as much foreign capital as possible from regional powers. Our neighbours from the Asian theatre might be a good choice of collaboration for a start. Who says that the motherland is opposed to \"Pan-Asianism\"? " 
RUS_government_favouritism: "Government Favouritism"
RUS_government_favouritism_desc: "The land of the Muscovites has always been plagued by corruption and nepotism. With boyars shaping the Russian society and its values for hundreds of years, it would be surprising if it didn't show any kind of problem. Who says that the KORA can't engage in a little double-dealing as well? After all, picking our favourites from the investor pool only seems fair after we saved the motherland from destruction."
RUS_sell_steel_industry: "Sell the Steel Industry"
RUS_sell_steel_industry_desc: "The metallurgical industry has been regarded as an outlier to compared to the other state owned production centers. What is to blame for their mediocre productivity is up in the air, as bureaucrats turn on and blame each other as soon as they get the chance. We must tighten our belts and set an example of them. Perhaps selling half of their assets will teach them a lesson or two. If nothing else, they will find themselves with some competition."
RUS_oil_profits: "Increase Oil Profits"
RUS_oil_profits_desc: "Diamonds that has always been under our noses, but never taken advantage of were practially endless fields of black gold, just east of the Ural mountains. This, together with the reclamation of the fuel-rich city of Baku could very well be blessing for us in our mission to repair our shattered economic stability. We must not let this opportunity go past us. Unemployed veterans of the Great Patriotic war will now have the opportunity to serve their motherland again, except this time from their oil wells instead of the stagnant frontline. "
RUS_military_oligarchs: "Military Oligarchs"
RUS_military_oligarchs_desc: "The Defense Committee of the Revolutionary Army was never an organization meant to directly lead the government. But with the recent political developments, it has had to become one. Already some leaders in the army have discovered they have a head not just for ordering men and managing logistics but also for business. By permitting these investments to be managed and allowing the army to dabble into the field of commerce, we can strengthen the role of KORA in the social fabric. Gathering their support is important if we wish to maintain our new quality standard."
RUS_increase_military_budget: "Deepen the Military Budget"
RUS_increase_military_budget_desc: "Keeping the military afloat during the war with the Germans was a tumultous task. Taking into account the massive shortages faced by the army during the offensives in Lithuania, and the countless factory strikes that followed, the military branch of the government became a bloated mess. After the removal of the Troika however, Vatutin, being a field marshal himself, sought to improve the situation.\n\nIn the present, the Russian army has been reformed into a force worthy of being considered the motherland's sword. If we want to compete with the Germans, however, further investment is needed to assure our generals that their demands are being met." 
RUS_open_for_business: "Open for Business"
RUS_open_for_business_desc: "After thorough economic and administrative challenges, Russia is ready to open up herself to the world. Whether by tourism, natural resources or military contracts, we are now able to trade with many ostracized countries from Asia and Africa, states who wish to purchase our services be they in experience or equipment. With the instability in Reichspakt and Accord colonialism, there are plenty of bidders."
RUS_military_industrial_complex: "Expand the Military-Industrial Complex"
RUS_military_industrial_complex_desc: "The military-industrial complex of Russia has only become stronger after Vozhd Vatutin's seizure of power. There is always room to grow, however. Hundreds of factories pump out military equipment on a daily basis, but many more lie with their gates closed and guards outside. Channeling more resources towards this will create more jobs for unemployed Russians, and secure the nation."
RUS_our_people_prosper: "Our People Shall Prosper!"
RUS_our_people_prosper_desc: "We have done it! The KORA, lead by Vozhd Nikolai Vatutin has undoubtedly saved the economy, as the malaise that has been plaguing it even before the Great Patriotic War is nowhere to be seen. Russia's future seems brighter with each passing day, as citizens can finally enjoy modern consumer goods after the arduous march through the downturn that has persisted in our motherland since the start of this century. Bozhe, khrani Vozhdya Vatutina!"

krg_rus.1.t: "The Sacred War Speech"
krg_rus.1.d: "The afternoon of April 2nd took many Russians by surprise. It was 8 PM, and those privileged enough to own a radio were huddled around the luxury device, listening to the daily programming on one of Russia's four stations. Suddenly, all programs were interrupted by a special news bulletin. After a brief introduction, the voice of the Vozhd was heard. Savinkov began to deliver a long, boring speech about the will of the Russian people, the goals of the Russian State, and the improving quality of life of those in the "liberated territories". This type of rhetoric was nothing new from the aging leader. However, as the speech began to come to a close, the Vozhd began to ramble.\n\nIt was obvious he was going off script. Perhaps this was his suffering mind taking over, or perhaps this boring speech was a ploy to get on the air without alarming his advisors. Savinkov's voice began to grow furious as he reminisced about the Great Patriotic War, those who had died, and the unrealized ambitions of the Russian State. For the first time in history, he referred to the war as a "failure" instead of an ongoing conflict. Many families across Russia breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the Vozhd declare that the Great Patriotic War was over.\n\nIce ran through their veins when he declared that "The Sacred War" had begun."
krg_rus.1.a: "Children… I think it's time for bed."

krg_rus.2.t: "Protests See Renewed Energy"
krg_rus.2.d: "In response to Savinkov's impassioned speech about his intentions to reignite war with Germany, hundreds of thousands flooded into the streets of Russia's largest cities. Numbers this large haven't been seen since the early days of the Anti-War movement back in 1948. These defeatists have gathered to protest in the largest cities of Russia, mainly Moscow, Petrograd, Novosibirsk, Denikinsk, and so on. To make matters worse, some low level officials and even soldiers have begun to march with the people, emboldening them further.\n\nLocal police have begun to crack down on these protests, hoping to contain them before things get out of hand."
krg_rus.2.a: "Traitors! All of them!"

krg_rus.3.t: "The Death of Savinkov"
krg_rus.3.d: "At 5 o'clock Moscow time, Vozhd Boris Savinkov was found dead in his quarters. An official autopsy declared that the Vozhd had died from complications of lung cancer. While his illness may have been an official state secret, it was no surprise to some that Vozhd Savinkov was suffering from cancer. He was a heavy smoker all throughout his life and towards the end of it, suffered from violent coughing fits and a sudden loss in weight. It's unknown if Savinkov ever sought treatment for his ailment, but now it's far too late. The Vozhd is dead."
krg_rus.3.a: "Long live the Vozhd!"

krg_rus.4.t: "Founding of the Troika"
krg_rus.4.d: "Mere hours after the death of Savinkov, Foreign Minister Georgiy Vernadsky received a call from his office. An emergency meeting of the Presidium had been ordered by Tysyatsky Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, to convene as soon as possible. Vernadsky had been expecting such a call, and wasted no time rushing to the Kremlin. Upon his arrival however, Vernadsky only found the Tysyatsky and Chief Propagandist Dmitri Shepilov. The two men informed Vernadsky that a number of plots were brewing right under their noses. Not only from defeatist civilians and treacherous officers, but opportunists in the SZRS. As a result, Shepilov and Shikhmatov offered Vernadsky a spot in their political alliance, establishing a troika.\n\nVernadsky gladly accepted. Following a round of handshakes, these men had become the most powerful figures in The Russian State."
krg_rus.4.a: "A triumvirate to rival Ceaser's!"

krg_rus.5.t: "Savinkov's Death Announced"
krg_rus.5.d: "We can't keep something so monumental as the death of our dear Vozhd a secret forever. At 9 AM today, the regularly scheduled broadcast on state radio was interrupted by the voice of Dmitri Shepilov. He regretted to inform the audience, and the people of Russia, that Vozhd Boris Savinkov died peacefully in his sleep from lung cancer. In addition to this, Tysyatsky Shirinsky-Shikhmatov had been declared the new Vozhd and sworn into office. Lastly, in accordance of Russian State law, all radio shows were canceled for the rest of the week to air memorial services and somber discussion on the legacy of Boris Savinkov."
krg_rus.5.a: "I miss him already!"

krg_rus.6.t: "Protests Spiral out of Control"
krg_rus.6.d: "After the declaration of the Vozhd's death, millions flooded into the street. But many are not there to mourn the loss of their beloved Vozhd, but to insult his legacy by engaging in further vile protest. With Savinkov gone, some assume that they are now free to sully his legacy and disrespect the Russian people. They are sorely mistaken. As the days go by, protests against the Russian State grow larger and larger, and become increasingly violent as police and protesters clash. The previously small protests have now grown immensely, and some of the more radical elements of the crowd have begun making demands. Demands for an end to the SZRS, and a return to the liberalism that once corrupted Russia. These calls are met with batons and bayonets, which in turn are met with bricks and chains. By the end of the week the majority of major protests have devolved into riots that tear through the city streets, hardly contained by our overstretched police forces.The situation is rapidly spiralling out of control.\n\nWhile some in the party have suggested calling in the Army, the Troika has regarded this suggestion as suspicious. The Army has been making a number of odd and shifty moves since the start of these protests, and it's no secret they're not the biggest fans of the Troika's rule. Inviting the Army out of their barracks may give them carte blanche to stage a military coup. On the other hand, the Army may not even wait for these orders if the situation cannot be dealt with in a timely manner."
krg_rus.6.a: "Act Quickly!"

krg_rus.24.t: "The Vozhd's New Year's Speech"
krg_rus.24.d: "The clock struck midnight.\n\nA barrage of fireworks cloud the skyline, families celebrate with their loved ones, a platoon of the local military band played an entire symphony of Russian military music. It is the greatest time to be alive in Russia. While the people may be under the clenched iron fist of Savinkov's sadistic mind, no one remembers that. Today is a day of solidarity, one that The Pale Horseman intends to capitalize.\n\nThis is the first time he has spoken in public since the Armistice was signed.\n\nSavinkov walked out into the balcony, with an array of microphones hooked towards megaphones and radio towers, and an army of his people gladfully cheering for him. Could be a staged audience - people paid or threatened to cheer lest they face something more gruesome - but nevertheless they cheer their hearts out. Savinkov smiles, somewhat eerily to the point of a madman, but at this moment, he can only think of one thing - how far has he come. Yesterday, he was merely a writer who yearned for revolution. Today, he is now the face of Russia, he is now the living embodiment - the heart and soul - of Russia. The true Vozhd.\n\nHe started his speech soft and mild-mannered, reading his prepared speech that his army of propagandists have prepared for him. He started speaking of the solidarity of the Russian people, how they were able to triumph over all hardships with sheer will and tenacity. He spoke that this day is for unity, that despite differences, we are all Russians by blood. However, moments later, he started tearing apart the speech piece by piece, and a rush of rage started flowing in his veins. He became ecstatic and filled with anger, raging about a knife in the back, a betrayal of all Russians by defeatists who he assured the audience, would be punished. He continued his rant until he experienced a severe cough, upon which they had no choice but to cut the speech short."
krg_rus.24.a: "Surely that was a metaphor… right?"

krg_rus.25.t: "Rebuild the Nation"
krg_rus.25.d: "Everyday the people of the Russian State thank God, for the Great Patriotic War did not come to Russia proper. However, it did come to the lands the Russian State has now liberated, the Ukraine and Belorussia especially. The southern bank of the Dnieper is devastated, the once proud city of Minsk stands in ruin, and Sevastopol has almost been blasted off the map, owing its devastation to brutal siege and counter-siege.\n\nThese lands are true Russian land, and we must work for them to be made habitable again. Infrastructure and industry must be rebuilt, fields must be replanted, and the peoples of these lands remember that they are part of the proud Russian people. Though we can only focus on one region at once, in time all of our liberated lands will flourish and our Vozhd will usher in a new Russian Golden Age!"
krg_rus.25.a: "Liberation at last!"

krg_rus.26.t: "Project Varangian"
krg_rus.26.d: "The day 'Heimdallr' devastated the British city of Portsmouth was a day that shook the world. Warfare was changed forever and in a fraction of a second, every weapon of the Russian State became obsolete. The ultimate weapon of mass destruction had been developed, and it was possessed by Russia's greatest enemy.\n\nSince that fateful day, Savinkov and his closest advisors had been hard at work, meeting with military designers, air force commanders, and nuclear experts. After weeks of deliberation and planning, Project Varangian has been announced. The SZRS has established "Laboratory No. 2" in Moscow, consisting of the nation's top nuclear scientists and experts. The express purpose of this top secret project is simple:\n\nProduce a nuclear weapon able to rival the Kaiser's!"
krg_rus.26.a: "Bringing together the best and brightest of Russia."

krg_rus.27.t: "Lessons from the Great Patriotic War"
krg_rus.27.d: "Mistakes were made.\n\nNobody would dare say this in front of the Vozhd, but behind closed doors, in meetings of military brass, this phrase is often repeated. The losses suffered during the Siege of Odessa and the disaster at Courland revealed the shortcomings of the Russian military. The Revolutionary Army failed to react to sudden changes in military situations and how fluid the frontlines could be, being challenged by the Hun despite their numerical superiority. In addition to this, many young lives were lost in disastrous assaults, launched without the proper support needed to secure it's success.\n\nMany things are going to need to change if the Revolutionary Army of the Russian State is going to both recover and thrive following the cost of the Great Patriotic War. Thankfully, our officer corps are vast and thriving with new talent with new ideas and new points-of-view, and any one of them could prove to be a military mastermind."
krg_rus.27.a: "Pass me that combat report lieutenant."

krg_rus.28.t: "Policy of Liberated Land"
krg_rus.28.d: "Thousands of square kilometers of Russian land has been liberated from the Hun, but we cannot rest easy just yet. These regions have been devastated by seven long years of war, and as a result are heavily scarred. Homes need to be rebuilt, roads need to be repaved, and citizens need to be resettled.\n\nThis is a huge propaganda opportunity for the Russian State. If the newly liberated territories can provide a better life for its inhabitants than they once had under German puppet rule, then many will eagerly flock back to their homes. However, this is a long and arduous process, and with only a fragile ceasefire preventing yet another German assault, we may have to act quickly and make fewer concessions."
krg_rus.28.a: "Did the Ukrainians drive on the left or the right…?"

krg_rus.29.t: "Languages in Ukraine"
krg_rus.29.d: "Language in newly liberated Ukraine has fast become one of the largest issues facing the Russian State in the region. While many of the citizens of major cities east of the Dnieper river already speak Russian, a great number of those living in the countryside only speak Ukrainian. The debate on how to rectify this is a hot button issue in Moscow. Moderates in the SZRS call for Ukrainian to be recognized and protected as a minority language, while hardliners call for the language to be banned. At the end of the debate, a stopgap measure was adopted. For the time being, "surzhyk", the amalgamation of both Russian and Ukrainian, will be encouraged as a way to promote bilingualism."
krg_rus.29.a: "How do you ask for a drink in Ukrainian again?"

krg_rus.30.t: "Our Loyal Minorities"
krg_rus.30.d: "Loyal minority" is a new term in Russia. First coined by Boris Savinkov in the very first point of his "Demands of the Russian People.\n\n`The Russian People demand the unification of all Russians and the loyal minorities that have heretofore constituted part of her natural territories under a Russian State, one and indivisible.`\n\nHowever, "loyal minority" is a vague term, which leaves many politicians in the SZRS to interpret it as they please. Are Ukrainians and Belorussians minorities? If so does that mean the Komi and the Yakuts, who have lived in Russia for centuries, are minorities too? What about the Cossacks of Southern Russia? For now, the Russian State has released a blanket statement that the "loyal minorities" of Russia will be protected. Whoever wishes to interpret themselves as a loyal minority can do so, for now."
krg_rus.30.a: "Should we ask the Vozhd to elaborate?"

krg_rus.31.t: "Closed City Experiments"
krg_rus.31.d: "The idea of a "closed city" is something that, at least on paper, seems distinctly Russian. A city so important to national defense that it is quite literally closed off to the world, surrounded by fences and heavy weapons. In addition to the defenses, these closed cities are not located on any maps and have had their original names erased, now bearing the name of the closest major city. People from outside the city may not visit, and those living within may not leave. The reasoning for this is simple. If the Germans do not know that these vital cities exist, they will not be touched in the event of a nuclear war.\n\nMany of these cities house our nuclear research and testing facilities, making secrecy and defense highly important. If infiltrated or destroyed, the nuclear efforts of the Russian State could be sent back months, years, or even decades. For this reason, nuclear research is done in secrecy, and with the utmost caution.\n\nThe world must not know of Russia's nuclear ambitions. Not yet."
krg_rus.31.a: "Zheleznogorsk? Never heard of it."

krg_rus.32.t: "The Russian State in 1948"
krg_rus.32.d: "Eight million men. Eight million men was the cost of what? Half of what the Russian people set out to achieve? We entered this war a proud nation with a strong leader and an unbroken spirit. And how did we leave it? An exhausted heap with a wrecked economy and a madman in charge.\n\nFirst, our advisors warned us. Every last one. Warned us that we weren't ready for war. On paper we had three million men ready to march to Berlin. Yet, we lacked the tools to get us there. Where we should have had trucks, we had pack animals. Where we should have had tanks, we had armored cars. Where we should have had a modern fighting force, we had an army that was essentially in limbo only five years ago. And now our villages, factories, and streets lack men. They now find themselves in the military, the labor army, or a grave.\n\nBut not only did the Great Patriotic War cost young men, but our reserves as well. It's not a surprise that Savinkov's sudden militarization harmed our economy, but adding the war atop that opened the floodgates of economic problems. High inflation and debt coupled poorly with crumbling institutions and damaged infrastructure.\n\nAnd last...something changed in Savinkov, our Vozhd, when the Great Patriotic War began. He reveled in the destruction. Nothing made him giddier than hearing of how many young men died in an attack on the vile Hun. In his private writings, Savinkov referred to himself as many things; "Vozhd," "Terrorist," "The Pale Horsemen." It may have been his mind slipping with age, or perhaps Savinkov was always like this, a thrill seeker first, a born-leader second. But between his destructive orders, dangerous offensives, and general incompetence by his inner circle, some blame the Vozhd for the stalemate on the front. But perhaps the order to advance once again won't be given by the Vozhd, but through him. A never ending stream of bureaucrats and party members now vie for Savinkov's favor, and who knows what may happen if they gain control over him.\n\nFor now, the Russian State is at a precipice. Liberated lands lie in ruins, filled with partisans who attack our soldiers at every turn. Poverty and hunger has become a way of life for the village folk of our nation. And all of this while the population fear the resumption of the Great Patriotic War as the clock ticks away at the Armistice."
krg_rus.32.a: "Russia is bleeding, and if nothing changes soon, it will die."

krg_rus.33.t: "The Vozhd"
krg_rus.33.d: "From afar, Boris Viktorovich Savinkov is a terrifying figure. To those who have never met him, he is a gigantic man with an iron will, endless wisdom, and a cold heart of stone. A man who is never afraid to do what was best for his people, even if it means leaving a long trail of blood. He is the light that guided Russia through the chaos of 1937, the spearhead of Russia's economic reversal, and the only leader willing to defy the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. He is the father of the nation, the Pale Horseman, the Vozhd.\n\nBut to those who know the man personally, Boris Viktorovich Savinkov is anything but what the people believe him to be. Approaching 70, Savinkov is a frail old man. He struggles to take a seat at meetings, his clothes loosely cling to his thin body, and every so often he violently coughs blood into a handkerchief. A lifetime of heavy smoking and drinking, mixed with little sleep or rest, have left the Vozhd frail. \n\nHe is not long for this world. Boris Savinkov has lost his iron will, now increasingly susceptible to manipulations from his advisors. He has lost his endless wisdom, now often mumbling political nonsense at Presidium meetings. And he has lost his heart of stone, now often spending his hours reminiscing over lost time, failed ambitions, and long gone friends.\n\nBut he is still Vozhd, and as long as he breathes, the Vozhd is eternal."
krg_rus.33.a: "God Save the Vozhd!"

krg_rus.34.t: "The Tysyatsky"
krg_rus.34.d: "In the entirety of Russia, no man was more visible to the public than the Vozhd. But by his side, or perhaps in his shadow, always stands his number two. Yuri Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, the Tysyatsky, the Deputy Vozhd, the next in line as Vozhd, was the second most important man in all of Russia. Strong and handsome in his youth, Yuri was a veteran of both the First Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War. However, if one were to dig through public archives about the Tysyatsky's life prior to the war, they would struggle to find much of anything. The second most important man in the party of the Russian peasantry was once a prince, a landed squire, a member of the Russian nobility. If word got out to the rural folk that their Vozhd's closest confidant was a member of the class that once ruled over them, only God could tell what their reaction would be. But that was the past. Shikhmatov had renounced his titles and lands decades ago, when he first joined the SZRS.\n\nNowadays, the Tysyatsky plays his role as the greatest public supporter of the Vozhd. Preliminary to every major speech given by the Vozhd, Shikhmatov is almost always there to give his own speech. To some, the Tysyatsky's only role is to be the Vozhd's greatest brown-noser. But if one were to be a fly on the wall of Savinkov and Shikhmatov's private discussions, they might be shocked by the sheer amount of shouting and insults thrown to-and-fro. Publicly the two agreed on everything, privately they agreed on almost nothing. Yuri Shirinsky-Shikhmatov had his own plans for the future of Russia.\n\nTo him Russia was sacred, Russia was holy, and Russia was pure. Or it should be. To the Tysyatsky, Russia was still as sick as it was in the July Days of 1917. The armistice with Germany only strengthened this belief. To Shikhmatov, defeatists and traitors pervaded Russia, weakening her from within. For now, the Tysyatsky bides his time, gathering his allies, as he awaits the day he becomes Vozhd. For while Vozhd Savinkov may be mighty, he is not immortal. That day will come, and God help those who oppose him."
krg_rus.34.a: "This isn't what the Vozhd wanted!"

krg_rus.35.t: "The General Secretary"
krg_rus.35.d: "On the surface, being the "Secretary" of the SZRS sounds like quite the tedious job. However, this could not be further from the truth. There are many benefits to running the SZRS's Secretariat, the organ that handles the party's day-to-day functions. While the Vozhd may be the face of Russia with the Tysyatsky as his Deputy, the General Secretary runs the party. For this reason, some suspect that whoever holds that office is the one really in control.\n\nAnd that man is Dmitri Shepilov. A law graduate of Moscow State University, Shepilov worked as a prosecutor in the Russian Republic. A first hand witness to the corruption of Kerensky's government, Shepilov began to despise the old order. In 1931, Shepilov began to take his first dive into politics. Running on an anti-corruption campaign, he won an election to become Mayor of Smolensk. During Savinkov's rise to power, Shepilov quickly studied up on the former's manifesto and doctrines, becoming something of an expert on "National Renewal." After a successful career as a Commissar in the Military, the now Major General was invited into Savinkov's inner circle.\n\nMajor General Shepilov is now General Secretary Shepilov, an incredibly conservative loyalist to the Vozhd and the party. Shepilov has built his career around preparing for the future of Russia, of course without reference to the inevitable demise of the founding Vozhd. Instead Shepilov's doctrine has been focused on solidifying the institutions Savinkov has established, hoping to prevent any deterioration of the Vozhd's ideology; or worse, revisionism."

krg_rus.36.t: "The Foreign Minister"
krg_rus.36.d: "If one was to look into Georgiy Vernadsky's past, they might be a little confused as to why exactly he was in the position he found himself in. The son of a famed geologist, Vernadsky comes from a long line of Russian intellectuals. A member of the Kadet party in the Duma, Vernadsky became increasingly frustrated with the government's inability to combat Russia's numerous societal ills. 1935 became an important year for Duma Member Vernadsky, as he finally sat down with a fellow writer and colleague. That man was Boris Savinkov, leader of the SZRS.\n\nVernadsky was one of the few Kadet members to cross the aisle and join Savinkov's party, enticed by Savinkov's grandiose promises that he would create a grand Russia, for all her peoples. Perhaps a pragmatist, or perhaps blinded by rhetoric, Vernadsky put his full support in Savinkov. Loyalty has its rewards, and now, thirteen years later, Georgiy Vernadsky finds himself at the head of Russia's foreign ministry.\n\nHowever, a man forced to smile and shake hands with every enemy of the Russian State becomes quite good at hiding his deception. Georgiy Vernadsky, displeased with the Vozhd's actions over the past decade, is plotting. The Vozhd has promised a great many things, and in the eyes of Vernadsky, delivered on very few. Like every other politician in Moscow, Vernadsky has his allies, and keeps them close. When he plans his move however, is yet to be known."

krg_rus.37.t: "The Marshal"
krg_rus.37.d: "If one had to ask who the second most recognizable man in all of Russia was behind the Vozhd, they wouldn't struggle to find an answer. Marshal of the Revolutionary Army, Nikolai Vatutin was that recognizable face. His round and fairly chubby figure was often seen in propaganda pictures as the war progressed and the relatively young commander rose through the ranks. While at first serving under other generals, Vatutin's successes on the northern front during the Great Patriotic War led to his swift promotion to Marshal of the Revolutionary Army. Now the Marshal is a household name, with children often asking their parents if any news about "Marshal Vatutin" appeared in the paper, wives fretting over the always busy Marshal's children, and young officers often arguing about his tactics over a game of cards.\n\nVozhd Boris Savinkov had gotten rid of men as popular as Vatutin before. They were often threats to his power after all. Yet, no Vozhd-ordered ill ever befell the Marshal. Perhaps Savinkov was getting soft with age, maybe the young Marshal and the Vozhd agreed on things, or perhaps Boris saw something in Nikolai that reminded him of himself. No matter. What was important was that Marshal Nikolai Vatutin was skilled, charismatic, and loved by the people. Under hushed tones, some even said they would like to see Marshal Vatutin as Vozhd one day."

krg_rus.38.t: "The Commissar and the Natsgvardia"
krg_rus.38.d: "Pavel Gorgulov is not a stable man. He is quick to anger, resorts to violence often, and is almost worryingly fanatical. Perhaps that is the reason why he was chosen to lead the Natsgvardia, or National Guard. The successors of Savinkov's Combat Squads, the Natsgvardia is the military arm of the SZRS. While Gorgulov may be the first to jump at an occasion to speak the praises of the party, his rhetoric often strays wildly from the Vozhd's own ideology. The energetic Commissar often speaks of Russia as a land of \"Barbarians, Peasants, and Scythians\", who must \"throw off the shackles of civilization with extreme violence!\"\n\nIn fact, violence is brought up often in his speeches, and appears to be instilled in the minds of every member of the Natsgvardia. The organization's record during the Great Patriotic War was notable to say the least. When assigned to a combat mission, the Natsgvardia met the enemy head on with incredible fanaticism. However, their combat record was tattered by their behavior off the battlefield. The Natsgvardia treated prisoners of war horrifically, often abused civilian populaces, and were known to shoot suspected deserters on the spot, without trial.\n\nPavel Gorgulov has raised an army of fanatic thugs, loyal to only three things: Him, The Vozhd, and Russia. But at the end of the day, perhaps this is what Savinkov wants. A group of a million unhinged lunatics at his beck and call. A nuclear option in case anyone decided his time as Vozhd had come to an end."

krg_rus.39.d: "Despite all the lands we have liberated, despite all the blood the Russian people have spilled, despite all of our accomplishments, there are some who are never satisfied. What started out as workers strikes against the continuation of wartime hours has recently begun to spiral out of control. Aimless wanderers, disobedient students, and even mutinous soldiers have begun to take to the streets to protest our continuing state of war against the German Empire. They do not seem to understand that this is only a temporary respite against the Hun, that we need them to rebuild our strength in preparation for the day war comes to Russia again.\n\nBroadcasts about how they are weakening the nation and giving into German propaganda did not seem to sway them. Recent police crackdowns have ended in violent skirmishes with protestors but no loss of life has been reported yet. These protests are certainly loud and obnoxious, but they aren't threatening. Again, not yet."

krg_rus.40.d: "Ever since the Vozhd's Sacred War Speech, things have only continued to spiral out of control. Savinkov's closest advisors in the Presidium have implored him to attend an emergency session, but he refuses. Citing illness, Savinkov refuses to leave his personal dacha on the outskirts of Moscow. Those who have seen the Vozhd have noted that he seems increasingly sickly and irritable, with some fearing he may go into full isolation in the wake of the people's response to his call for war.\n\nMeanwhile in the streets, the situation only continues to worsen. Multiple protestors are dead, and a number of police have been grievously wounded. The mayors of Petrograd and Smolensk have requested help from the military, but without a meeting between the Presidium and the head of the local garrisons, the order cannot be given. If something is not done soon, this entire situation could lead to a full blown revolution."

krg_rus.41.t: "Army Coup In Moscow"
krg_rus.41.d: "After months of the SZRS's inability to quell the ever increasing violence and size of the protests, the Revolutionary Army has stepped in to put the floundering government out of their misery. At 0800 hours, trucks packed with soldiers moved into the capital and a number of major cities across Russia. In what looked like a highly coordinated effort, the military quickly cordoned off key buildings and captured their respective staff. A number of SZRS officials were publicly arrested, often to cheers from the crowds of protestors on the streets. These officials included the members of the hated troika, Shikhmatov, Shepilov, and Vernadsky. By 1800 that night, the radios crackled to life with the voice of popular war hero Nikolai Vatutin. The Marshal stated that in light of the protestor's demands against the SZRS, the Revolutionary Army acted in the people's interest. As of that moment, the government was under the control of the Komitet Oborony Revolutsionnoy Armii, or Defense Committee of the Revolutionary Army.\n\nSatisfied with the arrest of the Troika and the imminent collapse of the SZRS, many protestors went home satisfied. Those few who remained in defiance of the military government continued their protests, foolishly believing they were fighting for something greater than a regime change. These poor souls were quickly crushed by the army, with few left to speak of whatever ideals they were fighting for. The military certainly didn't ask."

Savinkov would have shot you for daring to say that in this very room if he still drew breath."\n\nVernadsky listened to the drunk Shikhmatov bellow at him before responding as patiently and calmly as he could. "I am as loyal to our Vozhd as any one of you. Loyalty to the cause in the face of every setback is noble. Loyalty to a strategy is madness. We simply have no other choice than a proper armistice with the Kaiserreich. Now if you'd just-"\n\n"Impossible." Shepilov stated flatly. "The damned  Teutons have taken too many of our sons for such a thing to ever stand. We'd be lynched in the streets by angry mobs, and we'd deserve it." In one sense, Vernadsky was pleased with how the conversation was going. This was probably the most honest he'd ever been with anyone in this government in years. "How many many more widows and orphans must we make before we realize that-"\n\n"As many German ones as it takes!" Shikhmatov said as he slammed a fist onto the table. "I say we send our boys back over the Dnpeir before the year is done. Up the quotas of the factories. Bash the skulls of the enemies of the people who even think the word "strike". There are enough fresh faced lads around to fill the ranks of the revolutionary army if we have the will to use them."\n\n"You're rambling like a drunken half-witted Bavarian peasant." Shepilov rebuked Shikhmatov, "Both of you are dishonoring Savinkov's memory with your degenerate conduct."\n\nAnd on it went for hours, until the Presidium agreed to adjourn, more from exhaustion than from anything else."

krg_rus.45.t: "Vernadsky's New Book"
krg_rus.45.d: "The first copies of, "Russia and The Theory and Practice of the New Nationalism" were placed on bookshelves in Moskau today, and will be available all across the country in a matter of days. While written by prominent member of the SZRS's Presidium, Vernadsky, it appears to have caught many of his fellow comrades in the party by surprise. While frequently praising the wisdom and strength of will displayed by the late Savinkov, the book is a departure from the common cultural policy of the SZRS.\n\nIn the new work, Vernadsky contrasts the Russian nationalist movement with those that once engulfed Germany, France, and Italy. While praising the nationalist impulses that drove the revolutions in those countries, he both critiqued their accompanying liberalism and the excessive uniformity those nationalisms espoused, such as the artificial standardization of languages. "Our Nationalism, or in truth any enlightened nationalism, is not threatened by such petty differences. Loyalty to the state is what we require, and the unique cultural practices of every Russian man and woman do not diminish our nation. Indeed, to remove these differences would be to destroy the soul of Russianness itself." The book also seems to offer gentle praise for the model currently adopted by the Danubian Federation, while also sharply critiquing some of it's alleged deficiencies and willingness to side with "the vulgar nationalism of the German Reich". The category of "Loyal Minority", while occasionally mentioned, plays little to no role in the theories layed out in Vernadsky's work.\n\nPerhaps most scandalous of all is the closing to the book, where it closes with the phrase, "Glory to Russia and all her Peoples". This has quickly become the focus of criticism by other more orthodox members of the SZRS, accusing him of the ultimate political heresy by suggesting that the Russian people may be divided and categorized as distinct "peoples" and not as one "people".

Did they deal fairly with us when they robbed us of our homeland? We do not have the choice of if we should break the ceasefire, we have the duty to annihilate it."\n\nThe impassioned speech went on for nearly half an hour, where the enthusiastic party member went on at length about his plan to bring the entire Russian economy onto a war footing again, to purge rot and incompetence in the Russian Revolutionary Army. He also pushed for the immediate and unequivocal annexation of both Transcaucasia and Russian Central Asia, decrying their autonomy as a "blasphemy against Russian unity". Most alarmingly of all, he went onto say how no Russian could rest in peace until Both Vienna and Berlin had been razed to the ground.\n\n"For there is only room in Europe for one great power. That power must be the Slavic power, the Russian power. Should we fail in this endeavor, our descendants will rightfully damn us for subjecting them to inevitable Germanic slavery."Placeholder"

Finally, motion twelve for the day, "The formal confirmation of Tysyatsky Georgiy Shirinsky-Shikhmatov as Vozhd of the Russian State." Everything was calm in the Kremlin's Senate, the official seat of the Party Congress. Some minor murmuring and looks from left to right moments before the motion went to voting. A two-thirds majority was needed for this confirmation, but Shikhmatov's ascension was all but assured, he was the Deputy to the Vozhd after all. The motion finally went to voting and...\n\nIt failed, with less than a third of the Congress voting to approve Shikhmatov's promotion. Almost on cue, the supporters of General Secretary Shepilov began to pound their desk and stomp their feet. The, at first visibly confused, supporters of Vernadsky soon joined in, the noise an official protest against the Tysyatsky. It would be only moments before General Secretary Shepilov took the stage and made his move. A new motion. The immediate ejection of Tysyatsky Shikhmatov and Foreign Minister Vernadsky from the party. The General Secretary read off a list of alleged grievances and offenses weighed against his associates, but shouts and stomping feet drowned him out. The motion never went to vote, as supporters of Shikhmatov and Vernadsky stormed out of the Kremlin.\n\nHowever, things didn't go as planned for the General Secretary either, as some of the allies he thought he had secured in the weeks prior, walked out with the other two factions.

Death!'\n\nShepilov glanced to Vernadsky while Shikmatov nodded to Brezhnev, as Savinkov suddenly slumped back into his seat, apparently done as quickly as he had become live.\n\nBrezhnev pinched the bridge of his nose and resumed his report..." 
krg_rus_rwk.7.a: "We're seeing a shortfall in tractor production."

krg_rus_rwk.8.t: "The Administrator's Trial"
krg_rus_rwk.8.d: "The overburdened judicial system can only process the defeatists so fast, but the paralysing influence of their work in the sabotaging of the war economy cannot be overstated. Many confessions are taken and then judges are proclaiming sentence without even seeing the defendant, in order to streamline the process. Examples of confessions include 'Defeatism is so insidious. It just creeps up on you. My daughter found it out. Very proud of her. Very grateful I've been discovered before it's too late. They won't shoot me, will they, Ivanov? I know I could be very useful in a labor camp.'\n\n'I accuse myself of the following crimes...Together with other agents,  I have counterfeited banknotes... wrecked industrial machinery,  polluted the water supply... guided German rocket bombs to targets within Russia... by means of coded radio signals. I stand here, a victim of the influence of Rodion Malinovsky. Guilty on all counts. I'm glad I was caught. I was mentally deranged. Now I am cured.\n I ask only for you to accept my love of our leader. I ask only to be shot while my mind is still clean.' " 
krg_rus_rwk.8.a: "Removing the Cancer."

krg_rus_rwk.9.t: "A Flame"
krg_rus_rwk.9.d: "Gorgulov passed the document to Savinkov and then glanced around the room before handing out some duplicated copies for the others to read. Shepilov slowly read the text and then glanced up to Gorgulov. Savinkov had already scrawled his signature on his copy and then Gorgulov leant over and placed his in a second spot.\n\nThe Document read, as Shepilov looked again, \nDecree for the formation of Special Tribunals to Counter Defeatist Movement in the Cities and Countryside\n\nAny three members of the SZRS may, upon finding a defeatist proceed to try the individual immediately, and follow up with the judicial sentence for defeatism - death.\n\nShikhmatov looked up and down, and then walked to stand by Savinkov, signing the third place on the document. He looked Gorgulov dead in the eye, then nodded as the other man folded the paper into neat thirds." 
krg_rus_rwk.9.a: "So it's done then."

krg_rus_rwk.10.t: "A Secret Communique"
krg_rus_rwk.10.d: "Perhaps one of the riskiest moves made in their careers, and the first solid evidence of disloyalty to Savinkov by the Troika left the Kremlin in the satchel of a trusted courier. The three men dispatched a secret communique seeking peace to the German embassy after darkness had fallen in Moscow.\n\nAnd then they waited."
krg_rus_rwk.10.a: "Off into the night."

krg_rus_rwk.11.t: "A Russian Communique"
krg_rus_rwk.11.d: "An intriguing communique from the upper echelons of the Russian government, it appears a significant faction has formed to seek peace. This could be an opportunity to demilitarise the Eastern borders somewhat. We should open with our demands and see where this leads."
krg_rus_rwk.11.a: "Our previous borders must be restored."

krg_rus_rwk.12.t: "The Price of Peace"
krg_rus_rwk.12.d: "Vernadsky managed to find a moment to pull aside Shepilov and Shikmatov. His voice was low as his eyes darted between the pair. \"Germany wants the 1936 borders in the treaty.\". He looked between them for a moment, waiting for one of them to speak. Eventually Shikhmatov seemed to form a sentence."
krg_rus_rwk.12.a: "A bitter pill to swallow. But we must."
krg_rus_rwk.12.b: "8 million dead for nothing? They're mad."

krg_rus_rwk.13.t: "An extension?"
krg_rus_rwk.13.d: "Our best intelligence agents have reported that Savinkov is sick and that he is busily pursuing 'defeatists' within the country. He'll never sign a treaty - indeed if he were not co-opted by this group of men, we could be certain he'd seek to violate the fragile peace in the east. This 'Troika' we're negotiating with assure us however that they will sign the treaty as soon as he is out of the way.\n\nGiven the Entente threat on our flank, the political situation with regards to the ending of the Enabling Act and the fact that we are finally at peace...\nIt seems that the Russians look set to tear themselves apart for some time yet..."
krg_rus_rwk.13.a: "We will extend the armistice for the time being."

krg_rus_rwk.14.t: "Russian blustering"
krg_rus_rwk.14.d: "The Russians say they can't possibly have suffered such a loss and not even retain some of their gains. Perhaps we should be willing to compromise on our position? The clock is running down and we face war if we do not come to some agreement...\n\nThe minimalist camp states we should request the Ukraine, with further negotiation at the treaty table.\nThe maximalists think we should remind the Russians who has harnessed the power of the atom."
krg_rus_rwk.14.a: "The Ukraine, for starters..."
krg_rus_rwk.14.b: "Our words are backed by Nuclear Weapons..."

krg_rus_rwk.15.t: "The Ukraine"
krg_rus_rwk.15.d: "Vernadsky once again managed to arrange a brief conversation in the halls of the Kremlin with Shepilov and Shikmatov. The latest news of the trials had him edgy and as he looked between the two he took a greedy pull on a cigarette before exhaling and speaking. \"I have been sending letters back and forth for awhile now. The Germans have compromised on many points, either pushing them down the timeline, or stepping back, but this is their one red line. The Ukraine will be returned, in it's entirety to the Ukrainian State. We can't get them to budge on it. And frankly it would mean we still keep Belarussia and our Finnish land.\"\n\nHe looked between the pair of them for a moment and then nervously flicked ash into a small ceramic ashtray that was resting on the windowsill. \"I would normally never countenance this point, but we are running out of time... and someone is going to notice all these damn couriers!\" Shepilov reached out and lightly patted Vernadsky on the shoulder, then glancing around, he opened his mouth to speak."
krg_rus_rwk.15.a: "We will return one day, but not this day."

krg_rus_rwk.16.t: "Nineteen Thirty Six"
krg_rus_rwk.16.d: "Vernadsky once again managed to arrange a brief conversation in the halls of the Kremlin with Shepilov and Shikmatov. The latest news of the trials had him edgy and as he looked between the two he took a greedy pull on a cigarette before exhaling and speaking. \"I have been sending letters back and forth for awhile now.The Germans have retorted their demands are simple enough that even a child could understand them, and that they are not afraid to use nuclear weapons in order to ensure they're fulfilled.\"\n\nHe looked between the pair of them for a moment and then nervously flicked ash into a small ceramic ashtray that was resting on the windowsill. \"We have lost eight million men to war with them, but this is too much. We cannot sign a treaty that would undermine the entirety of our work, of the Vozhd's work...\"\n\n\"I will reply that we are here to make peace, not threaten and posture, and hope cooler heads prevail.\"Shepilov reached out and lightly patted Vernadsky on the shoulder, then glancing around, he opened his mouth to speak."
krg_rus_rwk.16.a: "They are unhinged to suggest as much."

krg_rus_rwk.17.t: "A Deal in Principle"
krg_rus_rwk.17.d: "Vernadsky's mood was much improved when he managed to pull Shepilov and Shikmatov aside to speak with them next. He was almost excited as he leaned in and spoke lowly. \"We have a deal. Now we just need to provide the assurances that we will honor it, and that the Vozhd will not interfere...\". The other two men both smiled and nodded."
krg_rus_rwk.17.a: "Let us hope they're willing to play along."

krg_rus_rwk.18.t: "Timewasting and baseless threats"
krg_rus_rwk.18.d: "The Russians have some nerve. They've looked our nuclear threat right in the eye and they didn't blink.\n\nThey've reiterated a desire for peace, and would be willing to make some concessions, however they have no time for baseless threats and posturing. The Foreign Ministry believe we've overplayed our hand and we should just demand the Ukraine, at least for now."
krg_rus_rwk.18.a: "The Ukraine will have to do."
krg_rus_rwk.18.b: "§RBaseless threats!?§!"

krg_rus_rwk.19.t: "The question of Pavel Timofeyovich"
krg_rus_rwk.19.d: "Pavel Timofeyovich Gorgulov's star has been rising lately, with this latest set of purges. He is not yet aware of our plan to extend the armistice, and the question is what do we do about that... It cannot be left to chance, since he is Savinkov's hand for crushing the 'defeatists' and he would turn the Natsgvardia on all of us if he found out independently."
krg_rus_rwk.19.a: "We must resolve this alone."
krg_rus_rwk.19.b: "Let's include the army..."
krg_rus_rwk.19.c: "He can be made to see reason, surely."

krg_rus_rwk.20.t: "The Special Tribunal"
krg_rus_rwk.20.d: "Ironically Savinkov has given us the very tool we need to justify getting rid of Gorgulov. Where better for the arch-defeatist to hide than in the Natgvardia, deflecting his failures onto those around him, persecuting innocents to hide his shame. We will form a special Troika and try Gorgulov once he attends a special session relating to Natsgvardia preparedness for the resumption of hostilities. We have got all the men in the room and they can be trusted..."
krg_rus_rwk.20.a: "Now we wait for him to arrive."

krg_rus_rwk.21.t: "Calling in the Army"
krg_rus_rwk.21.d: "In most countries the Army is not involved in politics. Ideally, that includes Russia. However, these times call for desperate measures... and we believe the Army are more interested in the continued survival of the nation than a resumption of hostilities.\n\nThe question is, do we want to set the precedent that they can be called upon to interfere in Party matters?"
krg_rus_rwk.21.a: "Precedent be damned, get Vatutin."
krg_rus_rwk.21.b: "Actually on second thought..."
krg_rus_rwk.21.c: "We should just talk to Gorgulov!"

krg_rus_rwk.22.t: "Talking with Gorgulov"
krg_rus_rwk.22.d: "The Troika walked into his office, their hands in their pockets as they smiled crisply and greeted Gorgulov. They asked if they could talk with him in private, and the guardsmen left the room promptly. Then they started to talk, a few probing, indirect questions that ultimately led to them outlining the whole situation as Gorgulov looked between them, his expression carefully neutral throughout.\n\nAfter they finished he paused, raised his brows and then folded his hands together before he spoke. 'I'll have to think it over...' "
krg_rus_rwk.22.a: "They got to their feet and left without obstruction..."

krg_rus_rwk.23.t: "The Emergency Trial of Pavel Timofeyovich Gorgulov"
krg_rus_rwk.23.d: "As he stepped through the door to the Presidium, Pavel Timofeyovich wished for a moment that he had not handed in his gun to the guard on the door. The Natsgvardia were supposed to trust in him, and the Vozhd alone. But the Vozhd wasn't there, despite the meeting being about the preparation of the Natsgvardia divisions to resume actions on the armistice line. He walked along to his accustomed seat, but didn't sit down immediately. Sat across the table from him were Shikmatov, Shepilov and Vernadsky. Pavel Timofeyovich wasn't sure which he loathed more, out of that quiver of vipers.\n\nShikmatov reached to adjust his spectacles, and pulled a document off the pile that was to his right, then signed it, passing it to Shepilov. A second signature was scrawled on, Shepilov barely looking at the paper, before passing it to Vernadsky.\n\nPavel Timofeyovich felt like the collar of his uniform was too tight suddenly as Vernadsky gave him a long look and their eyes met. Then Vernadsky glanced down, and put a third signature on the paper. Shepilov cleared his throat.\n\n'By Special Troika we find you, Pavel Timofeyovich Gorgulov, guilty of spreading defeatism, undermining the Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom, of betraying our beloved Vozhd, Boris Viktorevich Savinkov, of attacking Holy Russia and -'\n\n Gorgulov howled with rage and threw the chair aside and moved to clamber onto the broad table to try and throttle Shepilov as he heard the Natsgvardia guards in the room drawing their pistols. They were going to shoot those swine across the table, surely?\n\nHe kept moving as they all leapt to their feet, pushing their chairs backward, Shepilov stumbling as the furniture tangled his legs. Then Gorgulov felt a hand on his ankle and he was roughly pulled back and thrown to the floor. A hardened leather boot tip kicked him in the ribs and knocked the wind out of him, and then his mouth was stuffed with cloth and a sack pulled over his head. A kick to the back of his head put Pavel Timofeyovich reeling, as he distantly heard Shikmatov barely keeping his voice calm as he spoke."
krg_rus_rwk.23.a: "Take him away and dispose of him..."

krg_rus_rwk.24.t: "Called to the Vozhd's Office"
krg_rus_rwk.24.d: "The intense gaze of Savinkov struck Yuri Alexeevich as he walked into the office of the Vozhd. Then his heart sank as he saw [RUS_Spymaster] standing beside him. The Natsgvardia men already had their pistols in hand and Yuri Alexeevich felt the blood drain from his face. He was already dead, he knew it. Walking, breathing... but dead.\n\nThe Vozhd slammed the desk with his fist and howled for a moment, then his breath ran ragged and he was wracked by a spasming cough. Flecks of blood flew from his lips as he leaned against the desk, still staring at Yuri Alexeevich.\n\n\"You know. I could believe it of the other two. But you?\"\n\nSavinkov was overtaken by a cough again, with [RUS_Spymaster] handing him a cloth to cover his mouth that Savinkov pushed away from him badtemperedly. The documents on the desk were ruined now, with little pockmarks of red, red blood. Savinkov slowly drew himself up to his full height.\n\n\"Yuri Alexeevich... do you not even have anything to say for yourself?\"\n\nYuri Alexeevich dropped to his knees... perhaps he had a chance. But [RUS_Spymaster] clicked his fingers and the Natsgvardia men pulled him back up as [RUS_Spymaster] interjected. \"Stand like a man for God's sake\"\n\nHe thought about what he could say for a moment and as he did all his ideas ran away from him like frightened animals from a hunting party.\n\nHe could only show his resolve now, and he looked Savinkov in the eye, silently.\n\nThe old man returned his gaze, then finally took the cloth and started to wipe at his lips, swallowing some blood and then with apparent regret he made a dismissive gesture. The Natsgvardia men started to drag him out of the room and he saw Savinkov look to [RUS_Spymaster], and speak one final time."
krg_rus_rwk.24.a: "Prepare the trial..."

krg_rus_rwk.25.t: "The Lying Game Begins"
krg_rus_rwk.25.d: "The meeting of the Presidium was humdrum enough. Brezhnev muttered some remarks about the ongoing economic issues the country was facing, a shortage of boots, razorblades and the biting effect of international sanctions on chocolate rations. Shepilov gave a sly glance to Vernadsky, and then Shikmatov. Savinkov seemed unfocused as he sat in his chair, rolling his cigarette back and forth between his fingers over the ash-tray. After Brezhnev finished they all agreed that further steps needed to be taken.\n\nShepilov cleared his throat and then looked to Savinkov. 'The Justice Ministry, in co-ordination with the Interior Ministry...'\n\nZankevich looked up from his cigarette idly, but nodded and said nothing.\n\n'Have come to the damning conclusion that the arch-defeatist and traitor was not in fact, Rodion Malinovsky.' \n\nSavinkov seemed to wake up, looking to Shepilov with keen interest, his eyes narrowing slightly as he listened.\n\n'We have found that Pavel Timofeyovich Gorgulov... was in fact exploiting his trusted position by your side to destroy our revolution from within, using his security forces to destroy the true strength of the nation, and purge out those in opposition of his defeatest plans... We have however managed to remove him, via the special troika mechanism, and the assistance of the new head of the Natsgvardia...' \n\nShepilov nodded to the guards by the door and Savinkov's gaze followed quickly. The doors opened and a man in Natsgvardia uniform entered then calmly moved to the vacant seat that was once Gorgulov's. He looked to Savinkov and gave him a smart salute before speaking.\n\n'Yakov Isaakevich Serebryansky, my Vozhd. Do not fear, we are already working on removing the arch-defeatist's machinery from within the Natsgvardia.'\n\nSavinkov seemed to be stunned a moment, after this denouement and the introduction of Serebryansky. Then he distractedly waved to the vacant seat.\n\n'Very good. Very good...' Savinkov murmured. 'Well done.'\n\nShepilov glanced to Vernadsky then Shikmatov coughed before he spoke."

krg_rus_rwk.26.t: "The Emergency Trial of Pavel Timofeyovich Gorgulov"
krg_rus_rwk.26.d: "As he stepped through the door to the Presidium, Pavel Timofeyovich wished for a moment that he had not handed in his gun to the guard on the door. He hadn't recognised the man, though he was wearing a Natsgvardia uniform. Perhaps a new recruit in the Kremlin guards. The Natsgvardia were supposed to trust in him, and the Vozhd alone. But the Vozhd wasn't there, despite the meeting being about the preparation of the Natsgvardia divisions to resume actions on the armistice line.

krg_rus_rwk.27.t: "The Palace Coup"
krg_rus_rwk.27.d: "The orders had been dispatched in preparation for the [RUS_sacred_war_real] of the Sacred War to resume for Russia's western lands, and the night had been full of noise as troops were mobilising. Boris Viktorevich couldn't sleep in his bed, his cough being worse than ever. So he was awake, pacing around his bedroom in his night clothes when several soldiers entered his apartment. They glanced around, energetic and moving quickly. He knew that look, but they had caught him away from his desk, so he didn't have his pistol to hand. He narrowed his eyes and slowly put his hands up.\n\n'So, the defeatists have come for me at last'\n\nA young corporal looked at him oddly for a moment, then saluted.\n\n'I have orders here for your security sir. You're to be held in protective custody while we remove the defeatist clique that has infiltrated the Natsgvardia and restore the rightful workings of government.'\n\nBoris Viktorevich's mind whirled. His brows knitted together... he looked to his nightstand and then lowered his hands. He took the packet of cigarettes and then walked over to the armchair by the fireplace, pulling a cigarette out and then looking around for a lighter. The young corporal stepped forward and offered him his own.\n\nSavinkov glanced up at him a moment, then drew from the light and leant back into his chair, thinking to himself as he heard the distant sound of gunshots."
krg_rus_rwk.27.a: "So it comes to this?"

krg_rus_rwk.28.t: "An extension is agreed on!"
krg_rus_rwk.28.d: "Vernadsky's relief was palpable. The other two didn't even need to ask, but he told them anyway, in a hushed whisper in the corner of the meeting room, while Brezhnev was giving a report on the dire economic state of the country and Gorgulov was out of the room. \"The Germans seem to have gotten their fill of our blood and will sign an extension of the Armistice. Now we just need to keep it a secret...\" Shikmatov glanced over at his shoulder at the sleeping figure of Savinkov, who spasmed with a cough after a moment."

krg_rus_rwk.30.d: "At 5 o'clock Moscow time, Vozhd Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was found dead in his quarters. An official autopsy declared that the Vozhd had died from complications of lung cancer. While his illness may have been an official state secret, it was no surprise to some to learn that Vozhd Savinkov was suffering from cancer. He was a heavy smoker all throughout his life and towards the end of it, suffered from violent coughing fits and a sudden loss in weight. It's unknown if Savinkov ever sought treatment for his ailment, but now it's far too late. \n\nThe Vozhd is dead.

krg_rus_rwk.32.d: "Forced to sign a disgraceful treaty, the Trial was held almost immediately afterward to ascertain who was responsible for Russia's shame. Savinkov, and the Troika made sure they were well away from the Docket. The matter therefore depended on who had crippled their masterful plans and betrayed glorious Russia.\n\nThe judge was of course as much a mouthpiece as the guilty party was guaranteed to be a scapegoat for the wider failings of the Russian war effort at large."

krg_rus_rwk.33.a: "A bullet to the back of the head."

krg_rus_rwk.34.t: "The New Lists"
krg_rus_rwk.34.d: "Vernadsky felt mild revulsion in the back of his throat... or was it heart burn? Either way, the way that Shikhmatov and Shepilov relished the list that had been presented to them, that they were going down, was positively ghoulish. Vendettas had come to the surface, now that the Old Man was unwell more frequently. He hadn't made it to a meeting for a few weeks now, though the Doctors assured Georgiy he was hanging in there just fine. Just feeble.\n\n The few who had crossed Shikhmatov or Shepilov over the years and not already been swept up were now going to feel the broom it seemed. He tried not to listen, but some of it crept in.\n\n'Shoot her before him, but make sure he sees it.'\nThey rustled the papers between them, passing the sheets across the table as they looked to an officer who stood waiting to enact the order. Vernadsky reached for his vodka.\n'Oh, and this one, kill him, take him to his church and dump him in the pulpit.'\n\nGeorgiy Vladimirovich took the swig and used the burning liquid as an excuse to sigh. He tried to sound as bored instead of sickened as he glanced at one of the lists and noticed a pianist whose work he rather enjoyed was to be caught in the latest dragnet."

krg_rus_rwk.41.t: "Failure of the Offensive"
krg_rus_rwk.41.d: "The time has come, the blood of the Russians is about our knees. It has not been the resounding victory we hoped for, but Savinkov's authority is done.\n\nWe will have to live with the previous position and go on from there. It appears that Russia is not yet completely finished." 
krg_rus_rwk.41.a: "We shall return."

krg_rus_rwk.42.t: "The Reichspakt resumes the war with Russia!"
krg_rus_rwk.42.d: "The enigmatic leadership of Russia have apparently been in some kind of negotiation with the German Empire, one that has failed to conclude satisfactorily. The German Army this morning reported Russian shelling on their positions and began counter-fire into Russia, declaring the Armistice between the two sides to have been violated and a 'Continuation War' to be the current state of affairs.\n\nThe exact details of the matter are not clear right now, but it appears that the Vozhd, Boris Savinkov, who has not been seen in public, has decided to force the matter of Russian claims in Eastern Europe once more.\n\nGerman diplomatic sources are being tight-lipped regards further details at this time, but Savinkov's willingness to risk a nuclear counter-attack speaks volumes to his sanity."
krg_rus_rwk.42.a: "Alea Iacta Est"

krg_rus_rwk.43.t: "Savinkov disappears from view"
krg_rus_rwk.43.d: "The leader of Russia, Boris Savinkov, has apparently been sequestered by his own government. The seemingly constant stream of speeches, announcements and proclaimations that have issued forth from the Kremlin has been replaced by flat, measured communiques from official state offices and occasional remarks from high ranking officials in his government. The man himself however is nowhere to be seen.\n\nNew ambassadors are reportedly being handled by the Deputy Leader of the Party, Tysyatsky Yuri Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, while Foreign Minister Georgiy Vernadsky has recently taken on a higher profile in international negotiations. There are also rumblings about potential codification of doctrine under the Justice Minister, Dimitri Shepilov. This Russian Triumvirate seem to be, if not completely in charge, certainly taking care of the shop."
krg_rus_rwk.43.a: "How curious..."

krg_rus_rwk.44.t: "Savinkov has died!"
krg_rus_rwk.44.d: "The leader of Russia, Boris Savinkov, has died. In a statement given to the Russian people by the Tysyatsky Yuri Shirinsky-Shikmatov, the state autopsy declared that the Vozhd had died from complications of lung cancer.\n\nThe Vozhd is dead. In accordance with Russian State law, all radio shows have been canceled for the rest of the week to air memorial services and somber discussion on the legacy of Boris Viktorovich Savinkov.\n\nAround the rest of the world, many a glass has been raised, as most people celebrate that the madman has finally released his grip on life. Perhaps Russia can know peace under his successors?"
krg_rus_rwk.44.a: "Sure..."

krg_rus_rwk.45.t: "The Russian Winter Falls"
krg_rus_rwk.45.d: "With the declaration of the Secret Police Chief of the SZRS's Natsgvardia, Pavel Gorgulov, as 'Vozhd' of Russia after an explosion rocked a meeting of the government, killing the leading Troika as they discussed the affairs of state, it was not going to be long before an opponent crawled out of the woodwork to seize the leadership of Russia.\n\nWar Hero and respected Field Marshal, Nikolai Vatutin has pledged to bring down the 'corrupt SZRS-Natsgvardia' regime, in a rare public communique to international press from a serving Russian military officer. One can only wonder at the chaos that now roams the land within the country."
krg_rus_rwk.45.a: "And brother kills brother..."

krg_rus_rwk.46.t: "The Ostwall Reborn"
krg_rus_rwk.46.d: "With the explosion of the Russian State into another bloody civil war, the members of the Reichspakt that border the distressed country have advanced into the territory held by the Russians since the Armistice was signed, taking back the 1936 borders and overwhelming the undermanned, underfed remnants of the Russian border guard service. Prisoners taken reported that the majority of forces had been called east to quell the Army uprising, those who remained loyal to the SZRS anyway. Several border posts were unmanned entirely, except by corpses.\n\nOnce the soldiers passed the armistice line they reported finding a land still scarred with the ruin of the Weltkrieg and with further depredation by the Russian State's military and paramilitary forces, and from the ruins of towns and villages the people advanced and greeted them as liberators."
krg_rus_rwk.46.a: "Barbarism unearthed..."

krg_rus_rwk.47.t: "Signing the Treaty"
krg_rus_rwk.47.d: "With the death of the Vozhd, we can no longer delay signing the Treaty any longer. The Germans are already starting to make menacing remarks in diplomatic communiques about our failure to keep our promises. We had best put ink to paper and make good."
krg_rus_rwk.47.a: "Who will we blame this on?!"

krg_rus_rwk.48.t: "De-Savinkovisation"
krg_rus_rwk.48.d: "The soldiers pulled down the portrait that had looked over Red Square since 1936, and across the nation today, the framed picture of Savinkov in every classroom, hotel and state institution was taken down. Many were tossed out unceremoniously, with a few particularly vindictive survivors burning their copies. Russia has gone through many shocks, but with the recent arrest of Zankevich and the clean up of the once fearsome Natsgvardia, this one was not a surprise.\n\nBoris Savinkov's War of Reclamation, the Great Patriotic War of the People's Revolutionary Army, was a shocking waste of blood and treasure because he pushed an unready nation into the breach. Everything after that was an increasingly desperate coverup by fools and thugs as the Old Man lost his marbles."
krg_rus_rwk.48.a: "This is what we have come to."

krg_rus_rwk.49.t: "The [GetYear] Constitution"
krg_rus_rwk.49.d: "While the SZRS was not really an organisation famed for paperwork and documentation, Shepilov did leave a draft document of a Constitution in his papers which were retrieved after the unfortunate incident with the Troika. These files were then stored in the state archive.\n\nGiven the chaotic and seemingly endless trials that have beset Russia since 1948, a statement of stability in the institution of a new constitutional document might provide the people with a sensation of trust in the new regime. Of course, we will remove the references to the guiding light of National Populism, the need for a nation of Svobodniks and any reference to the SZRS.\n\nThe question becomes, do we wish to add in references to the key role of the KORA in the structure of the nation, and it's leader Nikolai Vatutin... or do we prefer to keep the document 'clean' of such self-aggrandising."
krg_rus_rwk.49.a: "A clean constitution will do"
krg_rus_rwk.49.b: "Without her Army, Russia is nothing."
krg_rus_rwk.49.c: "Vatutin deserves his praise with the Army."

krg_rus_mil.0.t: "Military Commission on the Great Patriotic War."
krg_rus_mil.0.d: "A military commission into the army's performance in the Great Patriotic War has concluded today after over a month of secret deliberation in the Kremlin.\n\nEvidence was heard from bureaucrats, SZRS party members, and military officers on failings and shortcomings of the Russian State and its armed forces during the war.  Between a lacklustre pre-war buildup and SZRS interference in the day to day operations of the military much blame can be placed on the SZRS, the Army is also not without blame however with turf wars between generals, a broken promotion and recruitment structure and wasteful practices costing Russia victory more than once during the war.\n\nWhile the full report that lays out all the facts remains only in possession of a select few, the decision needs to be made about what the public report will say. Will the blame be placed on the Armed forces or the SZRS?"
krg_rus_mil.0.a: "Political intrrference cost us the war."
krg_rus_mil.0.b: "Incompetent officers cost us the war."

krg_rus_mil.1.t: "A New Russian Army."
krg_rus_mil.1.d: "The new Vozhd of Russia Nikolai Vatutin has today announced a set of sweeping reforms for the Russian Army that hope to rid it of political interference and ineffectualism. These new set of laws and procedural reforms have banned political commissars, forbidden government officials from removing officers from their post and established an independent court to oversee any future officer misconduct or removals. The Vohzd has also instructed the military to reform senior staff behavior to reduce wastefulness, infighting and encourage promotion only on merit.\n\nWhether or not these reforms bear fruit and produce a new and improved army is yet to be seen but the future hopes of Russia's military success depends on it."
krg_rus_mil.1.a: "A new army free from political meddling."

krg_rus_mil.2.t: "A Scythian Army."
krg_rus_mil.2.d: "We shall model our military on the might of the Scythians horse lords of old! Our men will be outfitted for mobility. Our command structure will allow for loyal autonomy. Our logistics will be thorough. Our discipline will lead our soldiers to fight through hunger and thirst. Our tactics will lead them to victory!"
krg_rus_mil.2.a: "Strike hard, strike fast, strike true!"

krg_rus_mil.3.t: "The Legacy of Alexander Kolchak."
krg_rus_mil.3.d: "For much of Russia's history, the navy has been a lesser and secondary part compared to the rest of the military. Admiral Alexander Kolchak changed that. Kolchak made a name for himself throughout the 20th century, working to rebuild the Imperial fleet after the disastrous 1905 Russo-Japanese War, to fighting in the First World War, and subsequently, the Russian Civil War. His service during the Russian Civil War made him a war hero by his many victories against the Bolsheviks. His experience, added with his popularity, greatly helped Kolchak maneuver the political atmosphere of the time and grant him great influence in Russia. With the failure of the bolsheviks and the Russian Republic surviving the civil war, Kolchak continued his naval career. He headed the Naval General Staff and was vital to forming the modern Russian Navy throughout the 1920s. WHen war inevitably began with Germany, Kolchak's Navy proved to be capable of countering the renowned German Navy, and experiencing success in many operations. By the late 1940s, the Russian Navy continues its expansion, following Kolchak's design, and his legacy is cemented within Russia as a respected Admiral and war hero."
krg_rus_mil.3.a: "Farewell to an exceptional man."

krg_rus_mil.4.t: "A modern military industry."
krg_rus_mil.4.d: "By the end of the Russian Civil War and the rise of Savinkov, the Russian Military Industrial Complex has greatly expanded. Throughout much of Russia's history, the industrial sector had been weak and inefficient. This weakness was exposed during the First World War, posing to be one of the biggest reasons for Russia's failure in the war. Following Russia's departure from the war and the subsequent revolution and civil war, the industrial sector was all but decimated. It proved to be a challenge for the fragile and young Russian Republic to rebuild and modernize the industrial sector after the civil war, though industrialization continued, albeit slowly. With the rise of Boris Savinkov, the importance of industry was a forefront of his presidency, and he promised to rapidly modernize and expand Russia's industry to eventually be on par with Germany. Savinkov's plans for his Russian State were propelled by the prospect of war with Germany, and when the war inevitably came, Russia's military complex rapidly enlarged to fulfill the needs of Savinkov's 'Great Patriotic War'. The mass industrialization of Russia greatly accelerated her modernization, giving birth to a new and modern industry."
krg_rus_mil.4.a: "To a new and prosperous Russia!"

Unfortunately almost all leaders of the government were in attendance at the time, and the Troika are no more.\n\n However, the Chief of the Natsgvardia, Pavel Gorgulov was at the Palace of Justice attending to some other business, and is the lone survivor of the SZRS's highest echelon.

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 19th, 1879\nKharkov, Kharkov Governorate, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThe Commander-in-Chief. The Pale Horseman. The Vozhd.\n\nBoris Savinkov goes under many names, but he is known by all. Once a terrorist and anti-Bolshevik, who solidified as a nationalist demagogue during the dark days of the Russian Republic, Savinkov became known as the leader of the peasants. Penning the ideology of 'National Populism' with his '18 Demands', his SZRS began to gain masses of ground in the 20s and 30s. Riding a wave of peasant anger following the Tambov Rebellion, Savinkov would be swept to power in 1934.\n\nOver the next few years, the Vozhd would consolidate his authority, especially after the barbaric assassination of long-time rival Viktor Chernov. Rapid industralisation would follow, with the goal of turning the flagging Russian economy into fully-fledged war machine. Leftist politicians would be purged or co-opted, 'German Organisations' were crushed, and widespread land reform would bolster industrialisation efforts.\n\nRevanchism ran high, and the conquests would quickly follow. Central Asia was easy to crush, and border incidents only emboldened Savinkov's actions. Then came the biggest gamble of his life: War with the Reichspakt. \n\nThe Great Patriotic War started strong, with Russian forces marching through Eastern Europe. The tide would turn at Konigsberg and Odesa, and the later years of the war would become a grinding defence, with Savinkov throwing millions to halt the German comeback. In the end, a ceasefire on the Dniepr in early 1947 would end the war for Russia, and left Savinkov's authority greatly weakened.\n\nRussia's war economy might be on the verge of collapse, and political discontent against the regime is growing fast, but the Vozhd's personality cult has held everything together. However, secretly, Savinkov himself is falling apart. Every day his mind fades, his demands become more ridiculous, and his health declines. To his closest advisors, the truth is obvious. Savinkov will be lucky to reach the next decade. But to everyone else:\n\n§RThe Vozhd is Eternal.§!"

POLITICS_RUS_TROIKA_DESC: "With the death of Vozhd Boris Savinkov, no one man could fill the shoes of Russia's favourite son. Thus, in the corridors of the Moscow Kremlin, a political alliance has been formed to oversee a smooth transition of power. The three most powerful men in the new Russia: Tysyatsky Yuri Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, General Secretary Dmitri Shepilov and Foreign Minister Georgiy Vernadsky.\n\nThe Troika.\n\nWith this renewed imposition of authority, the fractious Party has been brought to heel for the moment and peace reigns across Russia. However, machinations are afoot. The three men are known to be ideologically opposed to each other, all with their own interpretations of Savinkov's writings and ideas. Alliances are being formed, deals are being made and key officials are mysteriously committing suicide. The Troika kept the SZRS in control of Moscow and Russia, for now, but as tensions rise in the Kremlin the Troika may be their own undoing."

POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VATUTIN_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 16th, 1901\nChepukhino, Voronezh Governorate, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThe Commander-in-Chief. The Vozhd.\n\nNew Boss, same as the old boss? Nobody is sure.\n\nField Marshal Vatutin has risen to power on the coat-tails of the SZRS and his war conduct is unblemished, and yet there is a sense that now he is in charge, he sees a different future for Russia than the one mapped out by Savinkov, Gorgulov or the Troika...\n\nSavinkov had cast aside greater men who got too popular. But perhaps he got soft with age, and now Russia has a Vozhd who is no fan of his old boss."
POLITICS_PAVEL_GORGULOV_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 29th, 1985\nLabinsk, Russian Empire\n§W--------------§!\nThe Secret Police Chief. The Vozhd? Surely not?\n\nPavel Gorgulov is not a stable man. He is quick to anger, resorts to violence often, and is almost worryingly fanatical. Perhaps that is the reason why he was chosen to lead the Natsgvardia, or National Guard. The successors of Savinkov's Combat Squads, the Natsgvardia is the military arm of the SZRS and has an appaling record of atrocities during the Second Weltkrieg and against it's own people. While Gorgulov may be the first to jump at an occasion to speak the praises of the party, his rhetoric often strays wildly from the Vozhd's own ideology. The energetic Commissar often speaks of Russia as a land of \"Barbarians, Peasants, and Scythians\", who must \"throw off the shackles of civilization with extreme violence!\""
