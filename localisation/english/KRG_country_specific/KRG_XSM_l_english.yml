 ### Ideas ###
 XSM_the_horse_clique: "The 'Horse' Clique"
 XSM_the_horse_clique_desc: "It's well known that 'Ma' translates to 'Horse', and it seems almost prophetic that the Ma Clique's armies are dominated by Cavalry. A lack of industry and a legacy of nomadic lifestyles has enshrined the importance of horseback soldiers, something that has been encouraged by Ma Bufang's military reforms. It is said that Ma Cavalry is the best in the world, and though that may just be propaganda it's undeniable that our 'Qibing' divisions are lethal when used correctly."
 XSM_loss_of_faith: "Loss of Faith"
 XSM_loss_of_faith_desc: "When Tibet and Mongolia were defeated, the people of the three provinces looked to Bufang as a legendary figure, who had secured the Ma's position in the Northwest for generations. Now, the people have lost faith. Our alliances with Sichuan and Shanxi faded away, the Qing we supported so dearly were crushed from all sides, and Bufang's own aloofness to National Politics has only increased our isolation. Both Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin argue for us to change our direction, but for now Bufang seems destined to stubbornly march on regardless."

 XSM_bufangs_ambitions_desc: "For years, Ma Bufang has had his sights set on one thing: Xinjiang. With their ethnic troubles seemingly never-ending, and Han dominance only serving to worsen the conflicts, Bufang sees himself as the unifying figure the region needs to succeed. With his position looking shaky, Bufang believes a war to unite the Northwest will ensure he remains on top. All he needs is a casus belli, which seems impossible to come by under Liu Wenlong's administration..."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###

 POLITICS_MA_BUFANG_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\n1903\nHezhou, Gansu, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nWhere does one start with Ma Bufang? A moderniser who has brought Qinghai into the modern age. An islamist militarist who has managed to balance out the old Hui-Han ethnic divide, and saved his lands from the brink of defeat. A centralising general who has begun to alienate his own people. Bufang is all of these and many more.\n\nUsurping Qinghai from his uncle Ma Lin after the loss of Yushu to the Tibetans, Ma Bufang quickly got to work consolidating his power over the other Ma provinces. The recapture of Yushu was a cause for celebration, even if it was mostly thanks to the forces of Sichuan. His heavily criticised Suiyuan Deal, where Shanxi was permitted to re-occupy the region in exchange for military support, could have ended in disaster for Bufang. But instead, it sent the Mongolian troops into chaos, and ultimately ended the war in the Chinese's favour.\n\nWhen the war was won, Bufang's work wasn't over. Ending the rivalry between Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin wasn't easy, but by playing them off eachother Bufang was able to secure his position at the top of the clique. With industrialisation campaigns paying dividends, and strict policies on left-wing revolutionaries keeping destabilising influences at bay, the Ma Clique has flourished under his rule. However, his lack of commitment to the Beiyang Government during the Second Sino-Japanese War angered many, and his hardline positions are beginning to cause political stagnation. With Bufang setting his sights on expansionism to reinvigorate faith in his administration, anything but absolute victory is likely to bring the knives out once again."
