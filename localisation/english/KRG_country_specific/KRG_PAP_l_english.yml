After the formation of the Italian Republic the party's goals shifted from the establishment of a democratic republic to the reunification of all of Italy under the Republic. Even if they were born in prevalently liberal echelons, they don't shy away from the support of the more radical left.§!"

It includes bigger parties, such as the relatively moderate Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Syndical Union which ruled the SRI up to 1936, but also of smaller parties, such as the Socialist Maximalist Party and Unitary Socialist Union. Due to this, the actual position of the coalition shifts between moderate versions of Mussolini's socialism (despite the ban on such parties) and Turati's parliamentarism.§!"

 ### IDEAS ###
 
 PAP_the_papacy: "The Holy See"
 PAP_the_papacy_desc: "Shining through the ages, the Papacy remains the uncontested leadership of all the Catholic world and beyond. While the Papal State may be a minor power and our Government may lack true popular support, the respect the figure of the Pope commands far surpasses that of all Kings and Emperors. Of course, the Pope is no longer the all-powerful figure he was before the French revolution; nevertheless, we still reap all the benefits of swearing our loyalty to the Vicar of Christ on Earth."
 PAP_Pacellismo: "Pacellismo"
 PAP_Pacellismo_desc: "Since the fall of the Socialist Republic, our apparatus of state has followed a strictly reactionary, anti-democratic and anti-socialist agenda. It is informally known as Pacellismo in reference to the conservative religious and political positions of His Exellency Pius XII, who had an important role in the creation of such political system following the liberation of Rome in 1944. Under the formal guidance of the Bishop of Rome, a technocratic Commission composed by cardinals and military officials alike rules Latium, ignoring calls for democracy and actively suppressing opposition parties. Through an informal alliance with the Roman scions of the anti-political Common Man's Front and of the centrist People's Party, as well as the support of ultracatholic militias originating from the Socialist occupation, they also control local politics. All this, in order to ensure the seeds of revolution left by the Socialist Republic can't germinate; but it is clear that this has instead caused the radicalization of the opposition, and only time might stand before an open confrontation between the Commission and the people they are supposed to govern in the Pope's name."
 PAP_Pacellismo_tt: "§RWith democratic reforms turned down, the political scene of Latium will gradually radicalize.§!"
 PAP_defended_by_foreign_powers: "The Defense of Rome"
 PAP_defended_by_foreign_powers_desc: "Since the fall of the Socialist Republic our foreign policy has been based on a strict neutralism, a position reinforced by the hostile relations between Berlin and Ottawa.\nWith a great number of Catholic believers living under either bloc, neutrality was seen as the best option, in order not to graze the centrality of Rome.\n\nIt is however clear that our neutrality is tenuous at best, as ever since the creation of the Federation in 1920 the Two Sicilies have taken over the defense of Rome. As internal problems plague the southern Kingdom, the Holy See will have to find an alternative protector, else Latium be left at the mercy of the hungry nationalists in Milan and Turin."
 PAP_defended_by_foreign_powers_tt: "§RIn spite of our neutralist foreign policy, the survival of the Papal State will only be ensured by the presence of a nearby foreign military backer.§!"
 PAP_sardinian_papal_treaty: "The [ITA.GetAdjectiveCap]-Papal Treaty"
 PAP_sardinian_papal_treaty_tt: "§RTurin will intervene in Latium should any sign of instability manifest itself§!"
 PAP_the_reconstruction_of_rome: "The Reconstruction of Rome"
 PAP_the_reconstruction_of_rome_desc: "During the war, the city of Rome was one of the main goals of the Socialist Republic, due to its enormous historical significance as the natural capital of any Italian state; this led to stark battles in Latium, ending with the occupation of the Eternal City. In spite of the revolutionary fervour of the Socialist militants, the City was left alone due to a direct order by Mussolini himself, and the damage was minimal.\n\nWhat truly impacted the City was instead the retreat of the Socialist Republic in 1944. The retreating Socialist armies pillaged and plundered the whole of Latium, and great riches of Rome were seized by the socialist government. While we were able to eventually regain most of the stolen treasures, the damage done to Latium remains."
