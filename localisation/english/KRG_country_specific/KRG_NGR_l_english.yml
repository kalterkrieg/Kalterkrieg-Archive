krg_ngr_news.0.t: "Oil found in Calabar"
krg_ngr_news.0.d: "Exploratory drilling near the town of Eket in Calabar province of Nigeria has uncovered oil in the region.\n\nPlans are already being made to start a commercial well in order to start exploiting the territory for the benefit of the country and to add to the global oil flow. There are of course some who are dubious that this will not represent some kind of resource curse for Nigeria, but there are others who are optimistic that it will allow the fledgling country to take control of it's balance of payments."
