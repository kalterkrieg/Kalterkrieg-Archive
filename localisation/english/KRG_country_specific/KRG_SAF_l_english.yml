#National Spirits
SAF_white_minority_rule: "White Minority Rule"
SAF_white_minority_rule_desc: "South African white minority rule has been an institution since before the beginning of the Union, with the Anglo-Afrikaner societal structure dominating the majority-black country as well as the various ethnic minorities that compose South Africa. While enforcement has varied over both the history of South Africa and the various regions, with certain groups such as the 'Cape Coloured' community possessing limited forms of franchise, the question of whether or not this minority rule should be enforced is not one of political debate— it simply is a fact of life in the country. However, recently, with the liberalization of South African politics under the United Party and beginning of reforms towards greater franchise for non-white groups spearheaded by Deputy Prime Minister Hofmeyr, the topic has once more re-entered the table of debate.\n\nWhile most in the dominant United Party are not supportive of universal suffrage or majority rule, they have come to accept that some reforms are necessary. To their left, the Labour Party has taken things a step further after a crises of politics between the pro-reform Madeley and pro-segregation Creswell, with their platform including support for integrated labor unions and reform of segregationist laws. To their right, however, the recently reunified Reunited National Party sees any action of reform as antithetical to the system of South Africa, and many members (including its leader, D.F. Malan) support the tightening of these laws. And, of course, those currently disenfranchised by this policy have not been idle while their rights are debated. While organizations to push for opposition to white minority rule suffered in the 1930s, they have begun to grow in size, particularly as the looser policies of the government have emboldened them. Whatever the solution, it is likely that it will be the center of the South African national debate for quite some time, and what will ultimately happen is a mystery..."
SAF_afrikaner_nationalism: "Resurgent Afrikaner Nationalism"
SAF_afrikaner_nationalism_desc: "Afrikaner nationalism, as an idea, stretches back to the independent Boer Republics and their resistance to rule by the British Empire (an ultimately futile resistance, as their ruling groups would later be integrated into the Union of South Africa) in the First and Second Boer Wars. However, simply because their efforts were stymied by the British, this does not mean that the movement is dead nor that it is on any sort of a decline. Quite the contrary is true, as the movement has grown in recent years in opposition to the policies of the ruling United Party, which those in the Afrikaner nationalist movement see as detrimental to their efforts to create an Afrikaner national state. Despite the fact that the Afrikaner community is split on support for the United and National Parties, the recently-unified National Party has seen the greatest success in harnessing this movement as many of its leadership are part of the most radical of Afrikaner nationalist groups. While the movement has been kept out of power by Jan Smuts and his United Party, a success for the National Party could see the implementation of Afrikaner nationalist policies and goals, a move likely to cause further complications for the country."
SAF_divided_party: "A Divided Party"
SAF_divided_party_desc: "Originally formed in order to coalesce like-minded groups into a big-tent, socially conservative party, the United Party has struggled to live up to its name since its inception. Indeed, the only thing keeping the party together since the 1930s and through the Second Weltkrieg has been the moderating influence of Jan Smuts, a figure looming large in South African politics. However, as he begins to age and reach the time of his retirement from South African politics, the internal fractures of the United Party have become more obvious. The most notable of these are the divides between the more liberal wing of the party, led by his protege and steadfast ally Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, and the former members of the National Party under Colin Fraser Steyn, a pressure point which has grown from internal policy debates to almost-daily open arguments on the floor of Parliament and threats of the formation of new parties. Besides these two are other internal factions, including the pro-British Whitehead faction and Smuts' own Liberal Conservatives, who each have their own goals and disagreements with the other sections of the party. While Smuts has been able to hold together his party thus far, primarily due to his prestige and quality as a statesman, it remains to be seen if this can continue... or what will happen when Smuts is gone."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 14th, 1870\nBovenplaats, Cape Colony\n§W--------------§!\nCommando. Statesman. Veteran of both Weltkriegs. Philosopher. Academic. Botanist. Field Marshall. Prime Minister. All terms that describe Jan Christiaan Smuts, though the last one describes his present occupation the most accurately.\n\nBorn to a wealthy Afrikaner farming family in the Cape Colony, Jan Smuts first distinguished himself in his education, studying at first Victoria College in Stellenbosch, then Cambridge, before eventually returning to South Africa to practice law. Smuts would go on to be involved in both the Second Boer War and the peace talks, which would allow him to propel himself through careful negotiations into the head of the Union Defence Force in the First World War. While South Africa would find itself defeated indirectly during the war, losing all her gains, he would keep the Union together through a number of crises after being selected as her Prime Minister. However, due to his handling of these crises, he would be removed for a period of five years, before coming back to politics in 1929 and cementing his position.\n\nIn this place he has dominated South African politics for twenty years, initially under the South African Party before uniting with J.B.M. Hetzog to form the United Party (which Hertzog would promptly leave due to South African entry into the Second Weltkrieg). During his tenure he has overseen a number of reforms, both regarding the slight loosening of racial politics and the modernization of South Africa's economy, creating a South Africa truly ready to enter the modern era. Despite this, while it was spared the horrors of the Weltkrieg, South Africa has begun to tire under Smuts, and it is not an uncommon belief that change must come. Many still, though, believe he is the only thing holding everything together. Regardless of opinion, however, all can agree on one question that must be asked...\n\nWhat happens when Smuts is gone?"
