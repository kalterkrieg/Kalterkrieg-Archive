POLITICS_GENDUN_CHOMPE_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nOctober 24th, 1903\nRebgong, Qinghai Province, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nGendun Chompe is sure that people can not predict their fate, but should take into account the flows of history. He absolutely did not know how he became the Sikyong of new Tibet from an enlightenment philosopher and writer. But the people had decided with a landslide vote: they wanted someone new.\n\nRaised as a reincarnated soul boy of Tulku Jigme Sonam Dorje, Gundun Chompe started his religious education when he was eleven and entered Labrang Monastery, the most prestigious academy of Vajrayana studies at an unusually young age of 18.  Tutored by Tibet's most prominent Buddhist philosophers, he showed genius oratory talent and eventually outargued them. Almost expelled from Labrang due to unorthodox views, he impressed Indian visiting scholar Rahul Sankrityayan, who invited him to Free India in 1934. There, this rebellious young scholar explored modern political ideas, including socialism, to save Tibet from theocracy and played a significant role in the foundation of the Tibetan Improvement Party, quitting later to pursue his academic career. He translated Buddhist classics, writing histories on the history of the ancient Tibetan Empire while He finished his famous yet controversial Passion Book, discussing the philosophy of love and sex. \n\nAfter meeting with General Zhang Fakui in Delhi, the fire of revolution in him was rekindled. He returned to Tibet when he heard news of the peasant rebellion against the Bolshevik correctionists and illegitimate regent Taktra. Joining the rebels of Alliance for Bodpa National Unity and Liberation (ABNUL), he rose to the most influential revolutionary instigator and the liaison between TIP and ABNUL with his speech skills, playing a decisive role in liberating Tibet and restoring Dalai Lama. Becoming the second Sikyong since the Tibetan Revolution with a landslide vote, this rebellious scholar faces a series of problems: insurgency, a backward economy, Han-Tibetan relations, and border disputes. This political outsider still has a long way to go."

TIB_bloodbathed_plateau: "Bloodbathed Plateau"
TIB_bloodbathed_plateau_desc: "Since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933, the Ganden Phodrang government had eight regime changes. It is confusing to explain all these whos, hows and whys. In short:\n§ILungshar Dorje Tsegyal§! overthrew §SThubten Kumphela§!.\n§lTrimön Norbu Wangyal§! overthrew §ILungshar§!. \n§Z5th Reting Rinpoche§! overthrew §lTrimön§!.\n§lTsarong Dzasa§! overthrew §ZReting§!. \n§gKelsang Tsering§! overthrew §lTsarong§!. \n§ANicholas Roerich§! overthrew §gKelsang§!.\n§l3rd Taktra Rinpoche§! overthrew §ARoerich§!. \nGanden Phodrang was finally stabilized in 1943 by §RPüncog Wanggyai§! and his serf rebels united under the reincarnated soul boy of Dalai Lama exiled by §ARoerich§!. \nThis might not be the last one.\nEight regime changes left a deep shadow in the minds of Tibetan people, who resorted to radicalism in the era of crisis, turmoil, and poverty. Liberated serfs bloodwashed their former masters, who responded by joining the §rChushi Gangdruk§!, the pro-independence, anti-revolutionary rebellion led by hardline nationalist §rAndrug Gompo Tashi§!. The toxic polarization intoxicated the halls of the legislature, Tsongdu Gyendzom, fanning the flame of distrust within the already fragile democratic united front,  §3Alliance for Bodpa National Unity and Liberation§!. At present, the hope of resolving political polarization and healing wounds falls on the teenage Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. However, Tsongdu Gyendzom soon discovers that the teenage Rinpoche has learned so much from the turbulent situation that he has become §Rmore than a spiritual leader§!..."

TIB_legal_ambiguity: "Legal Ambiguity"
TIB_legal_ambiguity_desc: "Our official name is Bödpa Idepa, which can be ambiguously translated to "State/Commission/Governorate/Authority of Tibet". That is only in theory. For most of our populace, we are still "Ganden Phodrang," the old name for the Lhasa government since the 17th century. Comrades in Guangzhou refer to us as the "Autonomous District of Tibet". Indian friends used the term "Lhasa People's Government." We were known to Beijing as the "Central Bodpa Autonomous Government of the Republic of China. " As if it wasn't complicated enough, westerners used the name "Bodpa People's Republic," or just "Lhasa." Simple as that.\nUnfortunately, all of them are correct. \nTheoretically, we should swear our loyalty to the Beiyang government, which does not acknowledge our legitimacy in favor of the aristocracy exiled in Beijing. Politically, economically and militarily tied to Guangzhou, we are a major section of their labyrinthine administrative framework. However, before we sort out our legal status under them, we must consult our former benefactor India, who had unsettled territorial disputes and security concerns despite officially acknowledging our association status in China.\nIn addition to heavy administrative burdens and uncertain policymaking prospects, this controversy reflected complex internal and external relationships around us that, if not tackled carefully, may spill more blood on our beloved plateau. and thus must be settled before we set our future course. Should the time is right, we will organize a multipartite negotiation in Chamdo, inviting all stakeholders for a consensus on our future."

TIB_development_gridlocks: "Development Gridlocks"
TIB_development_gridlocks_desc: "Revolution is not a dinner party, it can't feed you. Merely expelling theocrats into the mountains and redistributing their land to serfs is not enough to provide lives of dignity for all Tibetans. The countryside depends on subsistence farming of low-yielding highland barley. The urban industry is limited to small workshops in Lhasa. Trade is even more difficult due to the mountainous terrain. For the livelihood of the Tibetan people, our economy must grow beyond these. Lhalu Tsewang Dorje suggested we start with specialty agriculture. Thubten Kunphela saw the future in the Tashi Electric Machinery Plant he once administered. The teenage Dalai Lama had a more ambitious idea after seeing the mountain resorts of Haute-Savoie, Commune of France. Of course, without the infrastructure for external connections, these proposals are just pie in the sky."

TIB_tibetan_peoples_army: "Tibetan People's Army" 
TIB_tibetan_peoples_army_desc: "From guerrillas of humble dob-dobs and liberated serfs, our boys were forged upon the anvils of war. They had eliminated Bolshevik secret police, pulverized British mercenaries, crushed the aristocratic tyrants, and liberated our people in the name of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After the 1943 Revolution, we completely overhauled the ancient dmag-sgars with modern standards. Armed to the teeth with faith, revolutionary passion, and Lee-Enfields, they soon proved themselves the fiercest mountain fighters in Asia. Although few in number, these enthusiastic soldiers will become the backbone of our revolutionary cause."
