SER_macedonian_unrest: "Ethnic Unrest"
SER_macedonian_unrest_desc: "We regained our rightful territory of Macedonia following the Treaty of Dedinje in 1938, liberating it from illegal Bulgarian occupation. However, our rule of Macedonia has been marred with countless issues, as Bulgarian minorities refuse to recognise our rule. Various terrorist groups have sprung up throughout the region, and though the VMRO were crushed after a bloody partisan campaign there still remains countless cells opposed to the rule of the November 6th Dictatorship."
SER_november_6th_dictatorship: "The November 6th Dictatorship"
SER_november_6th_dictatorship_desc: "Proglumated after the Restoration, the November 6th Dictatorship has ruled the Serbian state for over a decade. Created by General and Royalist leader Petar Zivkovic, the regime is deeply conservative and statist in nature, forming a thinly veiled military junta that controls every facet of political life. With the Young King as a mere figurehead, the true power lies with the Prime Minister and his iron-fisted rule.\n\nWhen Serbia controverisally chose to cancel war preparations against the reformed, mobilised Danubian Federation in 1941, and Petar Zivkovic publicly split with ultranationalist leader Dimitrije Ljotić, the Dictatorship fell under political siege. Today, with opposition to the regime growing from every conceviable political camp, the November 6th Dictatorship largely only survives thanks to the ruthless leadership of the influential General who formed it."
SER_idea_belgrade_pact: "Belgrade Pact Member"
SER_idea_belgrade_pact_desc: "We are an integral part of the Belgrade Pact, a former triumvirate between ourselves, Greece & Romania. As Europe burned with revolution and the horrors of war, the Belgrade Pact reformed into a regional socio-economic bloc, leaving the military elements (mostly) by the wayside. However, our nations are still connected by a strong, cultural bond, and if the time comes where we need to protect our brothers, we will be by their side!"
SER_lack_of_industrialization: "Agrarian Nation"
SER_lack_of_industrialization_desc: "Even after the rearmament campaigns of the 20s and 30s, as well as our hegemony other the Balkans, our Economy lacks widespread industrialisation, remaining heavily agrarian even today. This economic status has been encouraged by the ZBOR, and even after the political break between Zivkovic and Ljotic industrialisation efforts have been sluggish. It will take years for us to truly modernise our economy."

krg_ser_news.1.t: "Vojvoda Petar Živković Passes Away"
krg_ser_news.1.d: "Vojvoda Petar Živković, the long term Prime Minister of Serbia and progenator of the authoritarian November 6th Dictatorship that has governed Serbia ever since the Karadordevic restoration, died last night at the age of 69.\n\nŽivković was long considered to be the stanchest Karadordevic loyalist within Serbia, having engineered two coups to keep the royal family in control of Belgrade. The Prime Minister ever since the 1936 Coup, Živković is largely responsible for the re-entrenchment of Royalist values and Serbia's successful reclamations during the Fourth Balkan War. Without him, its debatable whether Serbia would have garnered their current Balkan hegemony\n\nA figure celebrated and reviled in equal measure, the Vojvoda's firm hand has successfully steered the regime for the last 11 years. Many doubt his brother-in-law and successor Bogoljub Jevtić will be able to hold Serbia together with the same skill as the Vojvoda."
krg_ser_news.1.a: "Reclaimer or Tyrant?"

krg_ser_news.2.t: "King Petar's Coup d'État"
krg_ser_news.2.d: "The young, inexperienced King of Serbia Petar II shocked the world today, when he stormed the National Assembly with a contingent of loyal soldiers and overthrew the flagging November 6th Dictatorship after nearly 14 years of rule. Speaking in front of the National Assembly, Petar spoke of 'ending the injustices and tyranny that have been carried out in my Kingdom for far too long', and promised the swift liberalisation and democratisation of Serbia, along with the release of all political prisoners taken by the SRSD over the years.\n\nPetar II was considered to be an isolated figurehead used to legitimise the regime, and had very few powers of his own. However, with military and political support from the Accord, Petar was able to establish a powerbase to conduct the daring takeover of his own government. Already, meetings between the King and the various liberal groups of Serbia, including the largely royalist Radicals and Milovan Đilas's People's Socialist Party, are being arranged to put Petar's plans into action."
krg_ser_news.2.a: "Well, the King finally grew some balls."

krg_ser_news.3.t: "Serbia and Albania join the Accord"
krg_ser_news.3.d: "Following King Petar's Accord-backed Coup d'État in Serbia last year, there have been many questions as to when the nation would fully align itself with the Accord. Today, those questions were answered when the Kingdoms of Serbia and Albania formally entered into the alliance, following a short ceremony in Belgrade. In the treaty signed between the Balkan nations and the larger Accord, various stipulations were laid down. Chiefly, both countries would hold free elections within 18 months, owing to the lengthy democratisation processes both countries are going through following the dismantlement of the deep-rooted November 6th Regime.\n\nInternationally the news has been mixed. The Accordist leadership were quietly celebratory of the news, but the German Foreign Ministry claimed the Accord intended to dismantle the economic and political independence of Serbia. However, the historically Germanophobic kingdom was unfazed by their claims, and it seems Petar's liberalising mission is wholly genuine."
krg_ser_news.3.a: "The Cold War enters the Balkans"

krg_ser_news.4.t: "King Petar's Coup d'État"
krg_ser_news.4.d: "The young, inexperienced King of Serbia Petar II shocked the world today, when he stormed the National Assembly with a contingent of loyal soldiers and overthrew the flagging November 6th Dictatorship after nearly 14 years of rule. Speaking in front of the National Assembly, Petar spoke of 'ending the injustices and tyranny that have been carried out in my Kingdom for far too long', and promised the swift liberalisation and democratisation of Serbia.\n\nPetar II was considered to be an isolated figurehead used to legitimise the regime, and had very few powers of his own. However, with shocking military and political support from the Danubian Federation, long considered Serbia's greatest geopolitical enemy, Petar was able to establish a powerbase to conduct the daring takeover of his own government. Already, meetings between the King and the various liberal groups of Serbia, including the largely royalist Radicals and Milovan Đilas's People's Socialist Party, are being arranged to put Petar's plans into action."
krg_ser_news.4.a: "Well, the King finally grew some...hang on, Danubia?!"

krg_ser_news.5.t: "Signing of the Sarajevo Treaty"
krg_ser_news.5.d: "After 50 years of strife and bloodshed, it appears the hostilities between Vienna and Belgrade have culminated in peace. Signed in the same place a Serbian asssasin had triggered the Weltkrieg all those years ago, the bilateral Sarajevo Treaty between Serbia and the Danubian Federation guarantees the soverignty of current governments in Serbia and Albania. To achieve the Treaty, Serbia has had to drop its claims on territory within the Kingdom of Illyria, finally cementing the Drina River border that has existed de-facto since the end of the Austrian occupation.\n\nThe Treaty wasn't without opposition. Serbian nationalists and Pan-Slavists were outraged by both the negotiations and the outcome, as were Serbian minority leaders within Danubia. The success of the treaty paves the way for further negotiations with the rest of the Belgrade Pact, chiefly the Kingdom of Romania which still claims Transylvania and Hungarian territory. Peace reigns in the Balkans."
krg_ser_news.5.a: "The eternal rivalry comes to a diplomatic end?"

krg_ser_news.6.t: "The Sarajevo Conference Fails"
krg_ser_news.6.d: "After bilateral negotiations lasting several months, officials of the Danubian Federation had hoped that a treaty could be reached with their long-term geopolitical rival south of the Danube. However, between national claims and border control issues, it was not to be as both parties at the Sarajevo Conference failed to reach common ground.\n\nIn a debate that came out to national pride, with opposition from Serbian nationalists and Pan-Slavists alike, neither side could come to an acceptable arrangement. The news puts an end to the hopeful detente between the Belgrade Pact and Vienna, though the diplomatic negotiations undertaken have at least normalised international relations."
krg_ser_news.6.a: "Sadly, the expected outcome."

krg_ser_news.7.t: "Socialist Revolution in Serbia"
krg_ser_news.7.d: "In a shocking development, reports have emerged that Serbia has fallen to socialist revolutionaries. These revolutionaries originally rose up in the wake of the Montenegrin Uprising, and soon spread across the country while the paralyzed government was helpless to react.\n\nRevolutionaries have been able to successfully seize key buildings and infrastructure across the country, and soldiers are reportedly defecting to the revolutionaries. Violence has broken out across the country as firefights are reported in every city, and it is unclear in some cases who is winning this struggle.\n\nBoth Germany and the United Kingdom have stated that they are monitoring the situation, but intervention appears unlikely. Observers fear that many will die before order is restored, and the chaos subsides."
krg_ser_news.7.a: "Brothers against brothers."

krg_ser_news.8.t: "Nationalist Coup in Serbia"
krg_ser_news.8.d: "The Montenegrin Uprising saw the rise of socialist revolutionaries, who took advantage of a paralyzed government and international community reluctant to intervene, rapidly spreading and seizing much of the country. However, the rapid expansion of the socialists has galvanized a new force to counter a socialist takeover.\n\nNationalist groups and paramilitaries have begun coordinating and acting against the socialist revolutionaries, and have already reclaimed significant parts of the country. Swathes of the military have sided with them, seeing them as the only group capable of stopping the revolutionaries.\n\nThis sudden turn of fortune has sent the revolutionaries reeling, and it appears that when the dust settles, it will not be the revolutionaries controlling Serbia - but hardline nationalists."
krg_ser_news.8.a: "Surely it can't get worse?"

krg_ser_news.9.t: "Albania Breaks Away"
krg_ser_news.9.d: "Following the collapse of the Markagjoni government, and takeover of hardline Serbian nationalists of the country, Albanian officials made an unexpected announcement that they would be severing ties with Serbia and pursuing an independent path. They warned Belgrade from any unprovoked aggression against them, while also appealing to the international community for recognition.\n\nThis sudden break has been met with fury within Serbia, as officials and politicians are warning that there will be consequences, even as they work to rebuild the collapsed. Experts believe that Albania will continue appealing to the international community for support - but if they will get it before Serbia acts first is an open question."
krg_ser_news.9.a: "A risky gambit."

krg_ser_news.10.t: "Serbia Invades Albania"
krg_ser_news.10.d: "In a press conference with civil and military officials, Belgrade officially announced their intention to mobilize and invade Albania to depose the 'Accordist sympathizers and imperialists' that they claim had seized control of the Albanian government. Tirana strongly contests this claim, insisting they are only representing their own interests.\n\nSerbian forces have already crossed Albanian borders, and skirmishes are being reported across the small country. A state of emergency has been declared across Albania, and Albanian forces are mobilizing to defend against the encroaching Serbian army. Many fear that this will be a futile effort unless there is international intervention.\n\nWhile the Accord has condemned Serbia's invasion, so far the reaction has been limited to rhetoric, even as the world watches closely to see what the Accord may do next."
krg_ser_news.10.a: "What will they decide?"

krg_ser_news.11.t: "Accord Protects Albania"
krg_ser_news.11.d: "Under significant international and internal pressure, particularly from Greece who fears an unchecked Serbia may threaten their own territorial integrity, the Accord announced that Albania is under their protection, and demanded that all Serbian forces immediately withdraw, or face invasion from the Accord.\n\nThere are already reports that Accord nations are staging soldiers within Greece and nearby for a possible war in the Balkans, both to reinforce Albania, and invade Serbia. Germany has called for a ceasefire, but few expect that the situation will be resolved peacefully. With Serbia showing no signs of compliance, it is expected that both Serbia and the Accord will be at war within days."

krg_ser_news.14.t: "Socialist Revolution in Albania Crushed"
krg_ser_news.14.d: "It appears that calm has been restored to Albania, as German soldiers occupy the streets and cities of Albania while the last remnants of the short-lived socialist revolution are hunted down. Following the Markagjoni administration's request for German intervention, the Reichspakt was swift to act, and quickly surged soldiers to secure the teetering country.\n\nWhile there was some initial momentum for the Albanian socialist revolutionaries, they were unable to withstand the combined might of the Reichspakt and ultimately collapsed. While it is unlikely that the sentiments that led to the revolution have faded, it is clear that for now, any possibility of a socialist Albania has been crushed."
krg_ser_news.14.a: "It could only end this way."

krg_ser_news.15.t: "Serbian Revolution Spreads to Albania"
krg_ser_news.15.d: "Shocking news has emerged from Albaria, which has fallen to the Albanian socialist revolutionaries, led by Enver Hoxha. The revolutionaries have already established a provisional government, and declared that they are in control of the country. Serbia has been swift to recognize the new Albanian government, and warned against outside meddling.\n\nMany experts expected the Albanian government to ask for German assistance once the revolutionaries began gaining territory, but the government failed to secure German support before Hoxha's Serbian-supported revolutionaries were able to drive them out.\n\nAll eyes turn to Germany, as Europe collectively waits to see how the Reichspakt will respond to the development of another socialist state emerging in the Balkans."
krg_ser_news.15.a: "Are we seeing a resurgence of Syndicalism?"

krg_ser_news.16.t: "Albania Joins the Reichspakt"
krg_ser_news.16.d: "German and Albanian officials gathered today for an announcement that many international observers had anticipated - Albania's official entry into the Reichspakt. Most expected, following German support in crushing the socialist revolution, that joining the Reichspakt would soon follow the restoration of order.\n\nBoth countries presented the decision as mutually beneficial; Albania specifically highlighted the Reichspakt as a critical bulwark against radicalism and Syndicalist resurgence. However, most experts see it as a clear diplomatic coup for Germany, who now possesses a strong foothold in the Balkans - where they will most assuredly look to spread their influence further."
krg_ser_news.16.a: "An expected outcome."

krg_ser_news.17.t: "Danubia Intervenes in Serbia"
krg_ser_news.17.d: "Following the increased belligerence of Serbia throughout the Balkans, many observers were anticipating a reaction from the Danubian Federation, who had previously warned Serbia against perceived meddling in the region.\n\nToday, the Danubian Federation announced that they have authorized a military operation into Serbia to remove the sitting government, for the purposes of restoring order to Serbia, and the region. They highlighted that Serbia has become a destabilizing force, and their recent actions could not be tolerated.\n\nDanubian officials have insisted that they do not intend this to be a long-term occupation, and their soldiers will only remain in Serbia until peace has been restored, and a new government installed. Serbia has quickly rallied their forces against the invasion, but there are few who expect them to withstand the oncoming Danubian invasion."
krg_ser_news.17.a: "Playing with fire burns you eventually."

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_MILOVAN_DILAS_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJune 12th, 1911\nPodbišće, Kingdom of Montenegro\n§W--------------§!\nBorn to a war hero while war ripped the Balkans apart, Đilas was already a committed socialist in his youth; an expert in Marx and Monatte, and a member of the Socialist Workers Party during his studies at the University of Belgrade. The Restoration in 1936, and the establishment of the 6th of November Regime would change Đilas' life forever. Opposing it from the very start, Đilas spent over four years in a variety of Serbian jails, coming out a committed revolutionary. With the Republican-era socialist leadership largely executed by the mid 40s, it would fall to Đilas to reorganise the radical left. After the formation of his People's Socialist Party (which was promptly banned), Đilas spent his days evading the authorities and ajitating against the dictatorship in both Serbia and his native Montenegro.\n\nThe fracturing of the regime during the Spring of 1952 would prove to be his chance. Triggering the Montenegro Uprising, Đilas' socialists quickly turned their sights on Belgrade, ultimately succeeding in their Revolutionary mission and deposing the Dictatorship once and for all. Milovan now finds himself in charge of a nascent Socialist state, though one now far removed from the chaos of Syndicalism or the authoritarianism of Maximism. Instead, Đilas hopes to toe a liberatarian line, lifting of political repression, federalising Serbia and Montenegro and restoring Democracy. However, he'll have to fight his own party if the Đilasist vision is to succeed."
POLITICS_PETER_II_DEM_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nSeptember 6th, 1923\nBelgrade, Kingdom of Serbia\n§W--------------§!\nTo say Petar II Karađorđević had an eventful childhood would be an understatement. Whisked away to Canada in the wake of his father's assassination and the subsequent Serbian Revolution, Petar's early life revolved around tutelage from his uncle Pavle, instilling the cosmopolitian, yet revanchist ideals of the British Nobility at the time in the young prince. Another paradigm shift would occur in 1936, following Petar Živković's bloody coup. Restored to the throne, Petar was a puppet of the November 6th Dictatorship from the very beginning; excluded from national and military affairs with few powers of his own. Petar served as a unifying symbol of the reclaimed Serbian state, one much more palatable than his abrasive, incindieary father.\n\nBut all that has changed now. Drawing on his international ties for support, the young King stormed the National Assembly at the head of a legion of loyal soldiers, deposing the tyrannical November 6th Dictatorship. The Živković Constitution was torn apart, and Petar created his own one modelled off of the English Westminister System, though altered to fit Serbia's unique position. Petar's reformist mission isn't without opposition; the King has made himself an enemy of the same nationalist forces that ultimately excecuted his father in 1925, though for very different reasons. Under his encouraging hand, Serbia has entered into a second Golden age, though hopefully this one wont have the harrowing end of the first."

His liberal, anglophile sympathies are well known within the autocratic government, and his frequent prostÉtations about their conduct go completely ignored. The little influence he has is used on international affairs. The transition of the Belgrade Pact from its revanchist foundations following their victory over Bulgaria, to entrench the new political system, was largely Petar's doing. Marrying into the Greek royal family in 1944 only served to strengthen Serbia's bonds to the region. Nevertheless, the young king is barely respected by his own government, and is almost powerless to save a kingdom from a regime he believes is eating the nation alive.\n\nAlmost."

Now, the young King is utterly alone in the world, the figurehead of, to him at least, a pariah state without any ability to blunt its militarist anger. Deeply depressed at the state of his nation, Petar has wholly withdrawn from the regime that marches on in his name regardless of his protestations, and instead has turned to the bottle to cope with his percieved failures."
