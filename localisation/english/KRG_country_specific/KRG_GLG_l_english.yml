### Parties ###
GLG_authoritarian_socialist_party: "DSPA - Hallists"
GLG_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "Democratic Socialist Party of America - Hallists              §LClaiming to be a new party all together, it's no secret that the Democratic Socialist Party of America is the successor to the Socialist Party of America of the 30's. However, this party at least claims to be anti-militant and reformist, instead calling for a peaceful transfer of power back to a socialist system. The ambitious Gus Hall leads a smaller, radical current of the DSPA. Unlike Dennis' moderates Hall still believes in the March Revolution, or at least an idealised version of it.§!"
GLG_radical_socialist_party: "DSPA - Dennisists"
GLG_radical_socialist_party_long: "Democratic Socialist Party of America - Dennisists           §LClaiming to be a new party all together, it's no secret that the Democratic Socialist Party of America is the successor to the Socialist Party of America of the 30's. However, this party at least claims to be anti-militant and reformist, instead calling for a peaceful transfer of power back to a socialist system. Eugene Dennis leads the 'moderate' wing of the party, a contingent of actual Democratic Socialists and other libertarians who have moved on from the failure of the March Revolution.§!"
GLG_social_democrat_party: "Farmer-Labor"
GLG_social_democrat_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party                                            §LDominating Minnesota politics since 1918, the Farmer-Labor Party is a populist, progressive party and the final bastion of the old Farmer-Labor movement that arguably preceded Longism. They lack the nationwide appeal to challenge for the Presidency, and thus are forced to caucus with other national parties to pursue their goals.§!"
GLG_revolutionary_republican_party: "Young America"
GLG_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "Young America League                                           §LThe Great Lakes branch of the secretive Young America League, calling for the restoration of the United States. Many across the nation believe this group to be nothing more than a band of former Federalists, bitter with MacArthur's defeat.§!"
GLG_social_liberal_party: "Democrats"
GLG_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party                                                   §LThe continuation of the Democratic Party in the Great Lakes region, the Democratic Party believes in using a large social reconstruction policy to rebuild the Great Lakes region. The Democrats have generally shifted liberal since their northern reformation, having left the Conservative Garner-era and everything it represents behind. The Democrats are generally wary of continued Canadian meddling in the Great Lakes' affairs, advocating for a more independent, bilateral relationship with their benefactor.§!"
GLG_market_liberal_party: "GOP - Establishment"
GLG_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party - Establishment                           §LThe rebirth of the Grand Old Party of the former United States, the Republican Party follows the old, laissez faire ideology of the party of the 20's and 30's. Believing in using the free market to rebuild the Great Lakes while protecting and expanding the rights of its citizens, the Republicans also support the continued to support Canadian involvement in the Great Lakes' affairs, seeing the relationship as highly beneficial for the rebuilding states. Much of the party is fairly moderate on the 'Red Scare', seeing the red tentacles of revolution as having been chopped off for good.§!"
GLG_social_conservative_party: "Unionists"
GLG_social_conservative_party_long: "National Union Party                                         §LMany Americans living in the Great Lakes region care not for lofty liberal ideals and politics, but would rather be reunited with their brethren south of the border. For this reason, some populists in the Great Lakes have formed the Longist 'National Union Party', in lieu of the America First Party being illegal, and call for reunification with the AUS and the implementation of the Share the Wealth programme that made Long famous. Despite attempts to split the party, the Unionists§!"
GLG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "GOP - McCarthyites"
GLG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Republican Party - McCarthyites                              §LThe rebirth of the Grand Old Party of the former United States, the Republican Party follows the old, laissez faire ideology of the party of the 20's and 30's. Believing in using the free market to rebuild the Great Lakes while protecting and expanding the rights of its citizens, the Republicans also support the continued to support Canadian involvement in the Great Lakes' affairs, seeing the relationship as highly beneficial for the rebuilding states. With a continued 'Red Scare' about syndicalist insurrections still rife among the right of the Great Lakes, the young Federalist veteran Joseph McCarthy has become the face of radical anti-syndicalism within the Republicans.§!"
GLG_paternal_autocrat_party: "Reconstruction Govt"
GLG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "National Reconstruction Government                    §LFormed by High Commissioner Jacob Viner, the National Reconstruction Government has one goal: Rebuild. Given extrajudicial powers by the Canadian occupation, Viner's Administration has broadly succeeded in suppressing the revolutionary groups in the area, left over from the March Revolution, and have rebuilt the battered industry that filled the lands. Once Democracy returns to the Great Lakes, the National Reconstruction Government will hopefully never see the light of day again."
GLG_national_populist_party: "Vanguardists"
GLG_national_populist_party_long: "American Vanguard Party                                  §LOnce a member of the IWW, Harold Varney was outraged with the direction taken by the Socialist Party during the war, seeing the SPA as nothing more than a factionalised husk, wholly unable to lead a revolution and save America. Splitting and forming his American Vanguard Party, which he hoped would purify the socialist movements and bring a 'True Revolution' to America. Years on, though claiming to be socialists, the Vanguardists have adopted policies much more similar to far-right, national-populist movements.§!"


###Ideas###
GLG_questionable_legitimacy: "Questionable Legitimacy"
GLG_questionable_legitimacy_desc: "The States of the Great Lakes is meant to be a successor state of the United States along with New England and the Pacific states, but its founding is nowhere near as legitimate as the other two. It will take years to rebuild our institutions and regain the trust of the people."
GLG_canadian_dominated_industry: "Canadian Dominated Industry"
GLG_canadian_dominated_industry_desc: "After the Second American Civil War, worker owned factories were seized by the Canadian military. While some were returned to their owners and others were sold to American companies, many had to be sold to Canadian companies. As a result, the industry in the Great Lakes is dominated by Canadian and British corporations, an issue that must be remedied."
GLG_starting_from_scratch: "Starting from Scratch"
GLG_starting_from_scratch_desc: "Under the Canadian occupation, the Great Lakes region was only allowed a volunteer national guard. However, this is not enough to defend the nation. If the Great Lakes are to be independent, a proper military must be established."
GLG_socialist_resistance: "Socialist Resistance"
GLG_socialist_resistance_desc: "In the cities and factories, a spectre continues to haunt the Great Lakes region. The legacy of the Combined Syndicates still permeates the young nation, as well as a number of its disgruntled veterans. Efforts must be made to throw off the region's past, and reintegrate those who fought for a very different future."
GLG_new_englander_advisors: "New Englander Advisors"
GLG_new_englander_advisors_desc: "Advisors sent from New England, they are helping with everything from rooting out Syndicalist remnants to rebuilding industry and advising on relations with Canada."

krg_glg.1.d: "A change is in the air across the nation, as the people seem to have come to the conclusion that they are no longer the citizens of a defeated Combined Syndicates of America, but rather the future looking, fresh air breathing, progressive people of the Great Lakes.\n\nNo doubt this will lead to great things."

##National Focuses
GLG_finish_the_duluth_pocket: "Finish the Duluth Pocket"
GLG_finish_the_duluth_pocket_desc: "An element of diehard syndicalists still are present in the area around Duluth. While they have been successfully contained, we have not yet dropped the final hammer blow. Now the preparations are complete and the Military Police are ready to proceed with the final roundup."
GLG_invite_new_englander_advisors: "Invite New Englander Advisors"
GLG_invite_new_englander_advisors_desc: "As a fellow American successor state, and one that has managed to negotiate successfully with Canada in order to expand their independence after their founding during the Civil War, New England represents a potential wealth of advice and information about how to go about suppressing our Leftists and getting onto our own feet with regards to dealing with Canada."
GLG_reopen_the_mines: "Re-open the Mines"
GLG_reopen_the_mines_desc: "Without any workers actually working, we will be dependent on Canadian handouts forever. The first step to independence is economic, and we should look to reopen the mines as soon as possible."
GLG_opening_mackinac_bridge: "Opening Mackinac Bridge"
GLG_opening_mackinac_bridge_desc: "At present the only way to travel from the Upper Peninsula to Michigan proper and back is via ferry. This is a slow an inefficient process. The construction of the Mackinac Bridge has almost neared completion however, and we shall soon be able to officially open it, and create much freer movement in the Great Lakes area as a result."
GLG_expand_lake_michigan_ferry_services: "Expand Lake Michigan Ferry Services"
GLG_expand_lake_michigan_ferry_services_desc: "Lake Michigan lies across the heart of our territory, and even with the Bridge at Mackinac it is still several hours quicker to cross the lake directly. However for many, there has been a shortage of ferries, an inability to get tickets and reservation lists that are spanning weeks instead of hours. We should expand the service with an injection of government funding and some ex-war boats."
GLG_the_local_government_ordinance: "The Local Government Ordinance"
GLG_the_local_government_ordinance_desc: "We are never going to shake the suspicion that we are an illegitimate power-grab if we do not allow the people to govern themselves as they have been accustomed to in the past. As such, we are re-allowing government at local level, in the hope that this will permit continuing opening up."
GLG_general_amnesty_ordinance: "General Amnesty Ordinance"
GLG_general_amnesty_ordinance_desc: "With the failure of the Combined Syndicates of America, those who were diehard believers have mostly died. The people who remain to prosecute were usually swept up in the chaos of a civil war, and were fighting for their neighbourhoods, or serving as nurses because helping people is right, regardless of their beliefs. As such, a general amnesty should be called, which will free up resources for more important business."
GLG_continue_the_prosecutions: "Continue the Prosecutions"
GLG_continue_the_prosecutions_desc: "We will never stamp out the virulent ideas of the Syndicalists if we let them go free back to their communities with tales of how the vicious whites terrorised and jailed them and then let them go. We must continue the prosecutions and ensure that this dangerous subsection of society are where they belong - behind bars!"
GLG_local_police_establishment_ordinance: "Local Police Establishment Ordinance"
GLG_local_police_establishment_ordinance_desc: "The people who police themselves are more able to detect crime and manage their own affairs. We should therefore provide them the means and opportunity to take care of themselves, extending trust to the communities of this nation, and showing that we do not need Canadian Military Police to run our matters for us."
GLG_reestablish_civil_liberties: "Re-establish Civil Liberties"
GLG_reestablish_civil_liberties_desc: "With the General Amnesty in effect, there are no longer any need for the war-time special measures. The reintroduction of civil liberties to the country will provide a great relief to many, on all sides of the political spectrum."
GLG_the_internment_ordinance: "The Internment Ordinance"
GLG_the_internment_ordinance_desc: "With the continuing prosecution of Syndicalist war criminals, we will need to build special prison camps to manage them and keep them out of the general population. This can be performed under the wartime internment measures, though it will mean we may see a spike in attempts to liberate 'comrades' by those still outside them."
GLG_collaborate_with_the_dsa: "Collaborate with the DSPA"
GLG_collaborate_with_the_dsa_desc: "The Democratic Socialist Party of America is willing to work with the government. While their politics are radical, we believe their agenda is to attempt to capture the levers of power. However, their entry into government also means we capture some of their own systemic levers. It is possible with time, we will be able to de-fang them, policy by policy and water them down, whilst showing that we 'listen to our electorate'."
GLG_ending_the_mandate: "Ending the Mandate"
GLG_ending_the_mandate_desc: "With the progress we have made in the development of the country and the control of the political situation, the time is coming that we can officially take control of the government without reporting back to Ottawa as a dependency."
GLG_distribute_federal_funds: "Distribute Federal Funds"
GLG_distribute_federal_funds_desc: "There remains still some money in the National Treasury that can be dispersed through the states in order to facilitate additional development. By spending this money we will demonstrate we are not out to crush the common people of the Great Lakes as oppressors, but to show them that there are other options and modes of development both social and economic."
GLG_join_the_ottawa_protocols: "Apply to Join the Ottawa Protocols"
GLG_join_the_ottawa_protocols_desc: "The Ottawa Protocols were signed during the Civil War between the Pacific States, the Canadians and New England. Now we are an independent nation on our own two feet, we should apply to join as well, to show our resolve in the face of the Longists."

POLITICS_JACOB_VINER_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 3rd, 1892\nMontreal, Quebec, Dominion of Canada\n§W------------§!\nBorn in Canada to Romanian immigrants, Jacob Viner is the textbook definition of a technocrat. A professor of economics at the University of Chicago starting from 1916, Viner was part of a group of economists who advocated a fringe policy known as 'Keynsianism.' While not a hardliner, he did believe that the solution to economic depression was increased government spending. When the US did not heed the advice of the Keynsians, he returned to Canada just before the 2nd American Civil War.\n\nViner's expertise was heeded by the King government who used the Chicago school of economics' advice in order to grow the Canadian economy by huge amounts to wage the War of Reclamation. Now, Viner has been put in charge of the Great Lakes Administration, leading the civilian government in charge of the occupied American states. His clique of economists is aiming to pull off an economic miracle to get the Great Lakes Government up to the level needed."
