 AST_fragile_government: "A Fragile Government"
 AST_fragile_government_desc: "While our government has been able to stay in power over the past 9 years, our power and popularity has slipped greatly. Numerous strikes, industrial disputes put down and the pressures of wartime governance has resulted in this government no longer being seen as the favourite to lead. Many already see the writing on the wall and are already declaring the next election a miracle to win. And if we are going to survive the next election, we need that miracle soon."
 AST_industrial_disputes: "Industrial Disputes"
 AST_industrial_disputes_desc: "Many workers and industries are demanding the end of wartime protocols.

We must end these disputes or our economy will suffer further."
 AST_end_postwar_boom: "End of the Postwar Boom"
 AST_end_postwar_boom_desc: "Wartime production has been off the charts, increased trade from the Pacific States and Canada have helped our economy to grow to new heights.

New economic reforms will be necessary to ensure our nation adjusts to new postwar realities and to take advantage of these economic conditions."
 AST_Overextended_Forces: "Overextended Forces"
 AST_Overextended_Forces_desc: "With the war finally over we find ourselves in a situation similar to the Navy back in 1925, too large an armed force for too little a nation. With the demand for such a large military dropping in peacetime, and men demobilizing and returning to civilian life, we need to find a way to ensure a large fighting force is still able to operate with limited numbers of men. However, until this situation is sorted our militarys branches will suffer due to this.\n\n §ROur economy will struggle to maintain the armed forces indefinitely§"
 
 AST_pro_worker_policy: "Worker Relief"
 AST_pro_worker_policy_desc: "The government has embarked on a pro-worker policy, providing relief for the average worker in the form of a temporary reduction of income taxes and national insurance contributions."

 AST_new_immigration: "New Australasians"
 AST_new_immigration_desc: "The face of Australasia is changing, and our people are having to welcome new citizens among them who might have different cultural backgrounds than them."
 AST_pensions: "Soldiers' Pensions"
 AST_pensions_desc: "The current government budget is currently being stretched by the requirement to pay out military pensions due to the large proportion of men who served in the armed forces who have demobilised and have issued claims."
 AST_National_Housing_Commission: "National Housing Commission"
 AST_National_Housing_Commission_desc: "The shortage of housing in Australasia has necessitated the creation of a national housing commission to deal with the problem. They are taking up the task with vigor."
 AST_Temporary_camps: "Temporary Migrant Camps"
 AST_Temporary_camps_desc: "The numbers of incoming British and other migrants is such that the state is forced to provide them with temporary housing while new construction is underway."
 AST_convoys_for_immigrants: "Immigrant Convoys"
 AST_convoys_for_immigrants_desc: "The numbers of incomers are such that the government has organised a convoy system in order to try and manage the new population and to systematise their arrival."
 AST_Qantas_loans: "Qantas Loans"
 AST_Qantas_loans_desc: "The Australasian government is committed to building the flagship airline Qantas up, and part of that commitment includes disbursal of public money."
 AST_nationalised_banks: "Banks Nationalised"
 AST_nationalised_banks_desc: "Due to economic instability, the Australasian government has nationalised the banks in order to resolve liquidity issues."
 AST_permanant_fleet_reserve: "Permanent Fleet Reserve"
 AST_permanant_fleet_reserve_desc: "Despite the continued cost, Australasia has committed to maintaining a permanent reserve fleet."
 AST_fleet_for_pacific: "A Fleet for the Pacific"

 AST.0.t: "Social services referendum announcement"
 AST.0.d: "The government has just announced a proposed change to the Australasian constitution in order to have better control over the nation's social services. The proposal will include provisions, including, but not limited to, maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services, benefits to students and family allowances. Should this referendum be accepted it will see government support and funding for all those listed. All that's left is for the Australasian people to decide if they wish for this proposal to be accepted into the constitution."
 AST.0.a: "Bloody hell more voting?"

 AST.1.t: "Social services referendum"
 AST.1.d: "The Australasian people have voted, and the proposed change to the constitution for social services has passed! A huge win for labor and their proposal, it will now ensure all Australasians who need access to government support will and shall receive it."
 AST.1.a: "It passed!"

 AST.2.t: "High court overturns Bank Nationisation"
 AST.2.d: "The idea of nationalising these private banks was in hopes of having greater control over the nation's economy, alas it seems it was in vain. The high court has ruled that such an action by our government would be in breach the Australasian constitution on a number of sections and grounds. This failure will see the private banks continue to operate freely from our control and supervision leaving them to continue to act against our wishes."
 AST.2.a: "Bugger!"

 AST.3.t: "Post-War Demobilisation"
 AST.3.d: "At last, we find our nation victorious after years of bloodshed and sacrifice. Our small nation has once again given all it has to the allied cause, and unlike 30 years ago, we find ourselves triumphing over our foes. But with this new world and its peace, the need for a wartime military is no longer required. Already men of the various branches are growing anxious and impatient for their return to our shores and civilian life. Furthermore, with wartime production wrapping up and the economy returning to a peacetime one, the sheer cost of operating the current armed forces is a huge drain on our economy. \n\nBut even in peacetime, there's still a need for our forces in protecting our territories and interests from others. To ensure that our military maintains its fighting edge, but not at a huge cost to our nation, proposals are being drafted and put forward to the respective branches to prepare them for peacetime once more."
 AST.3.a: "Time to put our swords to ploughshares..."

 AST.4.t: "The Royal Australasian Army"
 AST.4.d: "As the men finally return to our shores, an old question dating before the war has arrived back also. The question on whether we keep using the militia model we have used since confederation, or finally establish a permanent army for the modern day. Many a long debate has been had over the benefits and disadvantages of either army model, but ultimately it boils down to a few major factors for either option.\n\nShould we stay with the current militia model, we retain the CMF (Citizen Militia Force) of reservists and reduce our standing army significantly back to the small peace-time army that it was prewar. However, a disadvantage of this system means that should war suddenly break out (as it has twice in the past 30 years), these forces are barred from serving overseas, requiring the formation of a volunteer expeditionary force to be able to be deployed away from our shores. While this severely limits the amount of manpower we can send overseas in war, the advantages lie in the cost of not having to have a large standing army constantly draining the economy. \n\nThen there is the proposed creation of a permanent regular army. This would entail retaining some of the men currently deployed as carrer soldiers in the army. Therefore by having a larger standing army during peacetime, we will have a larger force to quickly act and deploy, should a war or engagement occur overseas. Thus not requiring the creation of an expeditionary force and the time required to do so. Alas, the negatives of this option is the sheer cost of maintaining such a large standing army. New bases, buildings and services are needed to operate this, along with the continued running costs involved. This means this option is a costly long-term investment for our recovering economy to handle. \n\nShould either option be picked it will no doubt shape how our army continues to exist and operate in years to come. Now a few men must make the choice, and that will be..."
 AST.4.a: "As they say, if it ain't broke..."
 AST.4.b: "Out with the old, in with the Permanent!"

 AST.5.t: "The Royal Australasian Navy"
 AST.5.d: "Once again, it seems our nation is cursed with too many ships and too few men, just as we had back in 1925. While in the end, few of the old Royal Navy ships were maintained and eventually re-activated, now we are faced with modern ships that can still be used for years to come, without sufficient men to crew them. So two options have been presented to the Admiralty. Either establish a permanent reserve fleet and maintain the ships ready for another war, or strip them and send them to the scrappers for extra money off of their scrap sales."
 AST.5.a: "Im sure that ships metal is more useful elsewhere..."
 AST.5.b: "Australasia Rules the Waves!"

 AST.6.t: "The Royal Australasian Airforce"
 AST.6.d: "Unlike the prior services, the decision for the airforce had already been made before the war even ended. While the importance of airpower is not lost on our military, a simple fact has emerged following the chaos of the Second Weltkrieg. Jet planes are the future, old piston engine ones are not. \n\nAs our planes are flown or shipped back to our shores (many left behind due to the prohibitive cost), the older planes or ones deemed surplus are parked up in what some are dubbing "airplane graveyards". While useful parts like avionics and engines are retained by the airforce, the rest of the plane is cut up for parts or scrap. There are even some reports of civilians buying old fighters for scrap value, keeping them despite their uselessness!. Larger transport planes that are still operable are being sold off and converted for civilian uses in passenger and cargo services. Even coastal patrol flying boats are being used by airlines to link our nation together. \n\nWhile these warbirds have done their duty, the airforce is already shrinking in size and looking to modernise with newer jet craft for the modern age, leaving these older planes in the dust of obsolescence."
 AST.6.a: "Hand me that cutting torch could you?"

 AST.7.t: "Renegotiating the coalition"
 AST.7.d: "While the UAP-Country Coalition has won once again, this again has been formed out of necessity for the extra support. Thus it comes with negotiations to keep this coalition and the majority of the parliament in power. This time the leader of the Country Party, Earle Page, has requested for the party to receive another cabinet position in this new government in return for the continued alliance with the UAP. While many within the UAP aren't supportive of losing another seat in the cabinet, this request regardless will be accepted if it ensures our government stays in power."
 AST.7.a: "Art of the deal."

 AST_dip.0.t: "Civil War in Vietnam"
 AST_dip.0.d: "With a civil war breaking out in Japanese-aligned Vietnam, there are growing calls for our intervention in the conflict. Robert Menzies is advocating for sending soldiers to assist [VIE.getnamedef], seeing this as a first step to weaken the Japanese sphere."
 AST_dip.0.a: "The first domino to fall!"

###Leader Desc
POLITICS_HENRY_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nMarch 31st, 1900\nYork Cottage, England, United Kingdom\n§W--------------§!\nBorn to his mother Mary of Teck, later Queen Mary and the Duke of York, later King George V, the 4th of 6 children the couple had. His status as a royal family member would see him grow up in a privileged lifestyle. But in his early years, much like his brother Prince Albert, Henry suffered from many illnesses affecting his childhood years. With his father's ascendancy to the throne in 1910, Henry would be third in line to the crown, a title he would never attain. His academics outside of maths were not as bright as his siblings, however, he was extremely enthusiastic about sports especially cricket and football, making him known for his jovial attitude and characteristics.\n\nWith his lineage and studies, Henry would soon join the war effort in the First Weltkrieg, but in contrast to his brothers who had joined the Royal Navy, he would serve in the Army. Being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1919, later deployed in France seeing combat for the first time. However, as the front was continuing to deteriorate, and Entente forces retreating further and further back to Paris, his father and the rest of the Entente would pressure France into signing the Peace with Honor ending the First Weltkrieg.\n\nHenry would return home staying in his military post until the British Revolution in 1924, fleeing with the Royal Family to Canada. After adjusting to life in Canada, Henry would be posted as an aide-de-camp for his father in the Canadian Army, continuing serving the same role following his father's death and Edward's coronation. Then in 1939, Henry would be selected to replace the Australasian Governor-General Issac Issacs. He would be soon sent to Australasia taking up the role, reporting back to Edward in Ottawa. With the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, Henry would tour the nation to help improve morale amongst the population. But with the war over and won, Henry is looking to soon retire. With the strain of royal duties beginning to mount, along with tensions within Australasia mounting he is hoping for a few quiet years before retiring with his wife and family."

AST_Holland_desc: "§YSidney Holland§!\n§W--------------§!\n§YBorn:§!§L\nOctober 18th, 1893\nGreendale, New Zealand\n§!§W--------------§!\n§ Unlike his contemporary, Sidney Holland was not born into royalty and instead was born to a merchant and later Reform Party MP. Sidney was the youngest of a family of eight children. He enlisted in the ANZAC after the Weltkrieg broke out in 1915 first serving as a territorial. Holland would see combat on the Western Front, rising to the rank of second lieutenant. Later, during the Battle of Messines, he would experience extremely fierce combat. Due to the mutinies within the French Army, the British and Commonwealth forces had to fight on their own. After a rather decisive victory, he contracted an unknown illness and was sent home to New Zealand.\n\nOnce he was back in Christchurch, Holland was known for playing with New Zealand's national hockey team, but soon got into politics after the Melbourne Commune and the merging of New Zealand and Australia in 1925. Holland took his father's seat in politics after he was injured in an accident, soon joining the United Australasia Party.\n\nDuring the Second Weltkrieg Holland would take the role as Minister of Defence overseeing a successful transition to a wartime economy and the modernization of the Armed Forces. However, he had failed to ensure stable domestic policies and faced a falling out in Labour relations. In the years following, however, the UAP government has been in a state of disarray culminating in the resignation of Stanley Bruce. Holland soon took up his position as Prime Minister, with hopes to lead Australasia into a golden era.§!"

AST_the_1948_election_desc: "After 3 years so much has changed for the Confederation. With the Second Weltkrieg finally over, Australasia has emerged victorious. But in this new Cold War we must be ready for what may come in this new world. Will the UAP-Country coalition of the past 12 years be able to win what is being described as a 'unwinnable' election? Or will the emerging Labor Party for the first time since the coup attempt, be able to topple the UAP-Country coalition and win the election? The Australasian people will decide."
 AST_the_light_on_the_hill_desc: "Victory! The Labor Party has been elected to power finally! The party of the working man will strive to ensure workers rights everywhere! The Australasian people have voted and we shall lead this nation for the betterment of its people everywhere."
 AST_an_unwinnable_election_desc: "In spite of what many were deeming an 'unwinnable' election, the UAP-Country coalition has emerged victorious! The Australasian people have voted, and so we must lead Australasia to a golden age of prosperity for all."
 AST_begin_demobilisation_desc: "With the Syndicalist menace gone to hell, the home isles liberated and the Second Weltkrieg over we can begin the demobilisation of our military. The men can finally return to their valleys and their farms."
 AST_new_australasians_desc: "Following the British revolution many refugees made their way to Australia and New Zealand to seek a better life away from the revolution. Now with the Second Weltkrieg over we are facing another wave of refugees, not just from Britain but all of Europe too. With many tired of the countless conflicts in recent years they seek our nation for a new home and work."
 AST_open_up_places_for_others_desc: "For years Australasian immigrant policy has focused almost exclusively on British citizens. However in this new world and the aftermath of the Second Weltkrieg, we must accept the fact that many no longer see their home nations as their home. Therefore we must open up Australasia for other Europeans to make their home."
 AST_expansion_of_british_immigration_desc: "With an increase of British citizens wishing to leave the home isles, we must expand our immigration system to allow an easier path for British residents to move to our land. While this does mean people from other nations wishing to immigrate will be pushed aside in favour of British citizens, it still means we will gain citizens with more experienced backgrounds."
 AST_10_pound_poms_desc: "With the invasion and capitulation of the Union of Britain many of its citizens are now out of work and home. Many more of its citizens feeling no loyalty to the new British government are subsequently seeking to migrate elsewhere for a new life. This has resulted in an influx of British citizens migrating to our shores, with Australasians dubbing these new settlers "10 Pound Poms" over the migration cost of 10 pounds to enter."
 AST_whats_best_for_business_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg is over. Therefore it's time for the government to transition from that of a wartime to a peacetime government. We must ensure that this economic transition from wartime to civilian industry ensures that businesses still profit and that the economy continues to grow."
 AST_renegotiating_the_coalition_desc: "After securing another victory we must again renegotiate the coalition to ensure the parties stability. Of course this means we will have to make concessions to the Country Party to ensure their loyalty. However if it ensures our government stays in power, so be it."
 AST_use_old_troop_transports_desc: "To help with the flow of immigrants to our shores we can convert old surplus troop transports to transport them here. Once any useful military hardware is removed and retrofitted for civilian use, these ships will greatly assist shipping companies with getting migrants to our shores safely."
 AST_whats_best_for_the_country_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg is over. Therefore it's time for the government to transition from that of a wartime to a peacetime government. We must now turn our attention towards the betterment of the country and its peoples in this new age."
 AST_trans_australasia_airways_desc: "For decades crossing Australia has been a long and perilous task. Even with the invention of the train and automobile, it still takes days, if not weeks to cross the continent. However, with the invention of the aeroplane and developments of air travel in the last decade means that the use of planes as a form of travel can be exploited. The government has proposed the creation of an airline to cross Australia domestically and significantly reducing travel times between cities and towns, greatly opening up this vast land."
 AST_nationalize_failing_factories_desc: "Despite various government schemes and subsidies some privately owned industries are failing and face closure. We must ensure this does not continue and cause mass unemployment like that of the depressions. So the government will nationalise these factories to ensure that workers still have jobs no matter what."
 AST_establish_the_commonwealth_housing_commission_desc: "Many Australasians find it hard to be able to purchase or own a home. And with the influx of returning soldiers and refugees the demand is at an all time high. Therefore it has been proposed to establish a confederation housing commission, where states can apply for government loans to create new public housing for people to live in."
 AST_referendum_on_social_services_desc: "A referendum has been put forward to see if the federal government should have expanded powers to legislate social services. This would mean an amendment to the constitution but would ensure the allowance of health services to all citizens of the confederation."
 AST_take_over_collection_of_income_tax_desc: "Under the current tax system each state is incharge of collecting taxes from its citizens. Subsequently this is a bureaucratic nightmare for the federal organising all the various states taxes. Therefore it has been proposed that the federal government steps in and takes control over collecting income taxes from the states under a centralised scheme."
 AST_tackle_large_monopolies_desc: "Throughout the nation various companies and firms hold monopolies over jobs, services and transport. To combat these firms and ensure a fairness of business throughout the confederation we must deal with these monopolies head on."
 AST_a_national_health_service_desc: "For years hospitals and health services have been provided by states and private charities with various amounts of funding. In an effort to ensure the same level of health care throughout the nation, a National Health Service has been proposed to deal with this issue."
 AST_begin_the_snowy_mountains_scheme_desc: "For years the river that flows through the Snowy Mountains has had numerous proposals to modify and dam it for water supply and agricultural purposes. However a third use for the river has been brought up, for the river to be used in the production of electricity. Designs for this scheme have been drafted and put forward. Estimates say that such a task will take years and thousands of workers needed to complete but would ensure water security and a large flow of electricity for years to come. All that's waiting now is for us to give it the greenlight to begin."
 AST_establish_the_commonweath_employment_service_desc: "In recent years with a shortage of labour from both depression and war has resulted in key industries suffering from lower production and output. Therefore we shall establish an employment service to identify these areas of labour shortages and help provide labour. It also shall help citizens on welfare by providing "work tests", to assess the willingness and ability of a welfare recipient to work."
 AST_the_dairy_industry_fund_desc: "Throughout Australasia the dairy industry is a major industry and export. However it currently operates without any set export price, meaning exporters are exploiting this to get cheaper dairy products and sell them for higher prices. To combat this we will establish a dairy industry fund that will ensure a set export price that is fair to the industry and farmers."
 AST_open_temporary_camps_desc: "While our changes to the immigration system have expanded the amount of people immigrating to our nation, we did not however expect the sheer amounts seeking our shores. So in order to deal with this hopefully temporary mass immigration we will use empty army barracks for these migrants to live in while we sort out work and homes for them."
 AST_limit_the_powers_of_the_ccca_desc: "The Confederation Court of Conciliation and Arbitration (CCCA) deals and settles with any industrial disputes. However the powers of this course in recent years has been exploited by the government against the workers of Australasia. As the labor party we must limit this court's powers to be more friendly towards industries instead of being harsh."
 AST_lower_requirements_for_means_test_scholarships_desc: "The current system for gaining scholarships is no longer adequate for today's schooling, thus many students who should be able to attend a University cannot due to lack of funds. Therefore lowering requirements for scholarships should help see a steady increase in students attending Universities and helping this nation."
 AST_nationalise_the_banks_desc: "Currently the main banks in Australasia have far too much power over our citizens and the economy. So in order to combat this monopoly of money it has been proposed we nationalise the banks to ensure a fair banking system for the nation."
 AST_favour_australasian_investors_desc: "To help boost the economy we should favour Australasian investors in order to help the economy. By favouring Australasian investors should ensure that many business don't close or are sold to foriegn companies, subsequently helping the growth of the economy."
 AST_establish_soldiers_pensions_desc: "With the troops beginning to return to their homes, many wish to retire or are unable to work due to injuries gained from the war. Therefore the government will establish a soldier pension for former members of the armed forces to ensure they can live normal lives."
 AST_attract_foreign_investors_desc: "In an effort to boost our economy we should attract foriegn investment to help our economy. With a boost in foriegn currency, it should help ensure the economy continues to grow."
 AST_create_the_business_transition_fund_desc: "An economy cant just change from a wartime to peacetime economy overnight. So with the creation of the Business transition fund the government will assist industries to convert back to peacetime, ensuring a smooth transition."
 AST_increase_tariffs_desc: "With nations all around the world rebuilding and expanding, so does the demand for raw materials. Thanks to our nation's vast wealth in these materials we can make use of this increase in demand and export by putting tariffs on certain materials. While this may annoy other nations it does mean more money goes into our nation's coffers."
 AST_continue_the_crackdown_on_unions_desc: "For years our party has been pursuing radical unions and limiting the power and roles they have over our economy. Even though the Syndicalists are defeated doesn't mean an end to this crackdown on unions."
 AST_subsidize_retraining_desc: "With many veterans coming back being away from home for so long, many can't simply go back to their old jobs. So we will look to subsidise a retraining program to ensure that these men can go back to work as if they had never left."
 AST_expand_the_powers_of_the_ccca_desc: "During many industrial disputes and strikes the Confederation Court of Conciliation and Arbitration (CCCA) has been our best tool for dealing with these issues. Therefore to help our government deal with any future industrial issues we should expand the power of the CCCA which should ensure a strong hold over industries."
 AST_begin_to_breakup_the_big_unions_desc: "During our past years in government a major thorn in the side the entire time has been the big unions. Multiple times they have striked and demanded change from the government, crippling our industrial and economic output. So to finally remove this pesky thorn it's time to begin breaking up these Unions."
 AST_commonwealth_scholarship_scheme_desc: "By creating a confederation scholarship scheme we will see the expansion of scholarships to universities throughout the confederation. Which should see student numbers boosted aiding in research and the future of this nation."
 AST_end_rationing_desc: "Since the beginning of the war our citizens have had to endure a rationing system for all goods. But with the war over and peace time production picking back up, there is no longer a need for this system to stay in place."
 AST_increase_funds_for_highways_desc: "Currently the string of highways and roads that connects the Confederation is in a sorry state. Due to a lack of funding, roads not paved or even existing is a pain for our logistics and citizens. Therefore it's time we increase the funds for the highways to bring them into the modern day and help us for years to come."
 AST_expand_the_csiro_desc: "The Confederation Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is a government agency that is in charge of scientific research in the Confederation. Currently the organisation is limited by funding and facilities, thus development and research is slow. If we fund an expansion of this branch it will help with technological development and revolutionary research for years to come."
 AST_create_a_federal_public_works_service_desc: "Currently public works are undertaken and organised at a state level. However, in an effort to help with the construction of key infrastructure such as railroads, power stations, highways and military sites, the creation of a Federal Public Works Service has been proposed. It would put civilians to work directly for government projects and provide jobs and homes for the workers while working on any projects set out by the government."
 AST_provide_loans_to_qantas_desc: "Our national air carrier the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (QANTAS), is in charge of most flights domestically and internationally for Australasia. Therefore  we should provide loans to the company to ensure its growth and expansions of service throughout Australasia and the world."
 AST_finish_electrification_desc: "A major project during the past decades has been the electrification of the nation. However while a majority of the nation is now connected to the national grid, many regions and towns are not. So to finally bring the nation into the modern age we shall finally finish the electrification of the nation."
 AST_tender_new_defence_contracts_desc: "While the war is over and won we can't simply let the military sit idle and grow obsolete in this Cold War. So we must tender out new defence contracts to military firms to ensure that our military industry stays up to date along with our military as well."
 AST_expand_anu_desc: "The Australasian National University is the largest university in the Confederation and provides us with important research and development. So to increase these developments and research we shall expand the university."
 AST_establish_a_permanant_fleet_reserve_desc: "With the war over and many men wishing to retire from the military, maintaining such a large active fleet with so few men is becoming a costly task. Therefore it has been proposed that ships deemed essential still be in active service, while any deemed not to be essential are put in a reserve fleet that can be made ready for combat at a moments notice."
 AST_the_growth_of_the_raaf_desc: "While the First Weltkrieg showed the emergence of air power in war, the Second Weltkrieg has shown how vital this branch is in any conflict. So as we look to enter the jet age the RAAF must be modernised to stay an effective force in this new age."
 AST_a_modern_army_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg has seen the emergence of many new technologies and advancements. From the importance of the tank, mass motorization, communication systems and first aid practises, the army must evolve to this new school of thought in the modern age."
 AST_the_return_of_our_battleships_desc: "During the war the age of our ships began to show. With some being pre-First Weltkrieg vintage and hand-me-downs from the former British Asia Squadron of the Royal Navy, completely lack modern equipment such as effective AA or RADAR which have proven essential in modern naval warfare. For this reason a few of our most (relatively speaking) modern battleships were sent to Canadian and New England dockyards to be retrofitted and modernised to become the centrepieces of the navy. With the refits finally over the ships are ready to return to active service."
 AST_expand_undersea_warfare_desc: "With the rise of Japanese naval dominance in the Pacific it's becoming clear we will not be able to catch up in the numbers of capital ships they operate. Therefore it has been proposed to expand our undersea warfare capabilities. So instead of battling head on, we will instead harass enemy convoys and logistics from the safety of the deep."
 AST_obtain_another_carrier_desc: "With the age of the battleship coming to an end and the need to counter Japanese dominance in the Pacific, the need for another carrier is becoming more clear. Therefore we shall tender for a completely new carrier to be built in Canada/New England to help boost our fleet."
 AST_fund_new_shipyards_desc: "With a large navy comes the need for large repair and construction facilities. However most of our major shipyards are too small for larger ships, and have to be sent to Canada or New England to be repaired or built. This reliance on foreign dockyards must end, as if we are cut from our allies we need to be able to keep our navy in fighting shape. So it's time to fund the building of new shipyards for our fleet to use."
 AST_develop_new_escorts_desc: "With the arrival of a new modern aircraft carrier, it needs modern escorts. Currently however our navy has few escorts of modern design, with most being interwar vintage, hopeless in defending a capital ship from modern threats. Therefore we must develop and build modern escorts for a modern navy."
 AST_fortress_rabaul_desc: "With our "seizing" of GEA South Pacific holdings we received a nice parting gift from the Germans, the port of Rabaul. A natural large harbour which is perfect for any operations into the Pacific by our naval forces. The Germans had developed the harbour little along with a few defences, in its current state it could easily be invaded by enemy forces. So we must begin a project to turn this port into a fortress, so that no enemy shall ever take it from us."
 AST_transition_to_the_cac_platypus_desc: "The recently developed CAC Platypus is a modern naval aircraft that takes the lessons learnt from the recent war and puts it all together. The new plane will be able to act as a new maritime patrol, torpedo, and dive bomber, removing the need for separate types of maritime aircraft needed to protect our ships and shores."
 AST_new_radar_sets_desc: "Radar in the past few years has come a long way. From only being able to detect forces far away, unable to tell what they are, to being able to tell their exact position, size, shape and direction. So to keep up with this rapid development we must begin replacing our older radar sets with modern ones to future-proof our detection capabilities."
 AST_a_fleet_for_the_pacific_desc: "With our fleet upgraded and modernised it's time for our navy to become a Pacific orientated one. We now possess enough modern capital ships and a large enough fleet to challenge that of our allies and rivals. The Royal Australasian Navy shall rule the Pacific's waves."
 AST_license_new_england_submarines_desc: "With our focus now fixed on underseas warfare, it makes sense that we have submarines. However our current submarines, adpated from Canadian designs, are not designed for the war in the Pacific. Therefore we should approach the New England, who already have experience in building submarines designed for Pacific operations, and seek to licence their designs for our shipyards to produce."
 AST_develop_new_torpedoes_desc: "Torpedos are no longer just a long tube with a motor and explosives anymore. With such developments as proximity, magnetic and movement fuses to the recent experimental self-guiding torpedoes, we must keep up with this rapid pace of development to maintain a fighting edge. So in cooperation with our partners we shall develop modern torpedoes of our own keeping our navy's torpedo capabilities deadly."
 AST_the_nuclear_option_desc: "Fellow Accord member New England has recently launched their revolutionary new submarine NENS Nautilus. It's nuclear-powered propulsion enables the submarine to have virtually unlimited range, only needing to surface for oxygen and supplies. Such a design would be perfect for submarine operations in the Pacific, enabling us to commit actions anywhere without fear of running out of fuel. We should approach the New England navy and see if we can purchase the designs so we may benefit from this game changing ship."
 AST_expand_hmas_stirling_desc: "Currently our naval stations are primarily focused on the Pacific theatre, leaving our Western Shores without a sufficient naval base to operate from in the Indian Ocean. To ensure that our supply lines from Europe are secure from foriegn naval powers, we should begin the establishment of HMAS Stirling on the West Coast to better support a large fleet in the Indian Ocean."
 AST_cac_eagle_desc: "While our main frontline fighter the CAC Kangaroo is a adequate fighter, it's fast becoming outdated in the jet race with the development of better more agile jet fighters. However CAC has recently obtained a licence for the NAA Sabre jet from the PSA to produce from scratch here in Australasia. Requiring a slight redesign to mount the more powerful and locally produced Rolls-Royce Avon engine, and various other changes, this jet will be the main fighter for the RAAF for years to come."
 AST_fund_raaf_woomera_desc: "In this new age of cruise missiles, jets and rockets testing for such technologies has been a challenge for many members of the Accord, either from lack of space or suitable infrastructure. But here in Australasia we are gifted with vast expanses of empty barren land in the outback. Thus plans have been put forward to establish a testing facility and range in the South Australian outback where we can test these new weapons and ideas safely with suitable infrastructure to operate from."
 AST_northern_early_warning_positions_desc: "There are fears that a Northern airborne attacker could easily attack the Northern coast of Australia without being detected in time for us to intercept them. Therefore it has been proposed we acquire new long range RADAR equipment from our allies and set up positions along the Northern coast, so we may have a chance of detecting any foes before they reach our shores."
 AST_moderise_and_expand_our_airfield_desc: "The current state of many of our air bases in Australasia is no longer adequate for the new jet age. Many still are just grass airstrips, lacking any shelters or facilities for aircraft, rendering them useless for a modern air force. To keep up with the times, we must go on a modernisation and expansion project to ensure the future-proofing of these air bases for use."
 AST_testing_site_of_the_accord_desc: "With RAAF Woomera established we may now begin testing and developing new technologies for our nation. But with this new site being unique in its sheer size and possible uses, we should open the site up to all Accord members to be able to test on, and subsequently co-operate in R&D of new technologies."
 AST_fund_the_expansion_of_cac_desc: "Our largest native aircraft manufacturer, Confederation Aircraft Corporation (commonly referred to as CAC), is the primary producer of aircraft in our nation. Therefore it makes sense to fund the expansion of their factory in Melbourne to increase aircraft production for both civil and military contracts."
 AST_license_boeing_bombers_desc: "For years now most aircraft produced in the government aircraft factories (GAF) have been licensed from Canadian designs. But in the new age of jets and nuclear warfare, our air force must have its own counter to threats from foreign powers. Thankfully the Boeing company in PSA is willing to license the designs for their bombers so we may produce them here and have our own counter to any foriegn power."
 AST_develop_strike_fighters_desc: "An idea of a fighter's main role is that of maintaining aerial superiority and being able to conduct CAS operations have been thought up for years, but never properly utilised. However with recent technological developments such an idea can be brought to fruition and would provide a key role for modern air forces."
 AST_a_new_permanant_force_desc: "While our army has fought bravely in the last war the cessation of hostilities means it must now revert to its peacetime status. Already divisions are being disbanded and soldiers are returning to their civilian lives. However, it would be foolish of us to revert to the condition the army was in pre-1940, with the looming Kalterkrieg and potential threats close to home. Therefore we must ensure that no matter what the future brings we'll have an army that's ready to tackle whatever threats or conflicts that arise."
 AST_continue_combined_arms_experiments_desc: "Before and during the Second Weltkrieg the army had been experimenting with combined arms strategies and techniques. But at this stage it has all been very experimental with the army still not adopting such strategies. However the Second Weltkrieg has shown the power of combined arms warfare in defeating foes, therefore in this new age we should look to continue with these experiments and perhaps even implement them into the army's strategies."
 AST_focus_on_shock_and_awe_desc: "The power of artillery has been proven since the beginning of the First Weltkrieg in being an effective strategy to counter massed enemy forces. Therefore we should focus our efforts on the 'shock and awe' strategy with massed artillery barrages supporting troops when attacking enemy forces."
 AST_more_native_vehicle_factories_desc: "Currently the domestic automotive industry in Australasia is still in its infancy. Most factories only assembling cars that have been built and shipped from overseas. To end this reliance on foriegn imports we shall expand our domestic industry so we may make vehicles from scratch here in Australasia."
 AST_expand_the_lithgow_works_desc: "The Lithgow works began production of the venerable Lee Enfield No 3 in 1912. Since then it has been our nation's primary producer of small arms and a great strategic asset to the Entente and now the Accord. But while the war maybe over and wartime production wraps up, the factory should be modernised and retrofitted with new toolings for modern arms and modern production methods."
 AST_found_the_marine_regiment_desc: "During the landings in Ireland and the UK the world saw the importance in amphibious landings of marines by the Royal marines. And in our theatre of the world there is high importance in having a force that can be quickly deployed amphibiously onto islands and targets. As such a proposal has been put forward to establish our own marine regiment with help from Canadian advisors."
 AST_expand_the_amoured_brigades_desc: "With the expansion of combined arms experiments, it also expands the need for more armour to experiment with. Currently the army's armoured brigades are under-equipped, mostly with outdated tanks. To continue these experiments and provide an adequate fighting force we should aquire more modern tanks to continue these exercises."
 AST_buy_amphibious_tanks_desc: "The naval invasions of Ireland and the UoB have shown that men don't have to land without any armoured support. Thanks to inventions such as Amtracks and Duplex Drive tanks, means that troops have an extra punch when landing on enemy shores. With the creation of the marine regiment it makes sense to purchase surplus amphibious tanks so that our troops may never experience another Gallipoli."
 AST_study_european_warefare_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg in mainland Europe saw the rise and dominance of many new technologies and strategies. In an effort to learn from both mistakes and successes each side had during the conflict, studies into this period need to begin. If all goes well, maybe we will even develop tactics to rival that of the German High Command!"
 AST_adopt_a_main_battle_tank_desc: "Towards the end of the war nations began adopting a new type of tank for the frontline. This tank known as a 'Main Battle Tank', or MBT for short, is able to perform the roles of scouting, engaging infantry and enemy tanks all while having decent armour protection and firepower. If we are to have a modern tank force we too should adopt this tank type."
 AST_expand_army_logisitics_desc: "While the recent mechanisation efforts have progressed well, it's also increased the need for more logistics to the troops. Therefore we should expand our army's logistics corps to meet this increase in demand for a modern military."
 AST_mechanise_the_infantry_brigades_desc: "Currently the logistics for our infantry brigades is reliant on a mixture of requisitioned civilian vehicles and underpowered trucks. To bring our infantry divisions into the modern era we should look to upgrade the brigades with more powerful modern trucks, giving our infantry access to fast and secure logistics."
 AST_stick_with_light_armour_desc: "While other powers equip themselves with larger and heavier tanks, we should stick to lighter armour. Our vast range of terrain from deserts to jungles means that these heavier tanks would struggle due to our varying terrain. So while other nations race to build the biggest tank with with the biggest guns, we'll stick to light tanks so we may exploit any terrain they are placed in."
 AST_combined_jungle_warfare_desc: "With any future conflict, we may be dragged into, likely in our backyard, we should look into training our troops in the lessons of jungle warfare. Lessons such as close-quarters combat, specialised jungle equipment, and how to manoeuvre through the dense jungle foliage all need to be learnt. Thus we'll open up a jungle warfare school for our troops and bring in experts in this field of combat from across the Accord, so we'll be ready to deal with any rumbles in the jungle."
 AST_advanced_firepower_desc: "Currently the army's artillery stock is adequate for supporting an army during the Weltkrieg. But in this new age of high calibre artillery and rockets we must look at these new forms of firepower and adapt to them to truly unlock the potential of artillery barrages."
 AST_antitank_guns_desc: "The Second American Civil war and warfare in Europe recently has highlighted the importance of having specialty artillery pieces to counter mass armoured attacks. So to be able to counter an armoured force upon our troops we should invest in the purchase and equipping of anti-tank guns."
 AST_jungle_artillery_tactics_desc: "Our current strategies and equipment for jungle artillery are hopelessly outdated and under equipped. It makes sense with our recent persual of modern artillery systems that we develop a modern jungle artillery platform and develop tactics for its use in jungle operations."
 AST_rocket_artillery_battalions_desc: "With the development of rockets and missiles during the war we should look to the adoption of rocket artillery battalions. While nowhere near as accurate as traditional artillery, its power comes from the sheer amount of rockets bombarding an area greatly affecting the enemies position and morale."
 AST_study_japanese_tactics_desc: "It's no secret that our main rival in the Pacific is the Empire of Japan. Their expansionist policies, the annexation of most of the former GEA, and supporting the Indonesian revolution, hold a dagger to our Northern shores and territories. While we may have the support of the Accord on our side, it will take time for our allies' troops and ships to come to our aid in case of conflict. Thus, we should study the recent Eastern Seas War between Germany and Japan and learn as much as possible about Japanese military tactics, equipment, and capabilities. So in case of conflict with them, we'll be ready for when they come South."
 AST_the_pearl_of_the_pacific_desc: "With the fall of GEA and most of the Pacific to the Japanese and 'independence' movements, Australasia has stood firm through the chaos and emerged as a beacon of stability and prosperity in the Pacific. But if we want to stay that way we must look beyond our shores to keep our interests and growth stable."
 AST_stick_to_our_roots_desc: "With the British Isles retaken and the chaos in America calming we can resume our trade to our traditional markets, ensuring that Australasian goods will always be in demand to our loyal allies and partners."
 AST_diversify_trade_partners_desc: "For years we have been far too reliant on Entente and traditional European trading partners. But the revolution in Britain and the Second Weltkrieg have shown how prone our economy is to suffering thanks to these ties to our traditional partners. Therefore we should look to diversify our trading partners to ensure that our economy is not tied to one group of nations alone." 
 AST_looking_north_desc: "It would be foolish to ignore the rise of the Japanese Empire to our North. In recent years we have seen them emerge to fill the void that Germany and the former United States have left in the Pacific, becoming a hegemon over nations in China, South East Asia, and the Pacific. But their rise has caused an uptick in rebel activity all over the Pacific against the Japanese occupiers and puppet governments. We should look to exploit this and begin plans to ensure our interests across these regions."
 AST_make_contact_with_rebel_groups_desc: "Throughout South East Asia and the Pacific, former European colonies have been annexed by the Japanese or declared 'independence' from their former colonial masters. However in reality in most places they have traded one overlord for another, resulting in many citizens of these nations openly opposing their governments. We should make use of this opportunity and begin making contacts with these groups, and begin funding and teaching them guerrilla tactics to use against their governments. This should help to secure our interests and promises of a pro-Australasian Pacific."
 AST_diplomatic_mission_to_nanjing_desc: "China in recent years has been a chaotic mess of warlords, infighting, and invasions. While this region has not affected us in any significant way, the emergence of the Southern Guangzhou Government appears to be a more stable democratic nation that we could open relations and trade with. So a diplomatic mission to their government has been put forward to open diplomatic and trading links with this new nation from which both nations may benefit."
 AST_aid_mission_to_britain_desc: "While the British isles have been retaken, the chaos and destruction brought on by the war have left the isles in a sorry state. In order to help our fellow Entente member we should look to send an aid mission to help aid in the reconstruction of the isles."
 AST_state_visit_to_sacramento_desc: "Australasia and the United States of America for years have had a special relationship, both being former British colonies and trade partners.
