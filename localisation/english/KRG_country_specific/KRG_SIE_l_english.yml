 krg_sie.1.d: "The Sierra Leonese people have been celebrating in the streets of Freetown this evening after the Prime Minister officially announced the country's independence! A century of colonial rule has come to an end today as the Canadian government assented to the Sierra Leonese people's demand to govern themselves. [CAN.GetLeader] complimented Sierra Leone on their commitment to the Entente during the Weltkreig and on how far they have come as a nation. The leaders of most Accord nations have sent similar offers of support and congratulations. It is expected that Sierra Leone will formally join The Accord and possibly NATO shortly."
