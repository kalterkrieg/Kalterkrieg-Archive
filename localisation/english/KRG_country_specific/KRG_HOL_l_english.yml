#Ideas
HOL_Reconstruction: "De Reconstructie van Nederland"
HOL_Reconstruction_desc: "The Reconstruction of the Netherlands (De Reconstructie van Nederland) is the daunting task of the current Romme government. When the French left, millions of guldens in infrastructure were demolished and destroyed by the fleeing Federal Army. The French occupation and the subsequent bombing of many Dutch cities have also left an enormous shortage of housing for those who survived the bloodiest conflict of the 20th century. The destruction of so many buildings, highways, rails and churches have left us with the simple but gigantic task of cleaning up the mess of war. Major public programs have already been planned by Romme and the ministry of finance, with the modernisation of the Dutch economy and state and new theories in urban planning in the back of their minds."
HOL_Divided_Liberation: "The Divided Liberation"
HOL_Divided_Liberation_desc: "The Liberation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands did not go with a swift stroke of the German army, but in two major phases: the liberation of the northern provinces in '44 and the later liberation of the southern provinces in '45. The Rhine and the Maas made complete liberation in 1944 impossible for the German forces, as the French forces kept control of the bridges and the major highways between the north and the south of the Netherlands. This simple fact has led to the suffering of many civilians in the south, as the winter prior to the April liberation and Operation Münzenbaum would be one of the worst winters the Netherlands experienced in decades: the rationing of supplies and the increasingly hostile occupation of French forces led to many Brabanders, Limburgers and Zeelanders being forced to seek food in the rural countryside. Golden rings and pearl strings were traded away for a couple of eggs or a loaf of bread, wooden fences were cut down and used for fuel and molten snow was used as hydration for most. The eventual liberation of the south of the Netherlands brought an end to the horror of famine, as Germany quickly helped the Netherlands supply its starving southern population. \n\nThe effects of the later liberation of the south are still felt today, as the people of the south remember the days of the hunger winter as one of inhumane brutality, brought by the pale horse and its owner, war."
HOL_German_Presence: "German Presence"
HOL_German_Presence_desc: "When the first German soldiers and conscripts reached the cities of the Netherlands, they were met with celebration, cheers and a grateful population that had suffered under the effects of war and totalism. Luxury products from the German colonies, such as chocolate and bananas, were gifted to the young Dutch children and more than one German conscript would have fun with an unmarried Dutch girl. With the eventual end of the war, many German conscripts abandoned Germany for the Netherlands, starting a new life with the people they met in the friendly neighbouring nation. Personal preference would, however, not be the only reason for some German soldiers to stay in the Netherlands. \n\nThe end of the Second Weltkrieg brought about a new order in Europe, freeing the people from the former tyranny of syndicalism and totalism. However, the war wasn't even at an end or old rivalries would be replaced by even older rivalries: the French liberation would lead to the division of the old French Commune between the Reichspakt and the Accord, leaving Europe, once again, divided. The Netherlands quickly became a German priority with this new cold war, as the Dutch were known for their neutrality favouring both Germany and Britain. While anti-British and -French sentiment were quite high among the Dutch in the years after the liberation, many in the German government worried the possibility of a renewing of Dutch neutrality leading to an eventual increase in pro-Accord opinion. With the later conference of Arnhem, the Netherlands would be forced to accept a continued German presence in the provinces of Groningen and Overijsel, granting the Germans the opportunity to intervene in case of an emergency. \n\n§RIf the Netherlands experience major instability, Germany will likely respond and intervene in Dutch affairs with force.§!"
HOL_Lost_Indonesia: "The Lost Indonesian Jewel"
HOL_Lost_Indonesia_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg was still consuming Europe when we were forced to recognize the independence of the Dutch East Indies, the crown jewel of the Dutch Empire. The Japanese-backed revolution in the East Indies ousted the Dutch colonial leadership in 1941, along with thousands of Dutchmen that had lived in the East Indies for decades, leading to eventual negotiations between the Dutch government in exile and the Insulindian government of Sukarno. The Dutch delegates had few options due to the situation the Dutch army and navy in the region found themselves in and accepted the independence of Insulindia from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \n\nFor many, the loss of the East Indies showed the cracks in colonialism. The loss of Indonesia also represent the current financial problems the Netherlands face for many outside the government, as the reconstruction of the nation continues at the pace of a snail and many fantasize of how fast reconstruction could have been if the Netherlands wouldn't have lost the important resources of Indonesia."

POLITICS_WILHELMINA_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nAugust 31st, 1880\nThe Hague, South Holland, Kingdom of the Netherlands\n§W--------------§!\nQueen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands is known by many as a strong-willed monarch with a forceful personality, representative of the dutch mentality of not beating around the bush. Wilhelmina would become the queen of the Netherlands at a very young age when her father died in 1890, forcing her mother, Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, to represent the nation as regent. She would later be crowned in 1898 and married Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1901. While trying to maintain the idea of Dutch neutrality as the head of state, Wilhelmina had a personal dislike of the United Kingdom, partly due to the annexation of the Boer republics. Her personal dislike of the British would increase during the First Weltkrieg, as the allied blockade of Germany quickly affected the Netherlands by not allowing any imported goods through. While the Netherlands remained neutral during the First Weltkrieg, Wilhelmina remained wary of invasion from either the east or the south and would often appear without prior notice to inspect the Dutch armed forces, wishing to see the real situation of the army. Her love for the armed forces would often conflict with the elected Dutch governments, who remained eager to cut the military budget in favour for quick economic gains. Wilhelmina never experienced a particular fondness for the 1920s, as the growing threat of social revolution in Europa cornered the Netherlands and forced the tiny nation to align itself with the German Empire. The later invasion of the Netherlands by the armed forces of the French Commune would leave Wilhelmina without much choice, fleeing to Denmark and preparing a possible evacuation to Canada if times would become desperate. \n\nThe war would shape the political view of the queen: a general dislike for the weak government that had allowed the Netherlands to fall to the French combined with ther pre-existing love for the armed forces would shape her new ideas of a liberated government: a strong cabinet formed by the people that had acted in the war. However, the liberation of the Netherlands would show a return of the old traditional parties and politicians instead. \n\nWilhelmina's health started to fail in 1947, forcing her to cede temporary monarchial duties to Juliana. Current talks about abdication have been popular among both the public and in the royal family, as Wilhelmina, while caring for her people, slowly seems unable to deal with the duties of monarchy in this changing world."

krg_hol.0.t: "Trial of Johan Böhmers"
krg_hol.0.d: "Beginning the special trials outside of the anti-occupational tribunal, Johan Böhmers has been brought in front of the jury under accusations of treason and collaboration with the French occupation government. Böhmer was a known totalist agitator in the Netherlands prior to the invasion, leaving the SDAP and becoming a member of the Patriotten. Founding the archeological assocation of the Patriotten, he would later expand his association to include general culture in the Netherlands and the development of it, becoming part of the Patriotten party organisation as the chairman of proletariat culture. His research was mostly focussed on Frisia and funded by the party. The lawyers of the Dutch state have considerable proof of connections between Böhmers and the French military occupation police, with Böhmers being an advisor for them in Frisia. \n\nThe court has thus found Böhmers to be guilty of treason against the state and collaboration with the enemy. The court has sentenced Böhmer to 10 years in prison for his crimes."
krg_hol.0.a: "Okay"

krg_hol.1.t: "Trial of Bertus Smit"
krg_hol.1.d: "Bertus Smit has been an important member of the Patriotische propaganda ministry during the occupation, being the highest profile member of the ministry to have been caught by liberation forces, as most of them choose the cyanide pill over execution. Bertus Smit, also known as Adalberto Smit, has been a known totalist since the 1930s, inspired by Mussolini's approach to nationalism in a left-wing manner. After visiting his great inspiration in Turin, Smit started to promote totalist ideology in the Netherlands. His collaboration with the French occupation government has, however, been difficult to prove: Bertus Smit did not make himself popular among the members of the Patriotten, often by advocating for right-wing ideas being adopted into totalism, and would quickly be arrested by the French military police for insulting the French Commune in his writing, leading to him being completely removed from the office and spending the rest of the war in a cell in The Hague. With this situation, the court has been unable to properly find him guilty of the accusation of treason, as his lawyer argues that Smit himself was a victim of the Patriotische government."
krg_hol.1.a: "This is why being a lawyer isn't for me..."

krg_hol.2.t: "The Depressing Case of Tante Jet"
krg_hol.2.d: "Henriette Goverdine Anna Roland Holst-van der Schalk, also known as Jet, had been a known christian syndicalist since the 1920s. Reading Karl Marx's Das Kapital when she married poet Herman Gorter, Jet quickly became a known advocate for revolutionary socialism. She became a member of the SDAP when she was 27 and became member of the party organisation in 1900. As the delegate for the SDAP to the Internationale, she came to know many prominent revolutionaries of her time, such as Trotsky and Rosa Luxembourg. Her activities in the SDAP quickly lead to the Dutch police keeping her under close watch. \n\nThe invasion of the Netherlands would be a time of joy for many sympathisers. However, Tante Jet would not know the same joy: suffering from depressive disorders and anorexia, she turned to christianity and Jezus, which in turn would lead to a political turn to christian syndicalism. Her opposition to the Patriotten government, combined with her wealth, would make her a target for the increasingly aggressive collaborators. With the return of German troops to the Netherlands, Tante Jet's fortune would be claimed by the Patriotten government and ministry of public finances. Later that week, she would be arrested and found guilty of severe treason against syndicalist principles by publicly embracing religious motives in her works. She was sentenced to work in a labour camp in 1944, at the age of 74, leading to a worsening of her mental and physical state. When she was liberated by German troops, they only encountered an empty shell of the old women known as Tante Jet, on the verge of death. Medical care has been keeping her alive for almost 3 years now, but death finally caught her while she was sleeping today, ending the tragedy of Tante Jet."
krg_hol.2.a: "Rest in Peace"

krg_hol.3.t: "Suurhoff condemms Totalism"
krg_hol.3.d: "In an surprising turn of events for an otherwise silent day in the Netherlands, PvdA member Ko Suurhoff had publicly condemmed the actions of the Russian state, comparing the actions taken against 'unloyal' minorities to the atrocities committed by the totalist regimes across Europe during their persecution of christianity. In his speech, Ko rallied the masses against totalism and national populism, regarding both ideologies as a threat to the liberal and individual lifestyle enjoyed in the Netherlands. He would end his speech while the crowd cheered him on for more. \n\nThe speech of Ko Suurhoff has already been met with criticism from both the RSP for comparing the crimes of totalism to the crimes of the Russian government on a moral level. The VNH has not publicly criticized Suurhoff for his speech, but more radical members of the party have been hostile towards Suurhoff and the PvdA and are not pleased by the speech given by Suurhoff."
krg_hol.3.a: "A nice speech, mister Suurhoff"

krg_hol.4.t: "Queen Wilhelmina Abdicates"
krg_hol.4.d: "Gathered at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, Queen Wilhelmina gave her final speech as Queen as she proclaimed her abdication to the people of Amsterdam. Her daughter, and Crown Princess, Juliana was crowned Queen Juliana of the Netherlands.\n\nWilhemina, who has ruled the Netherlands since 1890 following the death of the late King William III, has deemed it necessary to abdicate as her own health has claimed the best of her abilities. It is reported that it was the decision of Juliana to wish for her mother to push on until the war was over in Europe, and such she did.\n\nEven though they cheered for their newly crowned Queen Juliana, they were still unable stem the flow of tears for the grand old lady who was stepping down."
