 CHI_authoritarian_socialist_party: "RARW"
 CHI_authoritarian_socialist_party_long: "§ARepresentative Assembly of Revolutionary Workers§!\n\n§LSyndicalism was slow to take root in China due to its small industry. Chen Duxiu's Syndicalist Party of China actively cooperated with the KMT and essentially became the worker's branch of the latter. The party itself split into two factions after the KMT victory in the Five Province Wars: §RUnionists§! following the orthodox syndicalist model, and §AVanguardists§! who supported Leninism and Maximism.\n\nThe §AVanguardists§! split from the CSP and established the §ARepresentative Assembly of Revolutionary Workers§!. Although there had been disagreements between Chen Shaoyu's Maximalist faction following the British line, and Guo Moruo's Leninist faction aiming to integrate leninism with tridemism, the RARW remained united when criticizing the Guangzhou Government for not being dedicated enough to labor liberation and revolution. Attracting disillusioned former Minsheng Faction hardliners and young guards of the §3Kuomintang§!, the Assembly, aka Gongdaihui, remained a fringe party in Guangzhou's political playground.§!"

Chen Duxiu's Syndicalist Party of China actively cooperated with the KMT and essentially became the worker's branch of the latter. The party itself split into two factions after the KMT victory in the Five Provinces War: §RUnionists§! following the orthodox syndicalist model, and §AVanguardists§! who supported Leninism and Maximism.\n\nUnionists were labor movement leaders operating in the more industrialized pockets of China, such as the former Legation cities, Yangtze Delta, Beijing, Wuhan, Shenyang and Guangzhou. Tolerated by Chen Jiongming and his pro-trade union stance, and served as a close ally of §3Kuomintang§!, the Unionists quickly adapted to the new democratic united front, forming the §RAll-China Federation of Trade Unions(ACFTU)§! based on the French CGT. Friendly to both the §3Kuomintang§! and the §SCZGP§!, the ACFTU is not influential enough to rule on its own, but its clout can be a decisive kingmaker. Should the Chinese industry begin to take off, it may expand its influence among the emerging working class.§!"
 CHI_social_democrat_party: "CZGP"
 CHI_social_democrat_party_long: "§SThe China Zhi Gong Party§!\n\n§LLiterally the Public Interest Party of China, the §SCZGP§! had always stood at the forefront of the federalist movement. Its unyielding social democratic views and dedication to a western-style, multi-party democracy had won the support of the progressive bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and westernized Chinese diaspora elites. \n\nFormed in 1925 by Governor Chen Jiongming following his rebellion against Sun Yat-sen, the §SCZGP§! had a tense relationship with the KMT throughout the 1930s. The National Resistance War would prove to be almost catastrophic for the §SCZGP§!, due to the betrayal of its allies, Hong Zhaolin's Old Guangdong Clique, and Chen Lianbo's Merchant Corp. Retreated to Chongqing, §3Kuomintang§! and §SCZGP§! reluctantly reconciled under Japanese pressure. \n\nThe aged Chen Jiongming retired from political life and participated in social activism among Chinese expatriates, raising funds and goods for the war. Now, Chen Qiyou, Jiongming's former secretary, and second-in-command had taken charge of the §SCZGP§!. This time, there wasn't concessions to local patronage and warlord legacy, no compromise to the old establishment. Becoming the backbone of the civil service and cracking KMT dominance in the National Revolutionary Army, the CZGP had the institutional freedom to put real democratic ideals to practice - the untainted, earliest vision of Jiongming."

 CHI_revolutionary_republican_party: "KMT - Mainstream"
 CHI_revolutionary_republican_party_long: "§3Kuomintang - Mainstream§! \n\n§LThe §3Kuomintang§!, or Nationalist Party of China, is well known for its long-term struggles during the National Revolution, the Qing Restoration, and the Imperial Collapse. In the interwar era following the failed Northern Expedition, the party scattered: Soong Ching-ling's Provisional Action Committee (PAC) established Jiangxi-Fujian National Revolutionary Base Area in the dense forests and mountains, combining revolutionary ideals with grassroot rural movement praxis, while the central committee evacuated to Paris, creating the pro-Internationale Reorganized Comrades Association. The more nationalistic right-wing worked with southwestern military strongmen to bide their time.\n\nAfter the Five Provinces War, the PAC reinforced their local dominance due to adaptation to Chinese realities. Distancing itself from Paris and London in favor of the Jiangxi-Fujian experience of mass line, peasant associations and democratic united front, the new §3Kuomintang§! was nicknamed "margarine syndicalist" by their Internationale comrades. \n\nDespite its close cooperation with §SCZGP§! during the Second Sino-Japanese War, it's radical agenda rose controversy over its federalist partners and Beiyang rivals, while  §Zthe right-wing minority§!, led by Li Zongren, are ready to assume control over the party's course. For Chairwoman Soong, the challenge is just the beginning.§!"
 CHI_social_liberal_party: "CDL"
 CHI_social_liberal_party_long: "§OChina Democratic League§!\n\n§LA loose political coalition founded during the second Sino-Japanese war by liberal intellectuals, guilds socialists and chambers of commerce from all over China, CDL as a party had never been as tight-knit as Kuomintang. Although some admiring socialism and progressivism while others are conservative classical liberals, the were brought together by their abhorrence to the Beiyang government, therefore joining Guangzhou.\n\nAlthough §OCDL§! advocates right-wing liberal economic policies, its still accept the progressive ideas of Kuomintang and Zhi Gong Party. Yet §OCDL§! is critical of Sun Yat-sen's Pentacameralism system, together with the complicated dispute with §3Kuomintang§! in the past , making them natural ally with the §SCZGP§!. But no matter how many disputes within and without the party, §OCDL§! will always be committed to building a Chinese democracy that can truly empower the people.§!"
 CHI_market_liberal_party: "NDCA"
 CHI_market_liberal_party_long: "§INational Democratic Construction Association§!\n\n§LSince the end of the Qing Dynasty, the development of Chinese national enterprises had been fraught with obstacles: fierce competition from the unrestricted inflow of foreign goods, internal political turmoils, predatory political system, and scarcity of factors of production such as land, capital, and labor. Some reluctantly dedicated themselves to developing Chinese industry, while others became compradors and speculators. Ironically, the total war against Japan allowed them to grow. Moving to western provinces such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, Chinese businesses enjoyed the absence of foreign competitors, intense wartime demands for import substitution, and the protection of military authorities. After the war ended, capitalists across China formed a new party - §INational Democratic Construction Association§!(NDCA) - to represent their interests. Led by vocational educator and industrialist Huang Yanpei, the §INDCA§! comprises industrial magnates across the country. Staunchly advocating infant industry protection, import substitution strategy, and functional market, the party was divided politically. A faction led by Chang Kia-ngau, Lu Zuofu, and H. H. Kung attempted to adapt to the southern tripartite state-cooperative-private mixed economy. In contrast, the conservatives, led by Qian Yongming, Wu Dingchang, and J. Pincuet Fu supported the Beiyang government. As a result, the §INDCA§! kept swinging between both sides and will cooperate with any political force that would safeguard capitalist interests.§!"
 CHI_social_conservative_party: "KMT - Patriots"
 CHI_social_conservative_party_long: "§ZKuomintang - Patriots§! \n\n§LThe §3Kuomintang§!, or Nationalist Party of China, is well known for its long-term struggles during the National Revolution, the Qing Restoration, and the Imperial Collapse. In the interwar era following the failed Northern Expedition, the party scattered: Soong Ching-ling's Minquan faction established Jiangxi-Fujian National Revolutionary Base Area in the dense forests and mountains, combining revolutionary ideals with grassroot rural movement praxis, while the central committee evacuated to Paris, creating the pro-Internationale Minsheng faction. The more nationalistic right-wing Minzu faction worked with southwestern military strongmen to bide their time.\n\nThe right-wing §ZKuomintang - Patriots§! (Ai Guo Pai) initially pushed its own agenda of national reunification by military might instead of social revolution, a view changed following Soong's reconciliation. A wing of military officers and hardline cadres united under General Li Zongren, its right-wing nature does not necessarily translate to conservative or reactionary. Rather, the §ZKMT-P§! strongly emphasizes defense, identity and national capacity building, seeing the progressive policies as means of national rejuvenation rather than endgoals. Li envisioned a society based on his Guangxi experience: "self-rule" by breaking the local patron-client system and establishing a direct interface to the state, "self-sufficiency" by promoting internal economic circulation and state corporations, and "self-defence" by ambtious military expansion and modernization programs.When the country craves for peace and progress, Li Zongren's chances are slim. But if the winds change, China will see the rise of a wild card, or more exactly, a wild wolf.§!"
 CHI_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Beiyang Sympathizers"
 CHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "§gBeiyang Sympathizers§!\n\n§LNationalism, democracy and socialism are not always welcomed by everyone in China. Guangzhou's empowerment of commoners directly conflicts with various opponents, which also includes several moderatists with historical ties with the Beiyang establishment: former localist affiliates, enlightened gentry, old parliamentarians, etc. Despite their conservative and anti-revolutionary attitude, they lack the ability to engage in open hostilities with Guangzhou, for now.§!"
 CHI_paternal_autocrat_party: "CRS Remnants"
 CHI_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "§lChina Reconstruction Society Remnants§!\n\n§LThe China Reconstruction Society was a cabal of Totalist and Savinkovist radicals within the National Revolutionary Army and the ZhongTeJu, the former party intelligence branch of the §3Kuomintang§!. Rather than dying for the country, its members were more willing to die for their supreme leader, Dai Chunfeng, and they did. After tensions within the Chongqing united front developed against their ambition, the §lCRS§! staged a coup to replace the SCPC with their securocracy, only to be crushed by ZhongTeJu's rival agency, the inter-institutional "Special Operations Section of the Southwestern Political Council" led by Zhou Enlai. Dai Chunfeng fall from the building to his death during his escape, and his inner circle members of Hu Zongnan, Gui Yongqing, Gu Shunzhang and Xia Xi were purged in mass crackdowns. However, damages had already been made, as myriads of key figures of the Chongqing united front died, most notably Deng Yanda, then Chairman of Kuomintang. Shaking the already fragile trust between the parties of SCPC, the coup paved way for the departization of the National Revolutionary Army. Although the §lCRS§! is nothing but an awkward historical wound now, its consipiracy had set a §Ldangerous precedent...§!§!"

 CHI_national_populist_party_long: "§r"Reactionaries"§!\n\n§LNationalism, democracy and socialism are not always welcomed by everyone in China. Guangzhou's empowerment of commoners directly conflicts with various opponents: monarchists, millenarian cultists, warlords, bandits, former collaborators, compradors, and even restitution corps of conservative landlords against peasant unions. They had been reportedly posing great threats to Guangzhou's rural governance, attacking rural task force, suppressing peasant movements, committing organized crime and engaging in various anti-government activities. The factions in Guangzhou have disagreements on how to tackle them. Some argued that they are legitimately resisting the dissolution of traditions and violation of private properties by the mob rule of the unionized peasants, others view them enemy of the people that must be hammered. Regardless of pardon or suppression, they will be the largest obstacle to Guangzhou's rule if not treated properly.§!"
 
 ### Ideas ###
 CHI_idea_victory_over_japan: "Victory"
 CHI_idea_victory_over_japan_desc: "We did it! For 8 years, we stood against the Japanese invaders in the National Resistance War. When we rejoice and heal our wounds, we must not forget numerous brave men and women sacrificed their lives for the fatherland. Through our sacrifice came victory, and through victory has come peace. But what have we achieved? A literal white peace while our oppressors are still sharping their blades across the sea, and oppressing people like us. What did we get? A nation still divided, left battered and bruised in the smoldering ruins?[CHI_victory_war_support_factor_text]"
 CHI_idea_southwestern_political_council: "Southwestern Political Council"
 CHI_idea_southwestern_political_council_desc: "The best single word to summarize our government is ambiguity. We are the Southwestern Political Council, a legally undefined patchwork of actual provinces controlled by our member parties, revolutionary base areas, military units nominally under Beijing, unions, communes, partisan cells, and military administrations. Instead of a government, we are more like a mixture of a tutelage committee, a revolutionary united front, and a league of autonomous provinces. This may work under revolutionary laws and wartime emergency measures, but contradictions arise in peacetime. Such ambiguity is the main dispute within our ranks: some proposed to nationalize our military assets and joining the central government as individual provinces after peaceful reconciliation with Beijing; some wants to preserve the status quo to bargain with Beijing, others remained vigilant, ready to defend ourselves from the northern reactionary strongmen. If we do not settle this dispute soon, it will hit our cause hard."
 CHI_idea_towards_great_unity: "Towards Great Unity"
 CHI_idea_towards_great_unity_desc: "Patriotism, democracy, and socialism are the future of the nation that both the Federalists and the Nationalists agreed, each developing their own different interpretations. Our definition of democracy is different to that of the Accord, combining the legacy of the Third International, the democratic and republican ideas of the Xin Hai Revolution, and the grassroots practices of rural China.\n\nThe failure of the Third International lay in its dogmatic and impractical over-involvement in domestic and foreign affairs, but we were much more flexible. During the war we adopted moderate policies: allowing foreign capital, land rent reductions, a certain degree of centralization, and cooperation with the warlord reactionaries. Now that the war is over, everyone is asking: Should we return to our roots and follow our ideals, or reconcile with the reality like Dr. Sun and Governor Chen once did? What kind of society are we really trying to build? "
 CHI_idea_dissidents_or_just_reactionaries: "Dissidents, or Just Reactionaries?"
 CHI_idea_dissidents_or_just_reactionaries_desc: "We are not the most pleasant government. We unionize laborers against their masters, we hang the local tyrants and evil gentry on the lampposts, we storm cult cells and opium dens, we break the natural patriarchal authority, not to mention those suspicious land reforms proposals.\n\nWe might be federalists or nationalists, but are revolutionaries at first, and that's what revolutionaries do. Although we haven't even started yet, there are already a myriad of people actively opposing our policies: bandits, landlord homecoming corps, Yiguandao, warlord remnants, compradors, and most importantly, the Beiyang government. We tolerate them because we need them to fight the Japanese, or we could not spare resources to eliminate them, not because we support them. Shall we sacrifice the few for the masses, or continue our moderate approach to prevent backlash?"
 CHI_idea_NRA_1: "National Revolutionary Army"
 CHI_idea_NRA_1_desc: "The current National Revolutionary Army had expanded exponentially during the war, absorbing myriads of former warlord troops, worker revolutionary guards, base area peasant militias and guerilla cells, each bringing their unique weapons, uniforms and structures. Although old clique differences had arguably disappeared, the overextended NRA is still a walking organizational disaster and logistics nightmare ripe with organizational chaos, localism, factionalism, anti-meritocratic seniority system and labyrinthine structure. Concerned military modernizers are worried about our guerilla habits, Nationalists and Syndicalists feared that the factions along the line of geography and seniority could taint NRA's idealism, while federalists and liberals saw the danger of the army intervening in politics. If we are to ready our army for modern warfare, the Whampoa legacy must learn to adapt."
 CHI_idea_NRA_2: "National Revolutionary Army"
 CHI_idea_NRA_2_desc: "After some efforts, we are eventually able to standardize our uniforms, drill codes and command chains. We have reorganized our army into three interchangeble roles: field armies, local garrisons and guerillas. We have also started to compile first-hand experiences, successful practices and tactical innovations ventions from the veterans.  Bad news is the logistics department is still complaining, and they will continue for a few years until we find reliable supplies of standardized firearms."

 CHI_development_modifier: "Our Development At a Glance"
 CHI_development_modifier_desc: "China had long been a developmental backwater even before the war: a public colony for the great powers, a marsh of ignorance and numbness, and a country half a century behind the global standard. The prosperity in the Qing decade was merely a semi-colonial system that only benefitted a few warlords and compradors, contributing little to the human development of the majority of the population. To add insult to injury, the myriad civil wars and the subsequent Japanese invasion terminated all hopes of peaceful development. As the dust settled, we finally have the opportunity to drag the Sick Man of Asia to the 20th century.

CHI_consultative_conference: "Political Consultative Conference"
CHI_consultative_conference_desc: "Without discussion there is only autocracy. Without cooperation there is only imposition of rigidity. The North brooks no discussion and will fail for it.

CHI_bitter_peace: "The Bittersweet Peace"
CHI_bitter_peace_desc: "The final signing of the peace with Japan is one that is equal parts humiliating and joyful. Their withdrawal was not through some immense effort of strength or tactical success on our part. We simply refused to die longer than they refused to try to kill us. No doubt Beijing will expect us to contribute to the reparations."

CHI_reclamatory_justice: "Justice and Reclamation"

CHI_CRS_coup_legacy: "Legacy of the CRS Coup"
CHI_CRS_coup_legacy_desc: "The China Reconstruction Society (CRS) sought to reforge the country in the image of Savinkov's Russia, seeking absolution in a strong man and a strong party organisation. However their impatience meant they went too far, too fast and they did not kill everyone who might oppose them. And the moment they slipped up, the reaction destroyed them.\n\nThere are still remnants in the countryside who support the ideals of this organisation, but the near-death experience of many in the current leadership means their lofty idealism has been scarred not only by the brutality of the Japanese, but also the betrayal, once again, by their own countrymen."

The situation to the north is unbearable and the relationship with Beijing is not a settled conversation.\n\nWe must formalise and organise our troops, strengthen their resolve, and prepare to once again fight.

krg_chi.1.t: "Call of the Revolution"
krg_chi.1.d: "As the Qing Empire fell into chaos in 1936 the long-held dream of an all-China republic would once again flair through the south of the nation and would see its adehrants strive towards its warmth. The Guangzhou Government, led by members of CZGP and KMT, is an achievement of republicans who fight against imperialism and autocracy.\n\nAs the League of Eight Provinces collapsed in the February of 1936, Liangguang and Hunan seceded, and the KMT rose up in the Jiangzhe-Fujian guerrilla zone. The NRA led by the KMT fought on and would quickly occupy Nanchang. Qi Xieyuan's disorganised and disorderly forces would be quickly destroyed in the battles over the province, and as the people of the 5 provinces could no longer stand the LEP's rule anymore, they rose up and helped NRA soldiers fight against the LEP. Although Qi Xieyuan would destroy Chen Tiaoyuan's forces and force Chen to escape to Fengtian, he would find his army unable to stop the NRA from marching on. Qi Xieyuan would find himself executed after a public trial backdropped against the hearty cheers of the people Nanjing.\n\nIn the south, Chen Jiongming would rally and mobilise the CZGP and the Productive People's Party towards the destruction of Ma Ji's old Guangxi Clique, and with that peace would finally come to Liangguang. At the same time Zhao Hengti would escape from Hunan and events would see Tang Shengzhi become the governor of the province who would possess strong CGZP and KMT sympathies.\n\nThe chance for the republicans final strike against imperialism would occur in 1937 as in the face of all their crisises the Qing would be completely disorganised. With Hunan's, Yunnan's and the Sichuan KMT's and the Federalist forces' help, the Southern Forces would reach an agreement to attack the Qing Empire in the 2nd National Protection War. They would take Wuhan and then secured Hubei in later 1938. After Wang's assassination and Soong Ching-ling became the leader of KMT, the KMT would trend towards more liberal policies and outlooks and be greatly more amnicable toward the Federalists. Yet both parties still possess points of major contention towards the other."

There was little ceremony in the matter, and aside from a few photographers and a couple of press-men the event was scarcely attended, despite being signed on the same site as the first treaty of Shimonoseki, 53 years ago.\n\nAs the event ended, the clouds overhead burst and it began to rain. Nobody stayed to talk past a brief exchange of pleasantries, and the Chinese left to their respective governments while the Japanese were left with their copy of the treaty and a sense of wonderment at how these people had managed to bring them to these terms."

In the case of Vietnam, although it's an ancient imperial dynasty, it has collaborated with the myriad occupiers of the region and defended the actions of Japanese troops which has led to the country reaching its breaking point with a massive leftist uprising across not only Vietnam but also Laos and Cambodia. \n\n These events are similar to our own failed revolution that caused German intervention that restored the Manchu Tyrant for another 20 years and allowed the Westerners and Japan to tighten their grip on our country, a fate that without outside intervention would seem likely to fall upon our Vietnamese brothers. However, with the defeat of the northern forces in our civil war and the end of the century of humiliation, we could intervene and save our southern brothers from the wrath of Japan."

Although the NRA fought bravely, Japanese forces were too strong and lots of lands fell. Also, there were traitors and collaborators like the Merchant Corps led by Chen Lianbo and Hong Zhaolin, one of the generals that Chen Jiongming trusted most, defected to Japanese and became their lapdog.\n\nAs a part of negotiations between KMT and Federalists and because of many faults Chen Jiongming had, Chen Jiongming retired and Chen Qiyou became the leader of CZGP and also temporary president of the government.\n\nThe first result of KMT-Federalists alliance was Chongqing Government. In Chongqing, KMT and Federalists cooperated closely, even these members in KMT and CZGP who were hostile, became comrades. With Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui's soldiers winning the bloodiest battle in Wuhan, Japanese stopped with their disastrous defeat and Operation Ichi Go totally failed.

But now the Heroic City's under attack again - by its own protector.\n\nThe Beiyang Army commanded by Chen Yi was authorized to take over Japanese and collaborator properties and reestablish administration over Tianjin. Unfortunately, looting has traditionally been seen as the right of the victorious after the war, and Tianjiners welcoming their Beiyang liberators soon found themselves targets of the predatory rule of the military government. Soldiers were seen burning, looting, \"taxing\" and defiling through the commercial streets built in the legation era. he officers extorted bribes from the local bourgeoisie, plundered factories, firms and warehouses with trucks and created a prosperous black market. Similar situation happens in various liberated cities, but the crime in the Heroic City drew national attention for its gravity when bandits with Arisaka rifles broke into the girls' dormitory of Nankai University. \n\nProtestors in Tianjin claiming the takeover is a \"rob-over\" and the Beiyang Army is no different to Japanese invaders.

Knowing that the Beiyang Army will not yield easily, workers built barricades with barbed wires and steel bars outside the gates to show their resolution.\n\nSoon the atmosphere replaced temporarily by awe and curiosity, as piercing bright lights shone through the streets soaked by cold rain and the deafening roars of engines engulfed the entire district. A squadron of Fengtian Type 4 medium tank rolled out, with heavily armed infantry following close behind. Curiosity gave way to fear, and fear gave way to dread. The workers couldn't believe what they were hearing, demanding confirmation and giving each other incredulous looks. \n\nThen a lieutenant colonel shouted orders, and the soldiers reluctantly raised their weapons and began firing over the crowd, sending them into a panic. 75mm tank guns fired high explosive charges that illuminated the entire street, obliterating the steel barricades and the defenders behind them. The soldiers advanced behind the fleeing workers, retaking Santiaoshi region by the order of General Chen Yi. \n\nThe worker, astounded by the violence upon them, turned outrageous. While some tried to tend the trampled during the frenzy, others threw anything they could find at the soldiers before they were mown down by turret-mounted machine guns.

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.2.a: "We're in Driving Distance now!"

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.3.t: "Wuhan Lost!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.3.d: "With the Beiyang Armies pushing into Jianghan province, Wuhan was soon overran by the tip of the spear. The Guangzhou troops reported facing heavy attacks and near constant pressure from the Northerners as they fought to hold their ground, but ultimately had to retreat or be demolished where they stood.\n\nLosing Wuhan means the Northerners have crossed the Yangtze river, and will no doubt swarm forth from their beach-head like ants."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.3.a: "Then we will kill them like ants."
 
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.4.t: "Beijing Liberated!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.4.d: "With the fall of Beijing to the forces of the Guangzhou government, the Beiyang Government is truly on the ropes now.\n\nAs Guangzhou's troops paused in their campaign to take photos outside the Forbidden City in Tianamen Square, the remnant of the Beiyang Army holding the city retreated back towards Manchuria and toward their last stand."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.4.a: "It'll be over soon."

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.5.t: "Chongqing Lost!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.5.d: "The fall of Chongqing has meant the entire Dongchuan province is close to being taken by the Beiyang armies, the Yangtze crossed at it's upper reaches and the threat of Beiyang forces roaming through Sichuan and Yunnan to fall upon us from the west.\n\nWe must push them back, or cut them off, before they can exploit this opening."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.5.a: "Damnit!"

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.6.t: "Changsha Lost!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.6.d: "With the fall of Changsha the road to Guangzhou is almost open for the Beiyang forces.\n\nThings are looking grim for the Republic now, as the state hangs on but the Northerners are making their advance ever further into our heartlands."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.6.a: "Scramble the troops!"
 
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.7.t: "Luoyang Liberated!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.7.d: "The Ancient Capital of Luoyang has been liberated by the forces of the Guangzhou Republic, showing another victory for the forces of the South in their campaign to push the Beiyang clique out of government and into the history books.\n\nNo doubt the symbolic significance of taking this ancient centre of Chinese civilisation will not be lost on the Northerners."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.7.a: "Ah, Henan!"

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.8.t: "Nanjing Lost!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.8.d: "In a truly disastrous occurence, the city of Nanjing fell to the armies of the Beiyang clique today. The commander of the garrison has fled, and is nowhere to be found, and his men are retreating in disarray into the countryside.\n\nThe Northerners have stopped for a moment to carouse and drink in this ancient capital of the nation, but we must catch our breath and mount a counter attack as soon as we can."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.8.a: "Temporary setback..."

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.9.t: "Xi'an Liberated!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.9.d: "With the fall of Xi'an, Guanzhong province is soon to follow in it's footsteps. The ancient capital has seen many scenes of debauchery, including the sacking of it's Banner in the 1911 Xinhei revolution, but the troops of the Guangzhou army conducted themselves well.\n\nWe will demonstrate that the Beiyang are drunks and bandits, and that we are here to save the people."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.9.a: "We're here to help, ma'am."

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.10.t: "Taiyuan Liberated!"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.10.d: "With the capture of Taiyuan in mountainous Jining province, we've proven that the Beiyang armies cannot hide in the mountains or pull any old warlord tricks to evade our forces. Sooner or later we will capture them and force their surrender."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.10.a: "Sooner is better."

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.11.t: "Total Collapse"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.11.d: "Everything has gone to shit frankly, the troops are in disarray and none believes anymore in the cause they are supposed to fight for. \n\nDesertion is on the rise, and the people are not responding to the exhortations of their leaders as they once did."
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.11.a: "Take the gun out your mouth, sir!"

krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.12.t: "The Final Blow"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.12.d: "Prepare the hammer to fall, because we are on track to finish the job. Our fighters are eager, our people are happy and the news every day is checked for the answer to the question.\n\nIs the war over?"
krg_chi_ccw_exhaust.12.a: "Soon."

krg_chi_ccw.100.t: "Victory"
krg_chi_ccw.100.d: "We have defeated the northern Beiyang Government and reunited the country."
krg_chi_ccw.100.a: "Forward to our shared future"

krg_chi_pol.1.t: "The Assembly Begins"
krg_chi_pol.1.d: "With the great resolve of the people's of the Guangzhou Republic, we gather together those representatives who can participate to write a constitutional document to guide the country and to shape the new China that we have been struggling so long and earnestly for.\n\nWhat the document will look like will depend on the views and agendas of those present, but it is guaranteed to be a true statement of intent for the country in both the present and the future. We can only hope that history will look kindly on the work we commence here today."
krg_chi_pol.1.a: "So Begins the Assembly."

krg_chi_pol.2.t: "Constituent Assembly - Basic Frameworks"
krg_chi_pol.2.d: "How exactly should the nation work? A president so strong he is practically an emperor seems abherrant to many, pointing to the excesses of the Fengtian Clique in the North as how this could go wrong. Others argue if the National Assembly is too powerful, the country will devolve into another patchwork of warlordisms as soon as it is united.\n\nAfter discussion back and forth, the compromise was reached that there would be a semi-Presidential system, with checks and balances including a National Assembly and a Judiciary."
krg_chi_pol.2.a: "An Excellent Choice"

krg_chi_pol.3.t: "Constituent Assembly - Principles"
krg_chi_pol.3.d: "There has been some discussion between the representatives about what exact form the preamble of the constitutional text should take. One faction states that it should include the phrase 'the guiding principles of the Republic of China are Patriotism, Democracy and Socialism'.\n\nA second group argue that this will make the constitution fallible and open to being amended or replaced at a future date if that specific text is included. They prefer for this section to be omitted from the preamble.\n\nUltimately, without a strong direction in one direction or the other, a vote was held."
krg_chi_pol.3.a: "No, the constitution will not be ideological."
krg_chi_pol.3.b: "We must institutionalize what we have been fighting for."

krg_chi_pol.4.t: "Constituent Assembly - Executive"
krg_chi_pol.4.d: "The exact alignment of the government came into discussion today. The representatives tossed the idea back and forth about who exactly the Cabinet should be answering to, if the President is the leading figure in the state as it was in America, or if the President is more of a figurehead for the nation to rally behind, and the Premier in the Parliamentary Assembly should lead, somewhat like the British system."
krg_chi_pol.4.a: "The Cabinet Should be answerable to the legislature."
krg_chi_pol.4.b: "The Cabinet Should be answerable to the president."

krg_chi_pol.5.t: "Constituent Assembly - Legislative"
krg_chi_pol.5.d: "While all representatives agreed that a bicameral house of parliament would be ideal, the question of where legislation would be raised and where it would be approved appeared to fox some of them.\n\nOne faction advocated that legislation should be the executive preserve of the government, who would introduce laws and the houses would then vote on them and send them back for reworking as needed.\n\nAnother stated that they believed any elected member of the assembly should be able to bring a vote on a bill to be written into law, so that when the government changed during an election, there would be people capable of writing laws in all parts of the house, not just the civil servants and the government."
krg_chi_pol.5.a: "Legislation should be independent."
krg_chi_pol.5.b: "Legislation should be a branch of the government."

krg_chi_pol.6.t: "Constituent Assembly - Judiciary"
krg_chi_pol.6.d: "The matter of the strength of the judiciary came up between the representatives. There was a long conversation about the limit of their power in overturning what the legislature votes on.\n\nSome wanted a small bench with a few judges selected and approved by the legislature but then serving for life (or until they choose to step down).\n\nOthers were against the idea of semi-unelected officials having a determining say vs the will of the people as demonstrated by their elected representatives.\n\nA third faction seemed uncertain as to what they wanted, willing to be swayed by persuasive arguments either way."
krg_chi_pol.6.a: "Not another U.S. Supreme Court."
krg_chi_pol.6.b: "A powerful judiciary will balance the legislature."

krg_chi_pol.7.t: "Constituent Assembly - Control"
krg_chi_pol.7.d: "It is something that is not loudly discussed, yet is all too common. A feature of life that has blighted everyone's history and a symptom of government failure and warlordism. Corruption.\n\nSome representatives are eager for an independant anti-corruption commission empowered to take down any who might be corrupt, no matter how powerful they are.\n\nOthers recommend letting the legislature self-regulate, stating any corruption commission would just become a tool of removing political opponents on potentially spurious financial grounds."
krg_chi_pol.7.a: "Make it small - the legislature can do the job."
krg_chi_pol.7.b: "Independent supervision eliminates corruption."

krg_chi_pol.8.t: "Constituent Assembly - Examination"
krg_chi_pol.8.d: "The Civil Service Examination is perhaps one of China's most ancient traditions. However historically it has become one of it's great issues. The tales of men working as scholars and never lifting a finger to do something productive their whole lives just to try and pass an exam of the classics are known to many, and we cannot afford such decadence in the Modern China. The Taiping Rebellion came from a failed scholar, and arguably started the shaking of the core of Chinese society in the process.\n\nThe idea however of just letting anyone near the levers of power is also a wild one, and antithetical to centuries of progress in the country.\n\nThe question thus becomes, how important are these examinations? Should discretion be a factor in hiring or will we adhere strictly to the outcome of the tests only?"
krg_chi_pol.8.a: "Don't make it a kingmaker..."
krg_chi_pol.8.b: "Meritocracy is China's precious tradition."

krg_chi_pol.9.t: "Constituent Assembly - Structure of Power"
krg_chi_pol.9.d: "The Republic of China is obviously the name of the state, but what exactly does that mean? Will it be regional states on a federal model, as the Americans once had, with slightly different codes of law and an overarching federal government?\n\nOr will it be a state that revolves around a single sun, in perfect harmony, with all decisions going down the telegraph wire once they become too big for a local official?"
krg_chi_pol.9.a: "Provincial Autonomy!"
krg_chi_pol.9.b: "What happened twice in American history?"

krg_chi_pol.10.t: "Constituent Assembly - The Capital"
krg_chi_pol.10.d: "The representatives started to discuss where was most suitable for a capital. As they discussed it, they gradually whittled down the options, until one remained. \n\nNo Beijing - we are not another Aisin Gioro or Beiyang Junta.\nNo Wuhan - free drifting in the Yangtze is no fun.\nNo Guangzhou or Fengtian or Xi'an, too far off from the rest of the country.\nEventually all that remained was..."
krg_chi_pol.10.a: "Just Nanjing."

krg_chi_pol.11.t: "Constituent Assembly - The End"
krg_chi_pol.11.d: "With the conclusion of the Assembly, a broadly Federalist constitutional regime has been enacted. Where this will take China, nobody knows, but the shape of the future is set."
krg_chi_pol.11.a: "E Pluribus Unum!"

krg_chi_pol.12.t: "Constituent Assembly - The End"
krg_chi_pol.12.d: "With the conclusion of the Assembly, a broadly Nationalist constitutional regime has been enacted. Where this will take China, nobody knows, but the shape of the future is set."
krg_chi_pol.12.a: "China will stand tall!"

krg_chi_pol.13.t: "First Presidential Election"
krg_chi_pol.13.d: "In the first ever free and fair election in the new Republic of China, the two main contenders for the Presidential Nomination are Chen Qiyou, who led the country through the civil war, and Soong Ching-Ling who was right by his side, helping him with it and co-ordinating the KMT's contribution.\n\nThe election was close as both were broadly popular candidates, but ultimately the people voted and the mandate went to..."
krg_chi_pol.13.a: "CZGP and Chen Qiyou"
krg_chi_pol.13.b: "KMT and Soong Ching-Ling"

krg_chi.1001.t: "Teahouse Chats"
krg_chi.1001.d: "\"Even if China unified peacefully as you advocated, then what? Will China be any way better?\" Being looked straight into the eye, Huang Yanpei sipped his tea to conceal his nervousness.   During a pacifist campaign in Shamin, he met the author of On Protracted War by chance. That Hunanese political analyst invited him to a teahouse for a chat, during which he almost began to doubt his peace movement. Despite the disagreement, he began to like his new tea-mate:\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know.\" Huang sighed,  \"I've seen things…for the last 60 years: endless cycles of order and chaos throughout history. A community, a land, a cause, or even a country, flourished through diligent people conquering hardships. Such good times would erode their challenging spirit. Eventually, everything ended beyond fixing when those strong founders are either gone or become new oppressors, Nothing in history had ever jumped out of this cycle. I am not sure if peaceful unification can end the cycle or merely delay it, but I can see that the people here are looking for a way out. \"\n\n\"That happened when everyone relied on powerful heroes only.\" The man before him lit a Yunnan Chongjiu cigarette,\"Instead of saving themselves, they expected kings and messiahs to shape the history, which kept cycling as the great names came and went. The only new way out is the rule of the people. Only when they are conscious and vigilant, will the rulers not slacken. Only when everyone rises up and takes responsibility for themselves, will society not fall from generation to generation. Democracy, Mr. Huang, is how the national revolution differs from dynastic wars.\" \n\n \"I knew some disagreed, calling the revolutionaries Boxers and Taiping Rebels. What's your take on that?\" \n\n\"Oh, you mean Dr. Fu Ssu-nien? He had a Ph.D. in philosophy from Berlin University.  I am a mudleg self-taught around the paddies. Who am I to argue?\" he shrugged, exhaling a smoke ring. Huang knew that \"mudleg\" understated his influence: the man before him had been south China's leading political analyst and peasant movement activist, proposed the Down to the Countryside Movement in the early 1940s, encouraged millions of educated youths to save the nation through grassroots research and education.\n\n\"How humble for Deng Yanda's comrade-in-arms and the vanguard of Hunnanese federal autonomism! \" Huang complimented,\" I know you kept attacking both KMT and CZGP. Are you trying to lead your political movement?\" The man responded with a drag from the strong Yunnan cigarette, \"Never. We have enough fighters, but few teachers.\""
krg_chi.1001.a: "\"...but I will carry on comrade Yanda's legacies.\""
krg_chi.1001.b: "\"I won't miss that bureaucratic behemoth I once served.\""

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_CHEN_QIYOU_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nDecember 15th, 1892\nHaifeng, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nA doctor can't save China, but a revolutionary can. That's why Chen Qiyou became a federalist. His political career started with armed uprisings and the bombing of a Qing general, making him known to Chen Jiongming. After studying economics in Japan,  Qiyou served as Chen Jiongming's secretary and close confident, despite stepping away from politics during the Sun-Chen schism in the 1920s due to his close connections with the KMT.\n\nAfter several years working as a grassroots administrator and economic bureaucrat, Chen returned to politics, joining Jiongming's CZGP in 1931, and was elected to the Provincial Assembly later that year and quickly regaining the favor of his former mentor. When the Qing hegemony shattered in 1936, Qiyou, as the envoy to Longyan, attempted to mend the rift between the reemergent Kuomintang base areas and Jiongming's province, despite the staunch objection from Jiongming's old guards such as Hong Zhaolin.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of Guangzhou and the disintegration of the old Guangdong clique nearly reverted everything the Federalists had created. But where others saw failures, Qiyou saw opportunities: alliance with Kuomintang to revive the federalist movement. Essentially giving birth to the United Front, also known as the South China Political Committee (SCPC) to outsiders,  Qiyou unquestionably became the new Chairman of the CZGP after Jiongming's retirement and later the chief commissioner of the SCPC in 1946. Building institutions for a new China jointly with Kuomintang, Chen Qiyou will ensure that patronage, local tyranny and warlordism will never taint the federalist movement. This diplomatic, altruistic statesman had swore to continue the unfulfilled dream his mentor once envisioned three decades ago."

 POLITICS_SOONG_CHINGLING_DESC: "§YBorn:§!\nJanuary 27th, 1893\nShanghai, Jiangsu, Qing Empire\n§W--------------§!\nIf Sun Yet-Sen was the Father of the Kuomintang, then Soong Ching-ling is it's Mother. She has seen the KMT go from a fledgling guerilla movement, to a influential political party worthy of being leader of China. Her moderating influence has become legendary, and without her careful touch the KMT would likely have died out long ago.\n\nThe final wife of Dr. Sun, Soong stood with the guerrilas of Longyan, fighting warlord oppression and becoming a woman of compromise and negotiation. When the League collapsed, and Wang Jingwei returned to China to lead the National Revolution, many still looked to Soong as the true, forward-thinking and inspirational leader the KMT needed. With Wang's assasination in 1938, she would get her chance. Taking the reins in a time of crisis, the Left KMT was democratised and taken away from the influence of Syndicalist Europe. Then, with the spectre of Japan looming over China, she was able to reunite the divergent wings of the KMT, though many criticised the 'dilution of Sun's dream' this subsequently caused.\n\nForming a coalition of necessity with the Federalist Government during the Second Sino-Japanese War, she was instrumental in forcing the retirement of the controversial, and to many within the KMT traitorous, President Chen Jiongming. With the war won, she has lead the KMT to victory in the their first Legislative Elections. This victory cemented the dominance of the Leftists, and shows a continued committment to the Guangzhou Constitution and its federalist principles. Many wonder if a former band of revolutionaries can truely govern in a pluralist democratic system, but Madame Soong has overcome larger obstacles in her time."
