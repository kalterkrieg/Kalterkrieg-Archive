krg_news_swi.1.t: "Switzerland Announces the Haute-Savoie Conference"
krg_news_swi.1.d: "Ever since the end of the Second Weltkrieg the question of who owns Haute-Savoie has remained unanswered. When the Federation of French Communes invaded Switzerland in 1937 the Swiss government was forced to recognise the Communards as the sole, legitimate french government. However, when Paris fell in 1944, the Swiss State, led by Henri Guisan, \"joined\" the Allied powers agisnt the Commune and SRI.\n\nAlthough the Aosta Valley was returned to the Kingdom of Italy, Haute-Savoie was to remain in Swiss hands until a united French Governement was acheived. However, such a hope never came to pass with both the French Republic and now the Kingdom of France pressing claims over Haute-Savoie, Guisan has decided to settle the despute once and for all. The So-called Haute-Savoie conference will settle not only the titular dispute, but Switzerland's place in an ever divided world.\n\n But one question remains..."
krg_news_swi.1.a: "Can Swiss neutrality hold?"

krg_news_swi.2.t: "Haute-Savoie Returned to the Kingdom of France"
krg_news_swi.2.d: "The result from the conference is in. The Swiss have decided that their interests are best served by returning Haute Savoie to the ally of the continental hegemon. The Kingdom of France has officially had Haute Savoie returned to it, in a blow to the aspirations of Accordists the world over, and the French Republic's interests specifically.\n\nIt appears they will be toasting to the health of the King in Haute Savoie tonight, as they do in Paris."
krg_news_swi.2.a: "A new age of the old."

krg_news_swi.3.t: "Haute-Savoie Returned to the French Republic"
krg_news_swi.3.d: "The result from the conference is in. The Swiss have decided that their interests are best served by returning Haute Savoie to the liberal democratic alliance of the Accord. The Republic of France has the territory returned to it, in a blow to the aspirations of the Reichspakt toward continental hegemony, and the French Kingdom's interests specifically.\n\nIt appears they will be toasting to the health of the President in Haute Savoie tonight, as they do in Marseille."
krg_news_swi.3.a: "A crippling blow to monarchist legitimacy."

krg_news_swi.4.t: "Haute-Savoie Remains Swiss"
krg_news_swi.4.d: "The result from the conference is in. The Swiss have decided that their interests are best served by retaining Haute Savoie and their neutrality in the matters of world affairs in the process. Neither side receives the tacit recognition of being the France that Switzerland will deal with, in a blow to the asperations of Accordists the world over for a new ally and for the Reichspakt in enlarging German continental hegemony.\n\nIt appears they will be toasting to the health of the General in Haute Savoie tonight, as they do in Zurich."
krg_news_swi.4.a: "And the neutral state grows colder."

krg_news_swi.5.t: "Switzerland Joins the Congress of Nations"
krg_news_swi.5.d: "The Congress of Nations today welcomed it's newest member, the mountainous state of Switzerland. After some back and forth in the backchannels of the Haute Savoie conference, it appears the reason the outcome came the way it did had more reasons than Switzerland's desire to settle the Haute Savoie matter.\n\nThe Swiss Government has also undergone a change, with the military returning control to the Federal Council and Guisan stepping back from politics, so he can instead enjoy a quiet retirement, secure in the knowledge he kept the ship of state steady during stormy times."
