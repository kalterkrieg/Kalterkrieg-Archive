### Ideas ###

POR_presidential_republic: "Portugal Não Pereceu!"
POR_presidential_republic_desc: "Over the last 40 years, its fair to say Portugal hasn't exactly been a beacon of political stability. From a revolution, to a handful of coups, a restoration, another coup, a handful of failed revolutions, another coup, another revolution and finally an impeachment, one could be confident in saying that the nation is a failed state, something to ignore in the grander picture.\n\nArguably though, since the formation of the Second Republic, a great deal of political normalisation has gone on in Portugal. Formed with tense negotiations between Sidonists, Democrats and Nationalists, the new Constitution is a rather centralised, Presidential one heavily divorced from the chaotic parliamentary system of the First Republic and broadly more similar to those found in America. But perhaps more important is the strong system checks and balances that both ensured disgraced President Liberato Pinto couldn't ignore justice after his embezzlement scandal, with the subsequently swift and peaceful transition of power serving as a strong precedent to reinforce civilian authority and faith in the young Republic.\n\nTo say the new Republic is a failed state would be grossly incorrect. For the first time in decades, the Portugese people are governed by a system that is fair and stable. The rule of law and constitutionalism finally means something, and though corruption still plagues corners of the bureaucracy, Lisbon is no longer merely the laughing stock of Europe."
POR_awful_economy: "Signs of an Economic Comeback"
POR_awful_economy_desc: "The lasting legacy of Duarte's reign as King will not be his abrasive personality, nor the oppressive Blueshirts that operated nominally in his name, but rather the complete economic collapse that proceeded the 1937 Revolution. Already struggling from before Black Monday, the ill-fated Rebelo Plan saw little improvement at great cost, practically bankrupting the nation's finances and putting the Kingdom into a death spiral that even the famed Professor Antonio Salazar couldn't fix. The Republic inherited this deplorable position, and for over a decade we've struggled with long-overdue industrialisation policies, economic corruption and costly colonial money sinks. However, the war helped jump start our productivity, and with a long-term responsible government helming the ship a gradual recovery has begun. The road to prosperity will be long and tiresome, but it's no longer just a pipe dream."
POR_colonial_question: "A Pluricontinental Empire"
POR_colonial_question_desc: "Portugal is the oldest empire in Europe. Though her heyday is long gone, the Ultramarine Provinces are a point of pride for Portuguese of all walks of life. It is jewels in the crown such as Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau that have given Portugal her strength for centuries. Tensions with the increasingly politically aware native populations have begun to grow, but their freedom of association under the Second Republic's lenient constitution has placated many intellectuals. Abandoning the empire would be unthinkable.\n\nThe Colonial Question is something that almost everyone wants to ignore. For the entire political establishment, from the most reformist Social Democrat to the most reactionary Integralist, the civilising mission is not in doubt. The Ultramar are core provinces of Portugal, and though the doctrine of Lusotropicalism has been ignored retreat from the colonies is unfathomable. That said, there are those that are beginning to support a move towards self-determination. Most notably, former Presidential Candidate Cunha Leal has begun to outline solutions for colonial autonomy and progress, and though these views haven't broken into the mainstream the fact such a prominent political leader has begun to espouse them signifies a political shift.\n\nPerhaps the coming years will instigate further shifts?"
POR_exiled_king: "The King and His Men"
POR_exiled_king_desc: "King Duarte II's reign lasted just over five years, and during that short period he existed largely as a puppet of the ultra-reactionary Integralists. Politically ambitious but lacking in both legitimacy and the political tact of his predecessor, its not surprising then that his attempt to overrule Prime Minister Hipolito Raposo's failing government ended in disaster for his Kingdom.\n\nAfter the Revolution and his abrupt forced abdication, Duarte absconded to his native Austria where he has remained to this day. In exile, the former King has predictably remained politically active, trying to organise political opposition to the new Republic through lending his support to rival monarchist cabinets. These efforts have not borne fruit for the brusque pretender who never had much popular support to begin with, however it looks unlikely that his persistent machinations nor the efforts of monarchist insurrectionists will end any time soon."

POR_crisis_angola_idea: "Crisis Angola!"
POR_crisis_angola_idea_desc: "The collapse of Mittelafrika at the hands of the AAPM was heard around the world, and no more loudly than in our own African possessions. The country is now fighting an insurgency in the highlands and drylands of Angola, the rebels seeking to evict Portugal from the Ultramarine Province immediately."

## Events ##

krg_por.0.t: "Exiled King Duarte Dead in Traffic Accident"
krg_por.0.d: "Duarte Nuno de Braganca, exiled former monarch of Portugal, died today in a horrific accident on the Wiener Außenring Schnellstraße (Vienna Outer Ring Highway).  He had been quietly living in exile in the Danubian Federation for several years until he met his end when his driver misjudged an overtaking maneuvre. The weather today was noted to have unusually strong wind conditions and the vehicle he was riding in collided with a large truck carrying live animals at high speed. \n\nWhile an enquiry by the Danubian Federal Gendarmerie has been opened, initial reports seem to preclude any foul play. Rather this just appears to be a tragic accident."
krg_por.0.a: "What a way to go" 

krg_por.2.t: "The Collapse of Portugal"
krg_por.2.d: "With the collapse of the Portuguese government, we have been presented with the opportunity to seize Goa."
krg_por.2.a: "After 500 years, it is back in our hands."

krg_por.3.t: "The Collapse of Portugal"
krg_por.3.d: "With the collapse of the Portuguese government, we have been presented with the opportunity to seize Macau."
krg_por.3.a: "Once more ours, just like Hong Kong."

krg_por.4.t: "The Collapse of Portugal"
krg_por.4.d: "With the collapse of the Portuguese government, we have been presented with the opportunity to seize Timor."
krg_por.4.a: "Excellent"

krg_por_angola.0.t: "The Abolition of the Indigene Law"
krg_por_angola.0.d: "The Acto Colonial of 1930, and the Carta Orgânica do Império Colonial Português e Reforma Administrativa Ultramarina of 1933 set a colour-bar on the subjects of our Empire in Angola. We differentiated them by whether or not they were speakers of our language. We took away god given rights that are possessed by all humans and instead made them second class citizens even when they assimilated into our culture.\n\nWe end this colour bar today, and restore the rights of the native peoples of Angola to Portuguese citizenship and the rights inherent within."
krg_por_angola.0.a: "Os Direitos do Homem"

krg_por_angola.1.t: "Ending Labour Conscription"
krg_por_angola.1.d: "A vast issue in Angola and one that has been directly stoking problems there is the policy of labour conscription. The report by Henrique Carlos da Mata Galvão, a colonial administrator, has made it clear that the continuing of the practise instituted under Professor Salazar to try and make the colony more profitable and reduce costs to the government, is doing nothing but provoking uproar and making administration of the province harder.\n\nBy ending the Labour Conscription, we remove a form of modern slavery from Angola, and give ourselves the ability to negotiate more evenly with those opposed to continuing rule in the country."
krg_por_angola.1.a: "Perhaps this will save us"

krg_por_angola.2.t: "Limiting CUF's Influence"
krg_por_angola.2.d: "The Companhia União Fabril (CUF), one of the largest employers nationally and with vast corporate tendrils across our overseas empire, has essentially unbridled control over the northern riverlands which are run by a subsidiary specialising in the extraction of diamonds, their management of the region is unfortunately much alike to that of Leopold of Belgium when he ruled in Congo to the north. For too long we have allowed the company to act as a state within our state in the Province of Angola.\n\nBy taking back control of the administration of the territory and putting curbs and limits on how the CUF corporation can act, we will create a more sustainable diamond industry in the region, though an initial hit to profits and complaints by administrators used to riding roughshod over the natives will cause some dissent at home and abroad."
krg_por_angola.2.a: "Curb excess to survive"

krg_por_angola.3.t: "Failure in Angola!"
krg_por_angola.3.d: "Our attempts to pursue a negotiated settlement have failed, and the ongoing strain of the war in the Ultramarine provinces has put the government into a dire position.\n\nThere is only one solution, we must withdraw our forces and concede the territory to the LNA. The metropole should expect an influx of refugees, so called 'retornados' in the coming weeks and months."
krg_por_angola.3.a: "Catastrophe!"

krg_por_angola.4.t: "An interim solution"
krg_por_angola.4.d: "Our attempts to pursue a negotiated settlement have managed to be somewhat successful, and but the strain of the war in the Ultramarine provinces has shown that we cannot hold the country if it does not wish to be held.\n\nOur negotiations have led us to the conclusion of a power-sharing agreement and improved autonomy for the people's of Angola. Ultimately we may leave the territory entirely, but we have managed to maintain a foothold, for now."
krg_por_angola.4.a: "Better than nothing, I suppose..."

krg_por_angola.5.t: "Popular dissatisfaction with the Government!"
krg_por_angola.5.d: "The domestic mood has turned strongly against the government due to the unpopular war in Angola, one that we lost!\n\nAlready many people have taken to the streets, and if we do not repeal some of the war-time measures, or increase living standards somehow, they will not wait for the next election to throw us out of office! They may even do so literally!"
krg_por_angola.5.a: "Cancel the conscription"
krg_por_angola.5.b: "Increase subsidies, we'll find the money later!"

krg_por_angola.6.t: "Coup d'État!"
krg_por_angola.6.d: "The dissatisfaction of the Army with the conduct of the war in Angola would perhaps not have been of consequence if we had at least arranged a negotiated solution. Instead we lost both their support and that of the natives.\n\nNow the government has been replaced by the army, with the former Military Governor of Angola Horácio José de Sá Viana Rebelo leading the 'Junta for National Salvation' until a new election can be held."
krg_por_angola.6.a: "Oh my!"

krg_por_angola.7.t: "The Retornados Start to Arrive in Lisbon"
krg_por_angola.7.d: "After travelling for several weeks on ships in the Atlantic, the first wave of Angolan Colonists who fled the takeover of the colony have arrived in Lisboa. Battered, beaten and weary, they still found time to express their anguish at their misfortune.\n\nSeveral on the far right wing have sought to court the retornados, while the newspapers reported a shock due to having to absorb such a number of refugees so quickly, that some were found sleeping in the streets and camping out in the squares of Lisboa."
krg_por_angola.7.a: "How dreadful"

krg_por_angola_news.1.t: "Portugal flees Angola!"
krg_por_angola_news.1.d: "Unable to maintain their war footing in the vast colony or come to a negotiated settlement with the Angolan rebel movements, the Portuguese Republic has had to formally withdraw from the territory of the newly declared state of Angola, under the leadership of the LNA, an organisation with close ties to the AAPM that toppled Mittelafrika.\n\nWhat the future of the former colony holds is uncertain, but a significant number of colonists have already fled the territory, fearful of reprisals."
krg_por_angola_news.1.a: "Oh my!"

krg_por_angola_news.2.t: "Coup d'État in Portugal!"
krg_por_angola_news.2.d: "The dissatisfaction of the Portuguese Army with the conduct of the war in Angola and the loss of the territory has caused them to overthrow the Portuguese Government.\n\nGeneral Horácio José de Sá Viana Rebelo, himself having returned from Angola recently, plans to lead a 'Junta of National Salvation' until elections can be held.\n\nThe question of whether or not Portugal will continue to fight for her other overseas territories was not discussed, but one must wonder what the future holds. Already there are rumblings in Portuguese East Africa from the events in Angola."
krg_por_angola_news.2.a: "Goodness!"
