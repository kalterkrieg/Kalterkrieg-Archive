### STATE IDEAS ###
###################

#######################################
### Pacific States of America (CAL) ###
#######################################
CAL_west_coast_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YWest Coast§!', a geographic area consisting of states along the Pacific coast of America and interior areas closely culturally, geographically, and politically aligned to this region. These states typically have a rather diverse economic situation, with some regions being connected to extraction and resource-based economies while others are heavily industrialized and even have begun to enter a post-industrial economy. What these states have in common is a strong sense of prosperity, as the Second American Civil War largely passed them over beyond a few minor §RSyndicalist§! and pro-§CFederalist§! uprisings, resulting in their becoming the center of a massive wartime economic boom as production ramped up. Politically, these states are largely split between §Osocial§! and §Imarket§! §Yliberalism§! with the £GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §OProgressive Party§! typically dominant, with smaller factions ranging from §Rsocialists§! to §Bconservatives§! holding minor amounts of power."

CAL_southwest_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YSouthwest§!', a geographic area consisting of states along the §GMexican§! border in the Southern part of the United States. These states' economies are largely based on resource and mineral extraction, as large amounts of copper and other minerals are available beneath their surface. Culturally, these states maintain strong Hispanic populations and cultural ties, with their populations often having significant amounts of ancestry tied to §GMexico§! or the Spanish settlement. There are also large Native American reservations in this region, the largest being the §YNavajo§! peoples of Arizona and New Mexico, whose influence can be seen at every level of the region. Politically, these states remain politically §Ymoderate§!, their governments mostly influenced by the ruling parties and movements in their country with a unique §YSouthwestern§! spin."

CAL_rocky_mtn_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YRocky Mountains§!', a geographic area consisting of states along the titular §YRocky Mountains§! in the Western part of America. These states are typically dependent on extraction economies, with mineral resources, agriculture, and forestry being abundant. They are also considered prime tourist destinations, at least, in times when they weren't the border of an internal divide within America. These states are typically sparsely populated outside of a few major cities, with refugee communities contributing to their settlement but not altering this pattern extensively. Politically, these states are strongly impacted by the situation they find themselves in, with some of these states adhering to strict §Sprogressivism§! while other ones have moved towards §Bconservatism§! in response to their division and militarization."

CAL_pacific_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YPacific§!', a geographic area consisting of states detached from the mainland of America. These states are only two, §YAlaska§! and §YHawaii§!, whose shared situation mostly consists of their mutual history following the beginning of the Second American Civil War and little else. Both of these, after the war began, were removed from the United States and her successor factions (§YAlaska§! by being placed under the protection of §ACanada§!, §YHawaii§! by the intervention of the §LJapanese§! and later formation of the §YHawaiian Mandate§!) and only recently returned. Economically, they have little in common, §YAlaska§! mostly serving as a resource-extraction economy while §YHawaii§!'s economy is dependent on tourism and agriculture. Politically, these states are still getting used to their status as part of America once more, and as a result are fairly politically §Yvolatile§!."

utah_mormon_church: "The Mormon Church"
utah_mormon_church_2: "The Mormon Church"
utah_mormon_church_desc: "Rather than a political or social group, Utahn politics is best defined through a single religious organization: the §YChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints§!, commonly referred to as the LDS Church or Mormon Church. Founded by Joseph Smith in 1830, the early church was defined by a series of conflicts with both religious authorities and settler groups which forced it to undertake a series of migrations towards the Western frontier of the United States. Colonizing much of the territory that would become Utah, as well as parts of Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, and Nevada, the church entrenched itself as a political entity by effectively governing the region despite a series of conflicts with the United States Government.\n\nWhile the church initially nominally backed §CFederalist§! forces during the Second American Civil War, due to the use of Salt Lake City as a primary staging area, church leaders would later come to back the §YPacific States§!, resulting in the state rapidly coming under their control. This agreement now forms the backbone of Utah's current existence, with the church being allowed to conduct its activities mostly uncontested in exchange for not opposing the use of the state as a linchpin for the defense of the Rocky Mountains. While the church remains politically neutral, its members have often taken strict stances on various topics ranging from social welfare to the Civil Rights Movement, resulting in an unusual political situation where all parties ranging from the furthest-§Rleft§! £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialists§! and furthest-§Bright§! £GFX_USA_democrats_texticon §BDemocrats§! alike attempt to court the church's good graces.\n\n§YUtah will be generally supportive of general welfare and societal aid reform policies while opposing policies which are seen as harming the moral character of the church or society.§!"

california_hollywood: "Hollywood\n\n£GFX_USA_progressive_texticon §YProgressive Popularity:§! §G+5%§!\n\n£GFX_USA_republicans_texticon §YRepublican Popularity:§! §G+5%§!\n\nStability: §G+5.00%§!"
california_hollywood2: "Hollywood"
california_hollywood_desc: "The presence of the movie industry in Hollywood has a huge impact on our nation and politics. In addition to projecting our culture around the globe, the cinema industry has understood its important civic role in supporting liberalism in the Pacific States. Understanding that the freedoms of speech and of the press will be greatly curtailed should the Pacific States fall, their support of our government and political liberalism has been an incredible boon to our government."

#########################
### New England (NEE) ###
#########################
NEE_new_england_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YNew England§!' region, a geographic area consisting of states in the Northeast of America. These states have a strong socio-political identity of their own, forming the core of the present §YNew English§! state which was created by a union of governors following the Second American Civil War. Economically, these states are highly developed, owing to their long history as a center of innovation and progression from the earliest days of English settlement in the Americas. This has resulted in their shared economy being built on industry, shipping, and business in a way that few other regions can boast. Politically, these states maintain a strong §Yliberal§! tradition, with both the old £GFX_USA_republicans_texticon §IRepublican§! and £GFX_USA_democrats_texticon §BDemocratic§! parties continuing to exist mostly in their pre-Civil War states despite challenges from the resurgent §Sprogressive§! movement in the area."

##################################
### AMERICAN UNION STATE (TEX) ###
##################################
TEX_upper_south_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YUpper South§!', a geographic area consisting of states outside of the 'Deep South' but largely considered to be part of the South. While these states often have strong agricultural economies, they do not produce cotton so much as other crops, and often have more relatively small farms compared to the Deep South. They also tend to be more mountainous, with sharper divisions between sub-regions, and often have strong logging and/or mining industries contributing to a more economically diverse situation. These states are often culturally similar to one another, though where the §YUpper South§! ends and other regions begin can be hard to identify on the fringes, as it acts as more of a border region than others in the United States. The §YUpper South§!, politically, has §Ylittle general trend§!, state-level politics holding primacy over regional politics which can range from §Sprogressivism§! to §gLongism§! to §Bconservatism§! depending on the specifics of the state in question."

TEX_deep_south_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YDeep South§!', a geographic area consisting of states considered to be a core part of the Southern region of the United States. These states have very strong agriculturally-based economies, often being called the 'Cotton States' due to their primary crop, which has assisted in the development of deep social stratification in the region. The most obvious example of this stratification is the '§YBlack Belt§!', a band of counties which have 30% or more African-American populations, which are often the most impoverished in the region if not the entire country. Apart from this, these states are often politically §Bsocially conservative§! due to the established political classes of the region, though more §Sprogressive§! movements have begun to make their discontent heard as the region enters the postwar."

TEX_mid_atlantic_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YMid-Atlantic§!', a geographic area consisting of states above the South but below the area largely considered to be New England. These states derive a significant amount of their economy from their industrial base and shipping, which can be seen in how their populations are more typically centered around major metropolitan areas and sparsely populated in rural ones when compared to their Southern or Midwestern counterparts. These states tend to be more politically varied than other states, with urban areas feeling the lasting impact of the §RCombined Syndicates§! in their continued support for §Sprogressive§! movements while rural areas are more §Bconservative§! in their politics, making knowing how the region will go on any specific issue a difficult exercise."

TEX_great_lakes_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YGreat Lakes§!', a geographic area consisting of states in and around the five Great Lakes of North America. These states have some of the most established industrial and commercial bases in the world, even despite their extensive damage in the fighting of the Second American Civil War, with most of their economy coming from their production and exportation of commercial goods. Culturally, these states are melting pots even moreso than other regions, with various groups ranging from Central and Eastern European migrants, African-Americans, and more meeting in this nexus of industry. Because of this and its status as the heart of the former §RCombined Syndicates§!, the §YGreat Lakes§! trends strongly towards §Sprogressive§! politics (particularly labor union politics), an issue prevalent in their interactions with other regions."

TEX_central_plains_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YCentral Plains§!', a geographic area consisting of states in the center of the continent whose terrain is often extremely flat. These states are heavily agricultural, having benefited from the mechanization of agriculture that occurred before the Second American Civil War, though their states became heavy battlegrounds between primarily §CFederalist§! and §gUnion State§! forces during the later parts of the war. These states often are populated by the descendants of European immigrants having arrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, resulting in pockets of regional subcultures as well as the occasional area that maintains a non-English speaking majority. Politically, these states are often politically §Yagrarian populist§!, which can range from §Bconservative populism§! to the sorts of §Sprogressive populism§! that swept the country in the early 1900s."

TEX_gulf_coast_desc: "This state is best described as a member of the '§YGulf Coast§!', a geographic area consisting of states surrounding the §YGulf of Mexico§! on the Southern edge of the United States. While this is not a geographic region in the traditional sense, as all states in this region have distinct cultures and histories separate from one another, the region does share some characteristics such as a heavy emphasis on coastal economies such as fishing and petrochemical extraction and a humid subtropical climate that typifies the region. These states are populated by a number of cultural and linguistic groups stretching back to French and Spanish colonization, resulting in somewhat unique naming and political conventions in these states. Politically, these states have become closely tied to the sort of politics emphasized by §gLongism§!, with §Bconservative§! groups maintaining a degree of presence."

#Political Ideas#
TEX_heart_of_american_socialism: "Heart of American Socialism\n£GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive Popularity:§! §G+10%§!"
TEX_heart_of_american_socialism_desc: "This state is a member of a small collection of states which formed the core of the former §RCombined Syndicates of America§! and who housed the strongest support for the £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialist Party of America§! before the Second American Civil War. While the §RCombined Syndicates§! and the £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialist Party§! are gone, existing only in memory and occasionally in the actions of small bands of diehard guerrillas, the politics they left behind are not. These states, despite attempts by New Orleans at De-Syndicalization through barring former §RCombined Syndicates§! and especially £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialist Party§! officials from holding office and restricting party politics, remain firmly under the control of the £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive§! faction of the £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gAmerica First Party§!. This is, in part, a compromise to placate the left-leaning populations of these states and prevent uprisings like in Appalachia. However, it is also an understanding of the situation on the ground, as labor unions and organizations established before and during the Second American Civil War still hold significant sway.\n\n§YThis state is likely to maintain a§! £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive§! §Ygovernment, unless something drastic or unusual occurs, and they will support pro-union and generally left-wing political actions.§!"

#Segregation Ideas#
TEX_contested_segregation_desc: "For reasons depending on specific circumstance, this state has longstanding segregation laws that are presently being contested at various levels. While this is rare for 1948, only occurring in §SSid McMath§!'s Arkansas, it is inevitable that even under the American Union State's unusual relation with segregationism attempts to challenge these laws will be made. The level of success in this regard depends on a variety of decisions made at the different levels of government, but the simple act of them being challenged is an advance from what has been in several states.\n\n§YThis state is more likely to be a volatile region for the issue of civil rights.§!"

#Socio-Economic Ideas#
TEX_prospering_agri_region_desc: "This state is an agricultural region that has made it through the Second American Civil War largely untouched, resulting in it being noted for having a relatively prosperous economy and a generally stable state government when compared to other, more impacted regions. Farms continue their mechanization largely unabated despite wartime shortages, farmers continue to prosper, and fields come to harvest with increasing yields every year. Because of this situation, so long as the economy of this state continues to grow, this state will be in favor of a continued status quo when it comes to considering new leadership for state and national rule.\n\n§YThis perspective will make it harder for challengers to contest incumbents in this state.§!"

#Unique Ideas#
TEX_mc_maths_stronghold: "McMath's Stronghold\n£GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive Popularity:§! §G+10%§!"
TEX_mc_maths_stronghold2: "McMath's Stronghold"
TEX_mc_maths_stronghold_desc: "The state of Arkansas is now §SSid McMath§!'s fiefdom, and few in Arkansas would want that to change. Having won a surprise upset election against the incumbent conservative government due to their perceived indifference towards the citizens of Arkansas, §SMcMath§!'s rapid reforms and populist rhetoric (as well as status as a war hero) has won him many friends in the state. Due to this, it is extremely unlikely that he will be unseated, and Arkansas politics will be dominated by the £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive§! faction unless something drastic or unusual occurs."

virginia_byrd_machine: "The Byrd Organization\n£GFX_TEX_afp_con_texticon §BConservative Popularity:§! §G+40%§!"
virginia_byrd_machine2: "The Byrd Organization"
virginia_byrd_machine_desc: "The §YByrd Organization§! (or §YByrd Machine§!, as it is sometimes called) refers to the system of politics which has dominated the state of Virginia since the 1890s. While the §YMachine§! was originally controlled by the state's £GFX_USA_democrats_texticon §BDemocratic Party§!, the Second American Civil War would see the destruction of the old party system, forcing the machine to adapt or die. Adapt it would, under the direction of §BSenator Harry F. Byrd Sr.§! (for whom the §YOrganization§! is named), who would lead the majority of the state's £GFX_USA_democrats_texticon §BDemocratic§! politicians into the waiting arms of the £GFX_TEX_afp_con_texticon §BConservative Faction§! of the £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gAmerica First Party§! during the war. For practically handing Huey Long the state (although Northern Virginia and Norfolk would be the scene of violence between §CFederalists§! and §gLongists§!, and the West of the state at times was held by the §RCombined Syndicates§!), the §YByrd Organization§! would be allowed to operate unfettered, gaining a stranglehold on state politics with the tacit approval of New Orleans. \n\nNow led by both §BSenator Harry F. Byrd Sr.§! and his son, §BGovernor Harry F. Byrd Jr.§!, the §YOrganization§! ensures that no politicians can gain office without the approval of the both of them. This, in turn, gives them near total control over the legislature, state bureaucracy, and even the top positions. As a result, any politician needs to at least give tacit support to the §YOrganization§!, broadly under the £GFX_TEX_afp_con_texticon §BConservative Faction§! in order to be elected in Virginia."

west_virginia_mountaintop_insurgency: "The Mountaintop Insurgency\n§RThis State is a Demilitarized Zone§!\n§SProgressive Popularity:§! §G+20%§!\n§WState§! £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressives§! §Wmay hold§! £GFX_USA_spa_texticon §RSocialist§! §WSympathies§!"
west_virginia_mountaintop_insurgency2: "The Mountaintop Insurgency"
west_virginia_mountaintop_insurgency_desc: "Despite the defeat of the §RCombined Syndicates of America§! in the Second American Civil War, not all of the regime's members went quietly. While most groups of guerrillas and militias eventually surrendered or were defeated by a combination of professional and Minutemen forces, the most fanatical followers of the §RSyndicalist§! cause fled to the mountains of Appalachia. Here, they continue a low-level insurgency against the Union State government, preventing any codification of their rule outside of major urban centers and primary transport links. In some rural areas, they are even able to assert their authority somewhat openly, holding trials and conducting 'people's justice' in areas in which they have not been eliminated or which are not policed stringently enough. Furthermore, many state politicians of the £GFX_TEX_afp_prog_texticon §SProgressive§! faction are rumored to be at least sympathetic to the guerrillas, hampering national efforts to eliminate them. This, combined with the issue of New Orleans not wishing to appear wanton or callous in its destruction (as civilians are often caught in the crossfire), means that barring future action, the situation remains stalemated.\n\n§RUntil this problem is resolved, our hold over West Virginia and the broader Appalachian region will be tenuous at best and contested at worst.§!"

louisiana_birthplace_of_longism: "The Birthplace of Longism\n£GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gOrthodox Popularity:§! §G+25%§!"
louisiana_birthplace_of_longism2: "The Birthplace of Longism"
louisiana_birthplace_of_longism_desc: "The State of Louisiana holds a special place in the zeitgeist of the American Union State, being the home of its late founder, §gHuey Pierce Long§!, the home of the core of its national leadership under §gEarl Kemp Long§!, and its current capital. It is no surprise, then, that the state which birthed the £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gAmerica First Party§! is now the strongest home of its politics. Originally run by a series of politicians from the pre-Second American Civil War £GFX_USA_democrats_texticon §BDemocratic Party§!, the state would be swept up by both §gHuey Long§! and his £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gAmerica First Party§!, becoming the first state in a series (and later, all those under the American Union State) to elect candidates on the America First slate. With §gLong's§! governorship came the radical restructuring of the state, with sweeping reform programs and an intricate system of patronage transforming the state into almost a personal extension of his politics.\n\nThis would not end under the Presidential administration of both himself and his brother, §gEarl Long§!, with the eldest brother of the three, §gGeorge Shannon Long§!, maintaining the state governorship while the two others served as consecutive Presidents of their new nation. Today, it is almost impossible to imagine Louisiana politics without the §gLongs§!, a fact that the current administration is keen to keep true. Without their approval, it is unlikely any faction not supported by the §gLongs§! represented by the £GFX_TEX_afp_texticon §gOrthodox Faction§! will achieve any prominent office in the state."

#Divided State#
TEX_divided_state: "Divided State"
TEX_divided_state_desc: "When the §YSecond American Civil War§! first began, few believed that the consequences would result in their state being divided. However, such is the case with §Y[KRGStateGetShortName]§!, as its people are now separated between the different powers of the former America and its existence as a unified political body has come to an end. Rival political governments have been set up in the state, often with one in its de jure capital and another in the largest or most defendable city on the other side of the border. While the population split can be nearly equal or miniscule, the fact that the state is divided plays heavily into its politics, as refugees and revanchists alike seek the unification of this state. In addition, this state's placement on the border with a rival government gives it a different insight on politics than its more interior counterparts, with the division of America right on its doorstep instead of being a more theoretical affair.\n\n§YPolitics which support the unification of this state and America as a whole, as well as politics supporting the defense of this state by military or diplomatic measures, will be considered favorably by this state.§!"

#Three Governors#
georgia_three_governors: "The Three Governors"
georgia_three_governors_desc: "In the 1946 gubernatorial election in Georgia, a political crisis began as the Governor-Elect, §BEugene Talmadge§!, sadly passed away causing a vacancy in the position. His son, instead, opted to claim that he was the rightful Governor as he had essentially ran his father campaign, something the General Assembly of Georgia agreed upon and chose to elect him to become the next Governor instead. Both the lieutenant governor-elect, §gMelvin E. Thompson§!, and the main opponent to Mr. Talmadge, §SEllis Arnall§!, argued that such was a violation of the State Constitution and opted to vote against the decision in the General Assembly as well as call upon the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Supreme Court ruled that the General Assembly had violated the law, stating that the Constitution is clear that §gMr. Thompson§! should become Governor and that a special gubernatorial election should be held in 1948.\n\nDespite the clear ruling of the Supreme Court, all of those involved feel a certain untrust towards each other and all wish to secure the position of Governor..."

Perhaps, it is there he decided to bring it upon himself to further his views of equality.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the Rocky Mountain Ceasefire, Sid McMath, like many other Americans, rejoiced. He returned to his Great State of Arkansas, and saw what the ruins of the Civil War had done to it and decided to run for office.
