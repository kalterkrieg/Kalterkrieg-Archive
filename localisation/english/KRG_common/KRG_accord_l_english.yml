ent_dip.1.t: "SHAPE Presents Plans for 1951 Naval Exercises"
ent_dip.1.d: "Action taken within the Accord's military command structure known as SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Accord Powers Europe) has led to the announcement of a new naval exercise in an undecided location to better prepare the Grand Fleet and increase coordination between the nations of the Accord. Top Admiralty has two suggestions for the location of the exercises.\n\nSeveral naval analytics and admirals suggest the exercise should be in the North Sea, a likely zone of conflict should war with the Reichspakt ever arise. Admiral Bruce Fraser suggests the world and the Germans most of all, need a reminder that Britannia rules the waves once more. \n\nThe opponents headed by Admiral Sir Wilfred Patterson, are quick to point out that action so close to Germany would be seen as a direct threat to German Security and would spark a crisis between the Reichspakt and the Accord. It would force the Accord to possibly risk war or back down which would only empower Germany in the region and in the eyes of the world. They believe the open waters of the Atlantic will prove best fit for fulfilling the goals of the Admiralty and SHAPE of testing the readiness of the Royal Navy and the Accord."
ent_dip.1.a: "The North Atlantic"
ent_dip.1.b: "The North Sea"

ent_dip.2.t: "SHAPE Selects North Atlantic for Naval Exercises"
ent_dip.2.d: "Through heavy debate, SHAPE has chosen the open waters of the Atlantic to perform the planned 1951 Accord Joint Naval Exercises. Under Admiral Sir Wilfred Patterson, the Accord's Combined Strike Fleet will undergo a series of tests to determine the readiness and coordination between the Accord. A non-interference zone has been declared in the North Atlantic where the navy operation is set to take place. All ships not part of the operation will be redirected upon contact with the fleet. Already Germany, Russia, and the Danubian Federation have agreed to respect the zone."
ent_dip.2.a: "An excellent choice"

ent_dip.3.t: "The Beginning of Exercise Mainbrace"
ent_dip.3.d: "With the collective fleet of the Accord finally in position. Admiral Wilfred Patterson, head of the operation, has given the green light to begin the exercises including a series of tests for the communication and organization between the different nations participating. The first test includes a surprise attack in which a combined strike force including naval aircraft and ships commits a strike against the center of the fleet to knock out the fleet's carriers and achieve air superiority.\n\nThe second test consists of a u-boat submarine wolfpack ambush against the fleet acting as if it were protecting a convoy. The German submarine tactics were watched in great detail by the Entente and the later Accord to protect its shipping in case of future conflict. The final test was for in the case of a Third Weltkrieg, how quickly the combined fleet response time as well as communication efficiency."
ent_dip.3.a: "Lets see what our navy can do!"

ent_dip.4.t: "SHAPE begins Carrier Strike Exercises"
ent_dip.4.d: "The first set of combat exercises consists of a three-day-long combat scenario between the participating Canadian Fleet against the French and International Participants. The trials will consist of a series of attacks and counterattacks using naval aircraft launched from aircraft carriers. The aircraft have been briefed on their mission to fly in coordination with a mixture of supporting fighters alongside naval bombers using both torpedos and bombs to knock out enemy capital ships while also preventing the loss of their own capital ships. Wilfred Patterson will be commanding the Canadian fleet while Emile Muselier will command the international fleet.\n\nAt the start of the exercises, the international fleet spotted the Canadians first but poor communication between the different national ships caused miscommunication. By the time aircraft were deployed, the Canadians had spotted the international fleet and deployed aircraft. After several hours, the battle was clearly won by the Canadians. The second day went similarly to the first, however, at the midpoint of the battle, a sortie of French NAME naval bombers successfully broke through Canadian AA and dealt a serious blow to the fleet by knocking out the carrier HMCS Magnificent along with her two supporting cruisers.\n\nThe third and final day proved to be a pitched battle with each of the fleets learning the best counter the enemy's air attacks. Bomber aircraft losses were high with neither scoring a decisive hit.The experience gained from the exercises has proven useful with each side preparing for the air attack exercises for the following days."
ent_dip.4.a: "Bombs away!"

ent_dip.5.t: "SHAPE begins Naval Air Attack Exercises"
ent_dip.5.d: "For the next set of exercises over the course of the coming days, the Accord Fleet has been ordered to exercise the use of naval bombers against land targets. Many pivotal moments in the Second Weltkrieg came from the use of air supremacy by sea to aid in invading Canadian troops on the isles of Britain. The Entente's successful use of tactical and strategic bombing won the war in many of the Accord's eyes.\n\nSHAPE has kept priority on this objective of Sea-Based Air Supremecy in case of any war on mainland Europe. While lots of work has been done since the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the British home islands are still in need of support from the Royal Navy in order to defend her sovereignty. For the exercises, several old cruisers and freighters will act as targets for bombing runs performed by both French and Canadian aircraft. Several fighter sorties and two frigates have been assigned as defensive forces to combat the bombers during the exercises."
ent_dip.5.a: "Shoot em down!"

ent_dip.6.t: "SHAPE Begins Anti-Submarine Exercises"
ent_dip.6.d: "With the recent completion of the naval-air attack exercises, the admiralty has assigned for the last few days possibly the most important exercises of the entire operation. Since the end of the Second Weltkrieg, Canada and her allies have taken special attention to anti-submarine warfare after watching the Germans extensively use a submarine fleet to siege the British Syndicalist and isolate the European front from the global international. Not only does the Accord view the submarines as a conventional threat, but with the dawn of the nuclear age, it has been considered that a submarine may be able to launch short-range ballistic missiles from only a few miles off the coast of their enemy leading to concern that even Canada, long protected by the Atlantic, is no longer out of the Kaiser's reach.\n\nFor the exercises, the fleet will be divided into several patrols to help organize an efficient hunter-killer group specifically for the role of destroying submarine wolf-packs. The HCMS Louise will head the patrol of destroyers and frigates with specified ASW equipment including advanced sonar, depth charges, and mortars. While no Accord submarines are active in the area, the captain of the HCMS Louise will be notified at random times when a submarine is detected to allow for testing regarding the ability and preparedness of the fleet to combat enemy submarines. With the end of the exercises nearing, many at SHAPE already are considering the operation a great success and a press release on the achievements of the operation is to be made public in a week."
ent_dip.6.a: "Those U-boats better watch out!"

ent_dip.7.t: "HMCS Louise spots an unidentified submarine during exercises"
ent_dip.7.d: "During the recent anti-submarine exercise, the MCMS Louise's sonar detected an anomaly and upon further investigation believe to be a submarine lurking outside of the restricted zone most likely performing surveillance on the exercises. The flagship carrier, HMS Eagle, radioed to order the submarine to leave the area at once and report any updates on the current situation. Admiral Wilfred Patterson canceled the next day's exercises and placed the fleet on alert until the submarine leaves. While no evidence has been found, it is already rumored the submarine is the Germans. Several captains point out it might not be alone and instead, the fleet could be surrounded by one of the German wolfpacks."
ent_dip.7.a: ""Attention submarine, this is a restricted area, leave immediately""

ent_dip.8.t: "The Accord Begins Naval Exercises in the Atlantic"
ent_dip.8.d: "Despite the Accord being assured that their operation in the North Atlantic would be respected, the Kaiser has already gathered the Admiralty over discussion on how to approach the Accord's operation in the Atlantic. While most of the German population and the German government are disinterested in the operation in the Atlantic, the Kaiser is keen to personally know the actions of the Accord's fleet. He believes Germany rose to its place in the Sun through the might of its High Seas Fleet and that the British contesting naval supremacy in the open waters of the Atlantic is a direct threat to the security of his empire. Despite the assurances of several admirals that the Accord poses no offensive threat, several opposers suggest this is an opportunity for Germany to gain valuable information surrounding the coordination of the Accord's Atlantic Fleet."
ent_dip.8.a: "Send a submarine to monitor them"
ent_dip.8.b: "Let them have their fun"

ent_dip.9.t: "The Accord Orders our Submarine to Leave"
ent_dip.9.d: "After several days of observing, the Accord detected our submarine. They must've spotted us on their sonar by coincidence during their anti-submarine trials. The Accord must have already assumed our mission was gathering intel, however without knowing our nationality, they may be less inclined to use force against us. The Accord has been assured that Germany will respect their restricted zone, and their radio transmission demanding we leave gives no list of repercussions if we stay. Despite this, our orders from the Admiralty were to leave if contacted by the Accord to avoid any risk of sparking a crisis."
ent_dip.9.a: "We will continue to observe them"
ent_dip.9.b: "Our orders were to depart if challenged"

ent_dip.10.t: "Mystery sub doesn't leave"
ent_dip.10.d: "Despite our demands, the submarine has remained in the restricted zone, and we haven't received any messages from them. It is clear that they intend on continuing to observe our operation and with a day already wasted waiting, Admiral Wilfred Patterson has gathered several captains to determine a strategy to drive off the submarine. Reflecting on the recent anti-submarine exercise, an idea to use signal charges to annoy the submarine and force it to leave has been developed.The signal charges release pinging noises loud enough to drive an entire submarine crew mad. The HCMS Louise will approach the submarine and start dropping the charges while continuing to radio it to leave at once.\n\nWhile most captains agree with the previous plan, a few opponents believe it is unnecessarily aggressive and a less risky option is available. Several ASW aircraft are still armed and ready from yesterday's exercises, they could be deployed allowing us to keep the submarine where we want to while continuing our exercises."
ent_dip.10.a: "Drive them off with signal charges"
ent_dip.10.b: "Harass them with sonar pings"
ent_dip.10.c: "Have ASW aircraft shadow them for the rest of the exercise"

ent_dip.11.t: "The Accord Navy drops signal charges"
ent_dip.11.d: "The Accord has apparently grown tired of our silence and deployed a destroyer to force us to leave or surface with signal charges. The crew is already growing restless of the noise, and it is clear we can't stay here. We can stay submerged and attempt to flee, but the destroyer may not even let us get that far and switch to real depth charges. The batteries are low and if they chose to give chase, escape will be nearly impossible. Meanwhile surfacing would expose our mission and would immediately cause upheaval between Germany and the Accord."
ent_dip.11.a: "Surface at once!"
ent_dip.11.b: "Withdraw"

ent_dip.12.t: "Our Submarine has been detected; Accord might be getting ready to attack us!"
ent_dip.12.d: ""
ent_dip.12.a: "Launch torpedoes"
ent_dip.12.b: "They wouldn't dare"

ent_dip.13.t: "Our Submarine is being shadowed by Accord aircraft"
ent_dip.13.d: "The Accord has deployed an ASW aircraft to shadow us. It seems they have no intent on leaving and aren't going to allow us to observe any more of their exercises. With our mission complete, Berlin has radioed us to return with our intel to report on the status of the Accord's Atlantic fleet."
ent_dip.13.a: "Withdraw"

ent_dip.14.t: "The unidentified sub attacks! It's the Germans!"
ent_dip.14.d: "At 08:30, the mystery sub fired torpedoes at the HCMS Louise, who narrowly escaped being struck. The crew immediately returned fire using mortar-propelled depth charges and radioed in the attack. While this was ongoing, the sub sent out a call for help which was immediately recognized as German. By 10:30, the Louise had cornered the U-Boat with the aid of two River Class Frigates and fired off several depth charges. A few minutes after the explosions, a large oil spill covered the surface. Shortly after the reported sinking of the U-boat and full coverage of the event by the BBC, the Germans sent forward an ultimatum stating unless met, there would be war."
ent_dip.14.a: "Don’t bother replying"

ent_dip.15.t: "Our intelligence gathering mission is over"
ent_dip.15.d: ""
ent_dip.15.a: "Withdraw"

ent_dip.16.t: "SHAPE Selects the North Sea for Naval Exercises"
ent_dip.16.d: "By recent decision by the Admiralty of the Royal Navy, the North Sea has been chosen as the location for the upcoming Naval Exercise to determine the readiness and strength of the Accord's combined Atlantic fleet and the coordination between the countries of the alliance. While some of the admiralty were concerned with the close proximity to Germany, a show of force in the region despite the risk was seen to be determining factor in the decision. The participating fleets have been informed and are beginning the voyage to the training zone. The Canadian Government will release a special press release announcing the exercise with its goals and intentions. The BBC will also have a weeklong coverage of the exercise to keep the world updated with its progress."
ent_dip.16.a: "An excellent choice!"

ent_dip.17.t: "Accord Exercises in the North Sea"
ent_dip.17.d: "News from Ottawa, the Accord is in the North Sea! Just a few minutes ago, the Canadian Government announced its intentions along with its allies to commit a naval exercise in the North Sea. The press release states, "Our goals for this operation is to assess the readiness and capability of our alliance on the sea... the location is of no threat to the German people and the exercises are of a defensive manner." A naval action this close to our shores is meant to be a sign of strength at our expense despite the innocence claimed by the Canadians. For the Germans to her fleet to challenge the exercises seemed likely but would bring the two alliances to the brink of war. A risk many on both sides doesn't seem worth taking.\n\nSeveral neutral countries watching the situation have called for a de-escalation of tensions and for the Germans to allow the naval exercises unopposed. They claim that the use of the North Sea should be open to the Accord as per international waters despite Germany's protests of its use being restricted to the German Navy and civilian vessels. No official response from the German Government has been released as it scrambles to decide how best to react to the situation."
ent_dip.17.b: "Unacceptable. Deploy the fleet to show our power"

ent_dip.18.t: "The German fleet will be close to Exercise Mainbrace"
ent_dip.18.d: "Information from our embassy in Berlin and scouts on the outskirt of our naval exercise have discovered the Germans have taken a keen interest in our operation and have deployed their fleet nearby. Admiral Sir Wilfred Patterson has called out that this was to be expected and that the exercise should be moved to the North Atlantic as he and his colleagues originally suggested before any mistakes are made. He insists that avoiding a crisis now will allow the Accord to disengage without losing very little face.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral Bruce Fraser has doubled down on his decision to host the exercise in the North Sea. He agrees that this was to be expected and the chance to show the cowardice of the German Fleet is at hand. He believes in driving the Germans to the brink of war will force them to back down and prove the superiority of the Accord's Naval might."
ent_dip.18.a: "Move the exercises to the North Atlantic instead"
ent_dip.18.b: "The exercise will proceed as planned"

ent_dip.19.t: "Accord Navies Demonstrating Near our Fleet"
ent_dip.19.d: "Despite the recent deployment of the German Fleet into the North Sea, the Accord has continued its Naval Operation as planned. While no accidents have been reported, both fleets remain on high alert and in close proximity to each other. Disagreement has arisen among the high admiralty within the German Navy and even reports of yelling within the Kaiser's cabinet over the looming crisis. Großadmiral Karl Donitz has repeatedly pressed the Kaiser to pull the fleet out of the North Sea at the risk of war with the Accord with Germany being seen to the world as the aggressor. Meanwhile, Admiral Erich Raeder insists that the Accord's actions have the intention to wage war against Germany and the empire needs to strike immediately."
ent_dip.19.a: "The potential for an accident is very high, withdraw the fleet"
ent_dip.19.b: "The North Sea is ours!"
ent_dip.19.c: "They mean to attack! Battle stations!"

ent_dip.20.t: "German fleet going to combat stations; enemy naval bombers in the air"
ent_dip.20.d: "Today's news from the fleet in the North Sea is reporting the German Vessels are at combat ready with several sorties of naval bombers in the air. While it is not yet clear the intention behind the increased militancy of the German Fleet, the admiralty has already called for an emergency meeting on the gravity of the situation. Admiral Sir Winfield Patterson has already personally contacted the Prime Minister asking for his approval to call off the operation. He has already begun assembling a petition amongst the SHAPE staff in charge of the North Sea Operation. Meanwhile, Admiral Bruce Fraser called for an immediate strike against the German Flagship leading the attack. The Accord's fleet has already been steered to an intercept course and crew have been called to general stations.\n\nAround the world, viewers watch in horror as the BBC films the crisis unfolding live. Many believing the third Weltkrieg has already begun has stirred panic in communities across the globe. The German Government has remained silent on the currently escalating crisis. While it is believed an emergency cabinet meeting between the Kaiser and his military advisors, no reports have been confirmed. The Danubian Government has called for an emergency mediation and immediate withdrawal from the North Sea without either a response from the Canadians or the Germans."
ent_dip.20.a: "We do not wish to risk a war, cancel the day's exercises and defuse the situation"
ent_dip.20.b: "They are preparing to attack us! Launch a strike on the German flagship"

ent_dip.21.t: "German fleet attacks!"
ent_dip.21.d: "After intense deliberation, the Kaiser gave the order on the advice of his admiralty for the High Seas Fleet to engage the Accord’s Navy within the North Sea. It was decided that the operating fleet was too large of a threat and could be preparing an immediate blockade of Germany or even a pre-emptive strike to destroy the German Navy while it sat in port leading to an effective early campaign by the Accord against Germany in a Third Weltkrieg. Already, submarines lurking in the North Sea have been told to engage when suitable, as the main fleet components steam towards the likely first battle of the Third Weltkrieg. "
ent_dip.21.a: "Remind them who rules the waves"

ent_dip.22.t: "Canadian fleet attacks!"
ent_dip.22.d: "News from the North Sea! After the deployment of the combined fleet to the North Sea, the Germans deployed the High Seas Fleet to intercept. Naval Bombers are in the air and without word from the Germans, it seems they’ve taken our actions as an act of war! With the Germans already set to engage and no reply to our radio requests for an immediate cease of action, there is no time to withdraw, Admiral Fraser has already called the fleet to general stations to prepare for action. The carrier, HMCS Magnificent, has already launched a sortie of fighters to intercept, and HCMS Louise and her Hunter Killer Force 1 are already scouting for lurking U-Boats in the area. Meanwhile, the reporting BBC crews capture live as the sailors race across decks and man their stations. While the world may not be, the Combined Atlantic Fleet is ready for war."
ent_dip.22.a: "Another Jutland??"

ent_dip.23.t: "Mystery Sub Flees"
ent_dip.23.d: "After the HCMS Louise made its first pass, the submarine immediately began to dive and withdraw. While still being picked up on sonar, it is quickly slipping away. Allowing the submarine to escape would leave the operation a success and consider the matter concluded, however, forcing the submarine is still an option.\n\nThe Louise reports that it can catch the submarine within the hour, but an aggressive approach by the destroyer may scare the submarine into retailing with force rather than surface. Capturing the sub and the crew would provide vital information as well as being a major propaganda victory for the Accord especially if it is German, but taking such an action would surely grab global attention and spark a crisis."
ent_dip.23.a: "After them!"
ent_dip.23.b: "Let them go"

ent_dip.24.t: "Accord Chases!"
ent_dip.24.d: "Despite our desperate attempts to flee, the Accord has ordered a destroyer to tail us. Its maneuvers were the same observed during the anti-submarine trials and they could be ordered to sink us! We have little choice but to surface or fire torpedoes pre-emptively. While they haven't dropped any depth charges, we can't risk them getting the chance. Launching torpedoes may be our only escape, but it would give us away and certainly spark a Third Weltkrieg. Meanwhile surfacing would throw the world into upheaval between the Reichspakt and the Accord. With our identity being revealed in either outcome, the fate of the world rests on our shoulders."
ent_dip.24.a: "We must have to surface"
ent_dip.24.b: "They mean to attack, launch torpedos!"

ent_dip.25.t: "It's the Germans!"
ent_dip.25.d: "At 08:30, the mystery submarine broke the surface and was quickly identified as one of the newest German U-boats. The HCMS Louise intercepted the U-boat and kept it 100 meters off the starboard until two more River-Class Canadian frigates arrived. Admiral Wilfred Patterson has been informed of the German U-Boat and has been presented with a unique opportunity. He believes he can capture the U-Boat and take prisoner the crew without much of a fight. However, Berlin has already been receiving messages from the U-Boat and heard of its capture. Any attempt to board or take the submarine would outrage the German government and could start the Third Weltkrieg. The captain of the HCMS Louise has already requested orders assuming to let the submarine go. The temporary capture of the German sub is already a resounding success for the Accord and with the Atlantic, Exercises to be concluded the next day, several of Patterson's advisors from during the operation have urged him to release the sub."
ent_dip.25.a: "Let them go"
ent_dip.25.b: "Hold them hostage!"

ent_dip.26.t: "It's the Germans!"

ent_dip.27.t: "The German Ultimatum"
ent_dip.27.d: "In a shockingly aggressive turn of events, Germany has not only rejected any de-escalation attempts but has issued an ultimatum to us with a list of demands including the immediate release of their submarine with its crew. With the threat of the third weltkrieg looming a decision needs to be made that may decide the fate of the world. While war is certainly on the forefront of everyone's minds, there remains an undying hope among the beleaguered populations already having faced two weltkriegs that the situation will be resolved peacefully. Germany demanded a response within twenty-four hours, and the world holds its breath as the clock slowly ticks."
ent_dip.27.a: "We have no choice, accept their demands."
ent_dip.27.b: "These are outrageous demands!"

ent_dip.28.t: "Accord Refuses!"
ent_dip.28.d: "Yesterday at 13:30 the German government issued an ultimatum to the Canadian government regarding the sparked crisis in the North Atlantic. Despite the Germans' refusal to respect the Accord's restricted zone and surveillance operation within it, Germany rejected the Canadians' demands instead replying with an ultimatum. A protest broke out in Ottowa demanding a resolution to the crisis, but after several hours the protests lost steam instead being overcome by a patriotic fever that crossed the nation after a fiery speech by the Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeaderName].\n\nIn his speech, he details the German U-Boat entering the restricted zone under orders from Berlin to conduct surveillance on the operation despite Germany's earlier promises of respecting the Accord's Naval Exercises. He ended his speech by saying Canada and her allies are determined to stand firm against Germany and remind the world that it doesn't belong to the Kaiser. With less than fifteen minutes remaining until the German Ultimatum expires, across the world, all eyes watch Germany. Several countries have already called for a summit between the two powers for immediate de-escalation but neither side has responded. It seems the world may be about to witness a third weltkrieg."
ent_dip.28.a: "We must back down now."
ent_dip.28.b: "To war we go!"
