ACW_decisions: "The Third American Civil War"
ACW_decisions_desc: "What was once utterly unthinkable has come to pass for a third time: Americans taking up arms against Americans while their shared fields and cities burn. However, it appears that both sides in this conflict are determined to make this the final conflict after the last one ended with an unsatisfying ceasefire and uneasy peace. The latest in aviation engineering, naval technology, armored spearheads, and the equipment of the reliable infantryman are being rolled out to take part in this struggle as both sides seek to achieve their final victory. In addition, militias in support of both factions, long-since dormant, are beginning to stir and rise, complicating matters further. There also remains the question of foreign involvement, as neither side is without a backer on the geopolitical stage, and a chess game beyond the battlefields of America is being waged for supremacy, as both sides know the Star-Spangled land is key to their success in that Great Game.\n\n§PForeign Involvement§!\n[CAN.GetFlag]§tCanadian Involvement§! is presently: [GetCANACWInvolvement]\n§CAccordist Involvement§! is presently: [GetAccordistACWInvolvement]\n\n[GER.GetFlag]§lGerman Involvement§! is presently: [GetGERACWInvolvement]\n§gReichspakt Involvement§! is presently: [GetReichspaktACWInvolvement]\n\n§YEscalation Potential:§!

CAL_Seize_Denver_desc: "One of the first priorities of any land invasion into the [TEX.GetNamewithFlag], the seizure of Denver will not only act as a large morale boost for our population but also serve to allow us to exert greater control over the state of Colorado and move past the Rockies with a large, well-connected transit hub. With it under our control, the journey to victory has truly begun."
CAL_Occupy_the_Rio_Grande: "Occupy the Rio Grande"
CAL_Occupy_the_Rio_Grande_desc: "Where once we were in a position to strike at the heart of Texas, we found ourselves driven back... but we have returned! Now that we control the American side of the Rio Grande, we can now fully assert ourselves in our dealings with Mexico. This will provide us more diplomatic legitimacy, secure our links with our strategic Southern partner, and may even provide men and materiel, should we be so lucky."
CAL_Mexican_Benefits: "Two £GFX_nato_unit_infantry_icon_small §YNational Guard Volunteer Regiments§! will form from American Exiles in Mexico. If we previously opened relations with Mexico, they will also provide us with an additional £GFX_nato_unit_infantry_icon_small §YNational Guard Volunteer Regiment§! from volunteers within their military."
CAL_Secure_The_Texan_Oilfields: "Secure the Texan Oilfields"
CAL_Secure_The_Texan_Oilfields_desc: "With the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas under our control, we can now exert influence and control over the State of Texas, the largest gain before our armies reach the heart of the Longist menace and the Mississippi River. Once pacification actions are complete in the state, restarting oil production should be our top priority, as having access to Texan oil to supplement our own reserves will make supplying our military for the final push. In addition, removing such a large population base from the [TEX.GetNamewithFlag] and turning it towards our own uses will only make our victory more certain."
CAL_Texan_Militias: "One £GFX_nato_unit_infantry_icon_small §YNational Guard Volunteer Regiment§! will form from loyalists, volunteers, and collaborators in §YTexas§!."

CAL_Open_the_Gateway_to_the_West_desc: "With both St. Louis and Kansas City under our control, it can definitively be said that [TEX.GetNamewithFlag] presence West of the Mississippi, if it still exists, is completely doomed. As the importance of the city of St. Louis cannot be understated, we should arrange for a series of photographs to be taken between both our own forces and those of our allies, meeting in the nominal 'Gateway to the West' in order to show the inevitable reconnection of American forces and the soon-to-come unification of our country. With these in hand, we will win a practical propaganda coup, winning support at home and showing that the final nail in the coffin of the Longist menace is soon to come."
CAL_Strike_at_the_Heart_of_Longism: "Strike at the Heart of Longism"
CAL_Strike_at_the_Heart_of_Longism_desc: "After a long and bloody campaign, we have finally seized the beating heart of the occupying force that once seemed poised to control all of America: the city of New Orleans. Our forces have had to conduct rough pacification and rooting out of remaining resistance, but finally, with Louisiana under our control, almost all of the remaining resistance in the territories still controlled by loyalists to the [TEX.GetNamewithFlag] should fall in quick succession. To bring this point home, we will march forces through the streets of New Orleans on parade, demonstrating the total and unconditional victory of Free America. Seeing our men in their finest uniforms will both serve as a celebratory gesture for those loyal to American democracy and a showing of our complete and utter victory to those still loyal to the nearly-crushed Longists."

##Events
krg_acw.0.t: "Patton proposes Operation Homecoming"
krg_acw.0.d: "Patton has sent a proposal laying out the groundwork for a semi covert military operation to the presidential desk of the Union States. It lays out strategic targets all across the Rockies that would act as both an intel-gathering operation, as well as a way to secure more strategic defensive positions, as well as better staging areas if we were to find ourselves fighting against Pacific forces.\n\nThe operation would see special forces teams secure small towns, certain counties, and strategically defensible areas within a few miles of the current borders. Elite cavalry and mountaineer regiments, after achieving their first objectives, would gather further intel on enemy defensive positions, airfields, and possible areas for future-forward operating bases. Quickly following these actions Supporting regulars and diplomatic corps teams in the meantime will be courting the newly liberated towns to our side, and do what they can to make the integration into the Union smoother. While these gains may overall seem small, they would give us a considerable advantage in the event of peace being broken. Forcing the Pacific States to abandon many of these positions would not only show the strength of our armed forces but also send reverberations to the American public.\n\nWith this plan comes significant risk, as it could potentially backfire on us and set us on a path of international humiliation if it goes awry. Even worse, it may put us on an unavoidable track to war, a war that a small minority in the general staff privately doubt we will come out victorious from. The possible benefits however could be invaluable to our forces in the event of an all-out war breaking out."
krg_acw.0.a: "It might just work.."
krg_acw.0.b: "He has gone insane!"

krg_acw.1.t: "An Incident on the Border"
krg_acw.1.d: "At approximately 1:37 AM Western time, the stillness of the American heartland was suddenly shattered as Longist infiltration forces were spotted by Pacific patrols across the Rockies. Union troops were sighted near multiple strategic positions far inland as Fort Demming in New Mexico, as well as Fort Eagle and Gunnison in Colorado. The incursion prompted swift responses across the defensive line, with local troops mobilized to expunge Union forces. Union and Pacific Troops fought for the first time since the ceasefire, with tanks, planes, and helicopters in a chorus of chaos sounding across the mountains. Union troops made quick movements, securing town after town. Within the hour, Pacific Command and National Guard units started getting pushed back to secondary positions under heavy fire.\n\nAs the initial confusion of the situation waned, a shocking revelation for the powers that be in San Francisco showed that some localities along the Rockies extended support and information to Longist forces both willingly and not, revealing key strategic points and key information about Pacific defenses along the border. By approximately 11:19 AM, the infiltration action had been largely contained, confining the Longist forces that managed to cross over to a handful of counties and towns on the Pacific side of the defensive line. The total casualty report for the incidents amounted to 87 wounded and 118 dead for the Pacific States, and 103 wounded and 62 dead for the Union State. Equipment losses also vary, with most reports being inconsistent on both sides.\n\nThe reverberations of this incident have already begun to ripple across the continent, causing a tumultuous morning from San Francisco to Boston. America's battle lines, once thought settled, may once again be in flux. Whether the seas of conflict will calm or if an ocean of war will once again sweep Old America remains uncertain. Already many overtures have been made by both sides and their allies to figure out what exactly happened."
krg_acw.1.a: "Demand a Formal Apology"
krg_acw.1.b: "We must confer with our NATO allies"
krg_acw.1.c: "Try and Extract Information from the Prisoners"

krg_acw.2.t: "The [CAL.GetName] asks for a formal apology"
krg_acw.2.d: "Following the engagements across the Rockies, our government has received diplomatic communications containing a set of demands attributing blame to us for the entire incident. The stipulations include the relinquishment of \"occupied\" counties, along with \"fair\" financial reparations and the return of prisoners, seized materials, and intel by our forces.\n\nThe majority sentiment within the government is a resolute call for the Union to stand firm, rejecting the presented demands. The advocates for this approach argue that giving concessions now would only demonstrate weakness, potentially fomenting unrest and projecting an image of vulnerability that our government would greatly wish to avoid. They believe that backing down is not an option, as it may invite further challenges and compromise the Union's position on the international stage.\n\nSome, however, are openly urging a more cautious approach and de-escalation. While the opinion seems to be far and few between, those advocating for this approach argue that the Union is ill-prepared for a prolonged conflict in the Rockies and that such a scenario could potentially draw in rivals from Boston and Detroit, as well as involve the Accord as a whole. They emphasize the potential consequences of a protracted conflict and the need to avoid external entanglements, urging a more measured response to navigate the complex diplomatic landscape lying before us.\n\nWe must decide our next course of action carefully, whether we wish to escalate the situation further, or back down while the situation remains somewhat in our favor."

krg_acw.3.d: "Despite our attempts to engage the Longists in a constructive dialogue and seek a proper and fair resolution for their aggressive actions, they have rejected all of our overtures. This has left our government grappling with a dilemma, as diplomatic avenues for peaceful resolution seem to be closing rapidly.\n\nA robust debate is underway regarding the most prudent course of action within our government. Advocates for a more assertive response propose an escalation of the situation, advocating for the mobilization of additional forces towards the Rocky Mountain Defensive Line. This includes the activation of both reserve and off-duty forces, placing our entire military apparatus on high alert to effectively counter any further Longist incursions.\n\nOn the other hand, there are proponents of a more measured and patient approach, arguing against further Military escalation. Instead, they endorse a strategy that involves the imposition of increased sanctions on the Union State and the indefinite detainment of all captured Union forces. This approach seeks to exert pressure and await a more opportune time for resolution. The decision on which path to pursue is pivotal and could either bring peace or invite war once again to America's doorstep."

krg_acw.4.d: "In response to our government's steadfast refusal to comply with the demands issued to us, The Pacific States decided to escalate the situation further by imposing another set of sanctions against us. Furthermore, they have communicated their intention to indefinitely hold some of our soldiers that they managed to capture during the Rockies Incident.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, our government is faced with a critical decision, and our General Staff is as split as ever. One option they have proposed is to maintain our current assertive posture, retaliating with our own set of sanctions against the Pacific States. This would be a continued display of resilience and refusal to bow to external pressures, asserting our sovereignty and rightful claim over the territory our troops managed to liberate and secure from the Western government.\n\nOn the other hand, a minority of our advisors say that submitting to the initial demands of the Pacific government may be a preferable option rather than escalation. The full demands as of now would involve handing over the strategic positions our troops managed to reclaim along the Rockies, as well as economic reparations and an official apology from our government, forcing us to accept total blame and responsibility for the situation as a whole. While it would defuse the situation, it would de-legitimize the capability of our government and armed forces greatly."

krg_acw.5.d: "In response to sanctions imposed by us, the American Union State reciprocated with proportional sanctions, escalating tensions. Faced with this mounting crisis, our government confronts a pivotal moment in the crisis. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have been scrambling and arguing over the next course of action to put forward to the President, and thus, have presented multiple proposals.\n\nThe first course of action entails further escalation by mobilizing reserves and elevating troop readiness. This option would possibly allow us to assert control but would bring the crisis to new heights. While confident in our military forces, they fear that a protracted conflict will quickly drain us of resources long before the Union States. It would require some of the best strategic planning our nation is capable of, with little room for error in between. Strategic planning would have to be made to the letter, and have to update already laid out plans, offensive capabilities, and defensive options. We would also have to call up all reserves immediately if we wish to even have a chance for full operational readiness in the case of war. It would also likely include a general draft to be made to make up for our lack of manpower in comparison to the Union, as well as other measures to face the tyrants in the East. It would be one of the largest ranging operations comparable to the Eastern front between the Pakt and Russians in terms of area coverage if war were to break out.\n\nAlternatively, some advocate that we can accept the new status quo, as it affords both sides a semblance of saving face while also backing out. While the positions that the Union continues to hold onto are strategic, it is overall a very small number of resources, population, and land area. The main drawback to this is that it may be perceived by hawks as backing down in the face of tyranny and possible reunification of America. Despite this, it is the plurality opinion of the staff at the moment, if ever so slightly. While not outclassed, we are certainly outgunned, and our industrial capability is not even half in most areas.\n\nTowards the last minute, however, one of our generals presented a new plan that would enable us to bring an ally into the equation. He has proposed a plan that involves inviting our brothers in New England to create a blockade against the Union. While this escalates the crisis significantly, it would leverage the situation greatly in our favor and is fairly reminiscent of the blockade against the Confederacy in the First Civil War. There is no guarantee however that they will accept, as even with our combined forces, it is still largely outclassed in terms of scale by the Union. It would however slowly choke the Longists of foreign materials, and advisors, and strangle their economy all at once. While this is an exceptional strategy, it puts all of our eggs in one basket and would leave us with no time if they were rejected. While somewhat unlikely, There is a vocal minority in New England that wishes to maintain the peace, as its Land capabilities are even smaller than ours. New England managed to dodge the most brutal aspects of the Second Civil War, and if they were to accept the proposal, could destroy all that they managed to save.\n\nWe must use the utmost judgment, lest the whole of America may burn in the fires of war once again."

Union troops initially were spotted gathering intel and attempting to seize strategic positions and towns in the Rockies, but quickly ran into resistance from local forces in the Pacific States. Soon, tanks, planes, and infantry were clashing in the mountains till just before noon the same day.

They cite that a blockade would needlessly expand the conflict across the continent, a sentiment that has taken many by surprise, particularly those with more hawkish inclinations in our government who anticipated a more favorable response. This especially came as a shock after the pledges years ago to stand together against Longist tyranny. Many in our government feel greatly betrayed by those we saw as fellow citizens, and resentment is already starting to build, likely to stem into the public once news of this reaches the news outlets.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events leaves us in an awkward position diplomatically, showing the union that whatever allies we have will be staying on the sidelines. Many within our General staff contend that we have effectively exhausted the strategic options available to us. The unfolding situation demands a delicate balance, as the success of our posturing now hinges on the hope that it is perceived as a strategic bluff by the Union, prompting them to reconsider their aggressive stance. We must now hope that they do not press their advantage and that they blink before we inevitably do. It seems clear however that we have not only been abandoned by our allies, but our credibility to defend our borders against those that would threaten liberty itself is in question.

What communique we have been able to intercept shows that many of their diplomatic overtures have failed to garner any real material or direct support.

Some of the staff are calling for us to apologize for the incident while the issue has not gotten out of hand.\n\nThe PSA's actions are also quite possibly a bluff, as reports claim that they alone do not have the military capability to stand against us.

Even with this possibility, we hold a realistic and somewhat optimistic capacity to fight and win against the ARA.

Roughly half of the delegates wish to reiterate the current demands to the Union to show a united front, but to also give the Union a way to prevent war while taking \"necessary responsibility\". The current plurality of envoys wishes to keep the current situation and not press against the Union too hard, fearing that forcing it into a corner is sure to cause a war, rather than a peaceful resolution. \n\nThe Hawks and opportunistic envoys meanwhile, wish to instead press what they see as the advantage, raising the demands against the Union by demanding more Cash payments as well as a few Strategic border counties along the border with the Pacific States.

While we seek peace, we cannot afford to look disunited and weak to this mockery of Democracy and the America of old. Thus, the delegates have agreed that not only will we reiterate that the union issue an apology for the events that had transpired, along with relinquish strategic bordering counties. The conference also decided by a slight majority that there would be a demand for an even larger reparation payment to be made to the respective American governments. These payments have also been stipulated to be in US Dollars, rather than the \"New Dollar\" they have been pushing onto their population. Lastly, a series of fortifications on the Union side of the border are to be dismantled along the border once the counties are handed over.\n\nWith these higher demands, the Union may reject the terms fully and see the only way out being full mobilization and war against Free America. However, during this time, the ARA has built up an equitable force to that of the union that makes victory a realistic prospect.  Once more, open support from other Accord nations in terms of both diplomatic overtures and material help gives us a steady supply of munitions bolstered by our burgeoning industrial capacity. Now that our demands have been sent, some delegates fear that the rejected demands will lead to war, and some of the more hawkish hope for rejection, giving the chance to reunite the America of old.\n\nNow, we must continue to prepare both our allies and observers of what glory may come, or what disaster may strike."

They have demanded a large series of payments be made to the 3 governments that make up the ARA, and that they are to be made in their US dollar, and the Union dollar is under no circumstances to be used for these payments, a clear shot at the legitimacy of our currency. It also includes a handover of strategic border counties on our side of the Rockies for the ARA to bolster their defensive positions and ensure that we are put at a distinct disadvantage in the event of \"further investigative and provocative actions\". Lastly, they wish for us to dismantle several fortifications and fortified positions after the counties are handed over.\n\nWhile these demands are quite ridiculous and insulting, we are left with limited options when considering the odds before us. While many in the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that victory is a realistic prospect given the time and effort, many are still weary of war. Accepting this would be quite humiliating for us on the international stage, and a clear blink in this high-stakes game of Chicken. While many are wary of a possible coming of war, our military capabilities have improved considerably, and may very well be able to fight the Yankees in the North and the West. Despite the advantages and disadvantages we have in the situation, the biggest concern is over whether or not the population has the will to fight another war so soon. The memory of the war lingers on the minds of many of our citizens, with the graves of their sons still fresh under the grass growing over them.

With this total rejection of the new demands, the conflict escalates again. While we can also continue the mobilization of our forces,  some of the general staff are adamant that the Union is a rogue, tyrannical, and unreasonable entity. Therefore, they push for the start of strategic air strikes along the Rockies with helicopters and strike craft.  While this would mean war, it would give us a distinct upper hand in the opening of the conflict by taking out fortifications and troops before they are fully prepared to respond.\n\nThe other camp advocating more for a peaceful resolution feels that the price of war is too great, requesting that we reverse the Detroit conference's resolution of heightened demands and go back to the original deal to give the Union a way to back out and prevent all-out war on the continent. Many of the more cautious members of the staff remember the Civil War quite well and are worried that continuously backing the beast that is the Union into a corner will risk great damage to what pieces of America we were able to preserve.

A few officers in particular seem that if they are pressured in the right areas, they are willing to see our side of the conflict as just and morally righteous. If we can turn an officer or two, they can be sent back to the Union as a possible double agent. Some in the staff feel that these actions are neither unlikely nor outright abhorrent. It is also a risk in the case of \"aggressive persuasion\" that word may get out, as scattered reports of Longest agents having eyes across the facilities their men are being held in are not unlikely. If word gets out, we could find ourselves in a very difficult international predicament. We can of course also keep them as they are indefinitely, ensuring that they will never get home, but also that the union has no possible way to respond without accepting responsibility, and ensuring that the uneasy peace remains right where it is."

Our troops made sure to not only take photographic evidence but are prepared to release this information publicly. While it would show the unwarranted actions of the PSA to the world, acknowledging that the raid took place would, in turn, give us quite a bad look along with the PSA. While it would be beneficial to expose the Pacific States, we also have a chance to get out of this without escalation of the situation.

We have assembled an elite infiltration force made of units specialized in infiltration and extraction that can get our boys back home. While their main objective is to rescue our men, they will also sabotage and scout out other areas to supplement our intelligence efforts as they return with our men. They will also seek to neutralize any enemy soldiers and positions that may hinder their chances of extraction and have been supplied with explosive charges, and an experimental transport helicopter to expedite any held men who are too wounded to be saved by traditional means. While our analysts have taken in almost all that they can account for, as well as being backed up by the most up-to-date information on the facilities Some of the General staff are against the plan, They cite that the Pacific States may have set up this entire operation to lure more of our forces into a trap. They also cite that some of this equipment is untested in the field, and would be wasting good money on untested tactics when the stakes are so high. While there are decent arguments on both sides, the window of opportunity is slowly closing, and we must decide before the window closes."
krg_acw.25.a: "It's a trap!"
krg_acw.25.b: "Attempt the Rescue."

krg_acw.26.t: "Prisoners Recovered"
krg_acw.26.d: "Our spectacular rescue effort has proven to be somewhat of a mixed. It turns out that a few of our officers that we rescued, had become agents for the government in San Francisco. It turns out the entire time they had been reintegrated into the Union, they had been relying on data from Accordite forces. In our interrogation, we were able to not only convince him to come back to the side of America and her people, but to keep relying false data to Pacific State Intelligence Services, so that he may work as a double agent, and turn the tables in our favor."
krg_acw.26.a: "Excellent!"

krg_acw.27.t: "Spy Successfully installed"
krg_acw.27.d: "We have managed to successfully get our new agent into the Union State. Our trap, despite some major hiccups, ended with the intended result. While we did not expect to sustain such heavy casualties in this, we are hoping that these efforts and sacrifices are not in vain. With our new spy in place, he will be able to rely on important information about military actions, plans, and developments on the Union Side of the border, gaining us a distinct advantage in the war of information. While some in the Staff question our new spies' loyalty, for now, he serves us, and will do so until our needs have been met, or other circumstances make him unreliable."
krg_acw.27.a: "Excellent!"

krg_acw.28.t: "Spy reveals himself"
krg_acw.28.d: "Our spectacular rescue effort has proven to be somewhat of a mixed bag for us. It turns out that a few of our officers that we rescued, had become agents for the government in San Francisco. It turns out the entire time they had been reintegrated into the Union, they had been relying on data from Accordite forces. In our interrogation, we were able to not only convince him to come back to the side of America and her people but to keep relying on false data to Pacific State Intelligence Services, so that he may work as a double agent, and turn the tables in our favor."

krg_acw.29.t: "Our spy is a double agent!"
krg_acw.29.d: " We have just discover that the plant we managed to convert from the union has been a fluke. It turns out that either he had never truly been on our side after we turned him, or that the Union managed to figure it out and remind him of his original loyalties. How long this has been taking place is uncertain, but it is plain that he has in that time, been relying false information back to our intelligence services. This humiliation of our intelligence services will likely hamper our efforts in intel gathering for the time being. In the mean time, we must cut this double agent off from all relevant information and cut all ties, god willing he doesnt find out more that we havent already given him."

krg_acw.32.t: "ARA asks again for an apology"
krg_acw.32.d: "The ARA has come to us, again reiterating that the Pacific States receive an apology for the current crisis. What makes this reiteration interesting for us is that it came after a large strategic conference took place between the ARA, as well as every member nation of the accord, and even those that wished to build up their relations with those they see as potential future partners. The Conference seems to have voted in favor of keeping the current demands, showing great international backing for their cause by the members of the Accord. While the ARA seems to be pushing this resolution as a show of reserved strength, some in the General Staff seem to think it is because they know they do not have the military capability that they are portraying.\n\nThe ARA has also stated that if we are to accept these conditions, they would in turn, demobilize their forces along with ours as a show of faith. While the terms are somewhat humiliating, there are growing concerns that we are not yet prepared for a prolonged conflict across Old America. The General Staff is keen to remind us that some of these estimates are scattered and that we will not fully know the capability unless full-scale war breaks out. "
krg_acw.32.a: "Refuse, they are bluffing."
krg_acw.32.b: "Very well."

krg_acw.33.t: "[TEX.GetName] ramps up tension"
krg_acw.33.d: "The Union State, somewhat expectantly, wholeheartedly rejected the proposals that they feel would leave them vulnerable and humiliated by our demands. This has led to a widespread mobilization order throughout the entire Union State Military. Already we have begun to see Jets scrambling and being put on high alert, known submarines and naval forces moving towards better engagement positions, and a multitude of Land forces moving towards more strategic offensive positions. With this total rejection of the new demands, the conflict escalates again. While we can also continue the mobilization of our forces,  some of the general staff are adamant that the Union is a rogue, tyrannical, and unreasonable entity. Therefore, they push for the start of strategic air strikes along the Rockies with helicopters and strike craft.\n\nWhile this would mean war, it would give us a distinct upper hand in the opening of the conflict by taking out fortifications and troops before they are fully prepared. Others in our staff feel that the price of war is too great, requesting that we reverse the Detroit conference's resolution of heightened demands and go back to the original deal to give the Union a way to back out and prevent all-out war on the continent."
krg_acw.33.a: "Continue mobilization, we must be patient."
krg_acw.33.b: "We must begin airstrikes against outposts in the Rockies."
krg_acw.33.c: "Ask for an apology and minor reparations."

krg_acw.34.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] asks us to begin airstrikes"
krg_acw.34.d: "We have received multiple reports of heavy casualties  and strategic strikes across our positions in the Rockies. Multiple Air Wings, bomber groups, and helicopters have made heavy pushes and attacks on our fortified positions and FOB's. Our forces, having been caught off guard and not at full readiness, were completely immobilized and obliterated in some areas by overwhelming firepower. These strikes are likely to be quickly followed up by offensive tactics, or serve as a delaying action for ARA forces to further fortify their positions. One thing is for certain, the peace has been broken, and it seems hard times have come again to America. Only time, strategy, and luck will see us through this Conflict. We must respond swiftly."
krg_acw.34.a: "Yes, they have taken it too far!"

krg_acw.35.t: "[CAL.GetNameDef] airstrikes Rocky border outposts"
krg_acw.35.d: "We have received multiple reports of heavy casualties and strategic strikes across our positions in the Rockies. Multiple Air Wings, bomber groups, and helicopters have made heavy pushes and attacks on our fortified positions and FOB's. Our forces, having been caught off guard and not at full readiness, were completely immobilized and obliterated in some areas by overwhelming firepower. These strikes are likely to be quickly followed up by offensive tactics or serve as a delaying action for ARA forces to further fortify their positions. Our General Staff is quickly scrambling what ready resources we have to start defensive actions, tactical retreats, and counteroffensives along the lines wherever they are applicable. One thing is for certain, the peace has been broken, and it seems hard times have come again to America. Only time, strategy, and luck will see us through this Conflict.\n\nMay God help us all."
krg_acw.35.a: "It is time for war."

krg_acw.36.t: "ARA ramps up mobilization"
krg_acw.36.d: "Recent reports have confirmed that the ARA has finally left the table, and picked up the sword. Across Accord occupied America, we have seen a large amount of strategic repositioning. Reports from our agents and scouts reveal that the ARA has not only started pushing their forces towards our border but has started to prepare factories for wartime production measures. They have also started to seek material aid from Accord-aligned nations. The mobilization efforts taking place not only match our own but combined exceed the wartime production of the Second Civil War. New Weapons, tactics, and equipment are likely to be tested and tried here and will not only the future of warfare but also America herself. Calls for accepting the concessions and demands laid before us are higher than ever, while the Hawks also call for us to officially declare war in the face of the writing on the wall that it is far too late to back out now.\n\nWe must proceed with the utmost caution."
krg_acw.36.a: "We must back down, we are surrounded."
krg_acw.36.b: "It is time for war."

krg_acw.37.t: "ARA lowers their ask"
krg_acw.37.d: "In a surprise to many in our government, the ARA has decided to lower their demands to the original demands set before us. They have taken away the clauses of Border County transfer, as well as Fortification dismantlement. Instead, they have lowered the cash payments to even less than what was originally demanded, as well as bringing back the ask for a formal apology to the Pacific Government for the incident. While this would give our government a way to save a better face than with the current agreements and ensure peace, it would still be a bit of a humiliation for our government. While the demands have lowered, many are still adamant about pressing the advantage against them, and that all of their standing is a large bluff meant to lie and deceive about how strong their forces really are. This idea is met with Skepticism, as many experts are acutely aware of some of the ARA's projected capabilities. While we still can press the advantage, many of the more wary in our government seem sympathetic to accepting the current offer a they feel this may be our last chance to keep the peace, however uneasy it may be."
krg_acw.37.a: "Refuse. We cannot back down now."
krg_acw.37.b: "Accept this offer."

krg_acw.38.t: "[TEX.GetName] refuses"
krg_acw.38.d: "Despite some of the best diplomatic efforts,  the Union State has refused to back down in the face of the ARA. Already both sides are seeing a mass mobilization of forces continue to heights that even far exceed that seen in the Civil War that ended nearly a decade earlier. From the Rockies to Lake Michigan, forces of both sides continue to build up. Every home in old America prepares for hard times again. For the third time in its history, America marches to war against itself to decide its future with blood. The land of the free will likely soon see the brave who call it home die in droves for a future they may not likely ever see. Eyes look from Berlin, London, Tokyo, and Moscow towards America as brother prepares to fight brother. Many hope for the war to end quickly, an unlikely prospect, fearing that this could pull in players that could make this game of Real Politic and Reunification fall far out of hand. The world can only watch as the lights of the once-shining city on the hill begin to dim once again."
krg_acw.38.a: "It is time for war."

krg_acw.39.t: "United Once More!"
krg_acw.39.d: "Not too long ago, the American Union State began as a twinkle in Huey Long's eye and was born amid a fiery speech from our nation's founder. His dream, however, was cut short in 1942 when the Rocky Mountain Ceasefire was signed and we officially abided the existence of corrupt rival governments on American soil. And even though he never lived to see it, Huey Long smiles on our nation from on high today as we have declared victory over our enemies once and for all! Representatives of the three defeated governments signed the unconditional surrender of the American Reclamation Alliance and now the rest of the world has no choice but to acknowledge our position as the sole and legal successor to the United States.\n\nCelebrations have been held nationwide; from Denver to New Orleans and St. Louis to Washington our citizens partied well into the night! The idea of Longism and the ideals of AFP have grown and matured since the days of Huey Long, but our brave troops have proven that his vision was the right path for America. President [TEX.GetName] gave a rousing speech from the presidential mansion thanking the troops for their sacrifice, and the American people for contributing to this victory. His popularity is higher than ever and history will likely remember him as an equal to, if not greater than Huey Long himself. Meanwhile, military police continue to pacify the cities of the north and west as we begin to fund collaborators in creating new America First Party chapters in the occupied states.\n\nReconstruction will be extensive and lengthy, and it is unlikely that the indoctrinated citizens of the occupied territories will accept Longism quickly. One thing we can do to find common ground is to reclaim the mantle of the United States. Our new government will not change, of course, but flying Old Glory and claiming we are the USA might help us find common ground with our wayward brothers and sisters. This superficial change may not rebuild their homes or return their loved ones, however. But as we assimilate their industries we can share our wealth in return and bring everyone into the fold over the next decade or so. But today we celebrate!"
krg_acw.39.a: "Under the Old Glory!"
krg_acw.39.b: "The Union State Forever!"

krg_acw.40.t: "United Once More!"
krg_acw.40.d: "With the surrender of the Longists, the United States are united once again! Spontaneous celebrations broke out across free America. Boston, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were filled with people, celebrating the end of the most horrific period in American history. The Presidents of the victorious American Reclamation Alliance met today in Washington to discuss the reunification of the United States.\n\nIn a join statement, they proclaimed the end of Longism and Syndicalism alike, and pledged that the United States would rise like phoenix from the ashes as a beacon of liberty once more. They also announced their plans for reunification. The three Presidents will continue to serve and govern their respective territories, including those liberated in the war with the Longists.\n\nElections in accordance with the US Constitution are scheduled for next November. The entire 76th Congress will be elected to their positions in that election, and take their seats on January 3rd. (The 75th Congress met for just one month in 1937 before the Civil War broke out, none of the breakaway governments numbered their Congresses in the same fashion, recognizing that America was not whole.) Per the treaty signed by the ARA signatories, each of their Congresses will sign over legislative power to the 76th Congress on the morning of January 3rd. The Presidents will continue to exercise executive power until January 20th, when the new President of the United States will be sworn in by Owen Roberts, the last surviving member of the Supreme Court from before the Civil War and arguably the man who started it all with his decision in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish. Political parties have already begun to consolidate and members of the ARA Congresses have already begun to campaign to take their seat in Washington.\n\nARA troops occupied the entire former Union State, and reconstruction has already begun. However, it will not be a short process. Having fought now two wars against the South in under a century, the ARA Presidents have pledged that this time, reconstruction will be completed."
krg_acw.40.a: "Under the Old Glory!"

krg_acw.41.t: "Formation of the Joint American Command"
krg_acw.41.d: "The Third American Civil War is unprecedented in many ways, notably the involvement of three separate allied factions. While the Pacific States, New England, and Great Lakes have utilized NATO and The Accord as tools for equipment standardization and technology sharing, the American Reclamation Alliance (ARA) is composed of three separate militaries. While our military theorists agree that the ARA tips the scales in manpower and equipment, the Union State's centralized army structure is one of its greatest advantages.\n\nTo remedy this lack of cohesion, the ARA has invoked Article IV of the Ottawa Protocols to create the Joint American Command (JAC). The JAC is the nucleus of all ARA military operations and is composed of three major departments: the Chiefs-of-Staff Committee (CSC), the Military Supply Board (MSB), and the Executive Officer Committee (XOC). The CSC is the head of the JAC and is composed of four Chief Officers: The Chairman of the Chiefs-of-Staff, Chief of Land Forces, Chief of Air Forces, and Chief of Naval Forces. Currently, the CSC equally represents New England and the Pacific States. Pacific High Command will appoint the Chiefs of Land and Air forces while the New England Navy will send one of their own as Chief of Naval Forces. Additionally, General Mark W. Clark has been appointed to the position of Chairman. The CSC coordinates with the MSB to requisition and distribute equipment from the supply chains, and then issues orders to the XOC which handles the day-to-day operation of the three branches.\n\nWhile the Great Lakes have no representative on the CSC, they are expected to manage the MSB due to their strategic position as a central supply hub for the war effort. In total, the JAC is made up of 100 officers and 300 civilian support personnel. With the JAC fully operational, our militaries now act as one unified force that will surely overcome the Longist threat once and for all!"
krg_acw.41.a: "And we'll live and die together in The Army of the Free!"

krg_acw.42.t: "The Accord Offers us Peace"
krg_acw.42.d: "With the collapse of the ARA, Canada and the Accord have come to the realization that further war in North America is pointless. They have offered us a white peace, with a return to pre-1937 borders. Canada has refused to hand over Alaska, but have left open the possibility for further negotiations over the territory in the future. War in Canada would likely be extremely difficult, despite the massive manpower and materiel advantage we have. The State Department has recommended that we accept the offer."

krg_acw.45.t: "The Union State Offers us Peace"
krg_acw.45.d: "Understanding that the American Civil War is now over with the collapse of the ARA, the Union State has offered peace and status-quo ante-bellum. It is unlikely that we will be able to restore the United States to its liberal democratic foundation. We should cut our losses and accept peace."

They have demanded that our ships turn back and head to Germany, and they want us to stop any further shipments of equipment to the AUS.

krg_acw_lend_lease.16.t: "Germany Challenges our Blockade"
krg_acw_lend_lease.16.d: "The blockade of the American Union State has been a chaotic and frantic operation. Though successful, it has caused a great deal of diplomatic incidents. Recently, a German shipment has decided to ignore our request to turn around, and continues sailing towards Norfolk, even after a more strongly worded letter was sent.\n\nThe shipment continues sailing towards Norfolk, and a pair of German cruisers have loudly announced their arrival in the area. Additionally, our spies report a recent increase in Kaiserliche activity. Although our local naval dominance is not under threat, the implications of such an action are clear: Germany is attempting to run our blockade.\n\nAllowing the shipment through would not only allow advanced German equipment into the Union's hands, would also be a sign of weakness to our Allies. On the other hand, the risk of this escalating into a war with Germany should not be underestimated. Future generations may curse our actions as having started the Third Weltkrieg."

Even with our cruisers nearby, they fired a warning shot, followed by a much closer warning shot. When our fleet continued on, their patience ran out, and the third shot was no longer a warning. The shell exploded on the deck of one of our transports killing 3 German sailors.\n\nThe Navy is outraged, and demands an immediate response. Even some of our most cautious diplomats believe New England has crossed the line, with some calling for a declaration of war. A war, however, would not bring back the three sailors Germany has lost. Indeed, the intervention of the Accord and Canada could lead to nuclear war, right as our nation undergoes its recovery from the 2nd Weltkrieg. Neither choice is preferable, but one must be made."

A pitched battle ensued, ended when planes of the NEHS Bunker Hill sunk one of the German cruisers, and forced the scuttling of the other. The Lend Lease shipment has been seized, and tough blow has been dealt to German naval pride.\n\nFollowing the battle, Germany relayed a message to our government, informing them of the unacceptability of our actions, joined by a Declaration of War. Our nation is at war with Germany, and the Accord has confirmed that they support us to the fullest.\n\nThe 3rd Weltkrieg is upon us."
