worldnews.1.t: "The End of the Second Weltkrieg"
worldnews.1.d: "After seven years of a war that touched every continent on the globe, the bloodiest conflict in human history has drawn to a close.\n\nThe Commune of France fell in 1945, and the Russian State was forced to sign a ceasefire some seven months ago, but now the Internationale's final bastion has finally fallen. Oswald Mosley's Union of Britain capitulated following the shocking detonation of 'Heimdallr' and the subsequent invasions by Entente and German forces. For the people of the Reichspakt and Entente, the victory in Europe is cause for celebration, however the peace it's left behind is uneasy at best.\n\nThe diplomatic relations between the 'Weltallianz' have broken down after a series of political clashes over the situation in Europe, and the optimistic co-operation promised by the Halifax Conference is now a distant memory. All the while, the terrifying weapon that the Kaiser now possesses is a concern to all. Whatever the next decade will bring, it's clear the world has entered a new age."

worldnews.2.t: "The Beginning of the 'Kalterkrieg'"
worldnews.2.d: "'We are entering a new stage in modern warfare, and shall we win against the German Empire in this Kalterkrieg!' -  Sir Mackenzie King\n\nFollowing months of disintegrating Reichspakt-Entente relations, and in his last official speech as Prime Minister, Mackenzie King held a scathing speech directed at the 'dictatorial' German Empire and its actions following the Second Weltkrieg. The 'Kalterkrieg' Speech, as its being called, has been extremely divisive. Many Canadians, have praised King for supporting Canada's critical role in global affairs. Many however are extremely worried that such antagonization could see the beginning of another devastating Weltkrieg. The German response has been apopleptic, with the Kaiser simply stating that 'Germany only wants to see peace on the world stage', while also taking offence to King's mistranslation of 'Cold War'.\n\nThe entire world has been shaken by this unprecedented speech, though its ramifications likely won't be felt for some time."

worldnews.3.t: "Conservatives win the 1950 General Election"
worldnews.3.d: "Over 2 years after the restoration of the United Kingdom, following a prolonged period of reconstruction and de-syndicalisation, the first General Election since 1923 was called. Going into the election, no party had a commanding advantage and it looked like anyone could win. Of course, there had to be a winner.\n\nWith the votes in, the results are clear. Prime Minister Anthony Eden has led his reformed Conservative Party to a victory, securing a slim majority in the House of Commons. The Conservatives were always considered to be the favourites, with many of the National Government's accomplishments directly attributed to them. Even so, it took a lot of ideological compromise to create a manifesto that could appeal to the still rather divided nation. Though questions hang over Eden's ability to govern long-term, owing to his injuries and ailments, he has already formally dissolved the National Government coalition, and the stage is set for strong Conservative governance over the next 5 years. With the success of the general election, democracy once again reigns supreme in Britain."

worldnews.4.t: "Liberals win the 1950 General Election"
worldnews.4.d: "Over 2 years after the restoration of the United Kingdom, following a prolonged period of reconstruction and de-syndicalisation, the first General Election since 1923 was called. Going into the election, no party had a commanding advantage and it looked like anyone could win. Of course, there had to be a winner.\n\nWith the votes in, the Liberal Party has surprisingly secured the most seats. Despite being considered a third party heading into the election, the Liberals are victorious, having ridden Herbert Samuel's personal popularity, in addition to playing the two larger parties off of each other, so they could present themselves as a viable alternative. Though Samuel has been invited to form a government, question marks remain. Many are concerned that Samuel's age will inhibit his ability to govern, though the elder statesman has consistently brushed off such comments. It's up to Samuel's cabinet, over the next five years, to prove that the Liberal comeback isn't a fluke. With the success of the general election, democracy once again reigns supreme in Britain."

worldnews.5.t: "Democratic-Labour wins the 1950 General Election"
worldnews.5.d: "Over 2 years after the restoration of the United Kingdom, following a prolonged period of reconstruction and de-syndicalisation, the first General Election since 1923 was called. Going into the election, no party had a commanding advantage and it looked like anyone could win. Of course, there had to be a winner.\n\nWith the votes in, the result is clear. Democratic-Labour has carried the day, and Herbert Morrison has been made Prime Minister. Predominantly made up of prominent defectors from the Union of Britain, the newly formed party had a strong base of former syndicalists to draw upon. Their victory has been attributed to the mobilisation of this once jaded voter base, which swung many votes across the country. Herbert Morrison's new government has a stable majority, but there are concerns. The new party is already dogged by factionalism, with barely moderated syndicalists competing with centrists for dominance, and Morrison is going to need to work hard to unify the factions. In any case, with the success of the general election, democracy once again reigns supreme in Britain."

worldnews.6.t: "End of the Birmingham Trials"
worldnews.6.d: "For years, there have been plans to put the most prolific warcriminals of the Third Internationale on trial, so the syndicalists could face their crimes in a military tribunal. The plans for a unifed tribunal fell through, and the Italian States and France held their own trials in 1946 and 1947 respectively. The delayed capitulation of the Union of Britain equally delayed the start of the Trials on the Crimes and Violations of International Law of the Maximist Criminal Organization, commonly referred to as the Birmingham Trials.\n\nFollowing months of hearings, the Tribunal has finally & successfully passed judgement, despite the general instability of the British Isles in the wake of the Restoration. Several high-ranking Maximist politicans have been sentenced to death, most prominently Oswald Mosley's 'butcherer' Neil Francis Hawkins. While there is dissapointment that the Grand Protector himself never faced trial, having died to mob violence at the end of the Second Weltkrieg, Britain can now rest easy, knowing the war-criminals have finally faced their crimes."
worldnews.6.a: "Justice has been served."

worldnews.7.t: "Anthony Eden Resigns"
worldnews.7.d: "After a 7 year tenure, Prime Minister Anthony Eden has resigned. Eden has cited an ongoing battle with an undisclosed health condition, which has apparently left him unable to adequately carry out his duties to 'King and Country'. Suspicions that the long-serving leader had been forced out by his Conservative Party were left unadressed.\n\nA close friend of King Edward VIII, Anthony Eden was elected Prime Minister in 1946 by an exile contingent in Canada. During his tenure, Eden oversaw end of the Second Weltkrieg, culminating in the Homecoming of 1947. Following this, he has presided over the reconstruction of the Home Isles; narrowly surviving an assasination attempt in 1949 that left him permanently scarred and weak. Though technically one of the most successful Prime Ministers ever, Eden has always been dogged by unpopularity due to a 'weakness' of leadership and supposed 'capitulations' to the German Empire. His successor will be chosen in the coming days."

worldnews.8.t: "The Chinese Civil War"
worldnews.8.d: "All news from East Asia can confirm one thing: a total civil war has broken out in China. According to multiple sources, the Beijing government and the de facto independent Guangzhou government had intended to negotiate in Xi’an to prepare for peaceful reunification. However, both sides could not agree on several key issues, and the Tianjin Massacre that happened recently was the last straw. With both sides blaming each other, all hopes for the peaceful reunification of China collapsed.\n\nThe Beiyang government in Beijing announced a counterinsurgency campaign against the ''Canton Rebels'' and started firing upon the Yangtze River frontline. At the same time, the Guangzhou government officially declared themselves as the rightful government of the Republic of China. Although the Beiyang government has been the central government recognized by the international community, especially the Reichspakt, the Guangzhou government with democratic ideals is gaining the favour of the Accord. One way or another, this war will change the balance of the Kalterkrieg in Asia."
worldnews.8.a: "Once again, China is engulfed in flames"

worldnews.9.t: "Guangzhou Victory in China"
worldnews.9.d: "Plum blossom flags of the now victorious Guangzhou Government rose in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and various cities in northern China as decades of Chinese internal turmoil finally came to an end. As the last organized Beiyang units surrendered to the NRA, the five-colored flag that had ruled China for more than three decades fell. During the celebration ceremony in the new capital of Nanjing, provisional president Chen Qiyou addressed the nation, declaring that the new Republic of China was the true successor of the Xinhai Revolution and Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s ideals.\n\nThe reaction of the international community is mixed. Berlin is reluctant to recognize the new China, while Ottawa and its allies gleefully declare it a 'victory for liberal democracy' and have congratulated the president. However, the West remains suspicious due to Guangzhou's radical reforms and ambiguous attitude towards syndicalism. In any case, the foundation of a New China will surely bring significant changes to the balance of power in East Asia."
worldnews.9.a: "A new age for China has come"

worldnews.10.t: "Beiyang Victory in China"
worldnews.10.d: "Decades of bloodshed in China have finally come to an end: the Beiyang Government is victorious. With NPA soldiers raising the five-colored flag on top of the burning Guangzhou government building, the last organized resistance of the southern army comes to an end. Most of the former Guangzhou Government’s senior officials either chose to submit or go into exile. Nonetheless, small-scale local resistance is still active.\n\nThe authoritarian rule of the Beiyang government has extended throughout the country and coincided with the announcement of plans to reorganize the National Pacification Army into a nationalized Chinese Defense Force based in Beijing. Berlin and New Orleans had already sent their congratulations, praising them for crushing the subversive conspiracy of the Accord and the Syndicalist KMT, while the Accord condemned the Beiyang government for \"oppressing the free people with dictatorial means.\" Now, the balance of Kalterkrieg in East Asia has shifted towards the Reichspakt."

worldnews.11.t: "The Abdication of Kaiser Karl"
worldnews.11.d: "As expected, Kaiser Karl I of the Danubian Federation announced his abdication last night, from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Crowned during the Weltkrieg, Karl I was one of the driving forces behind the radical federalist reforms of the ailing Habsburg Monarchy, culminating in the Danubian Federation's formation in 1939. A sickly man, Karl's various health problems have been highly publicised throughout his reign, and rumours of abdication have swirled for the last decade. Now, with the world at peace once more, Karl has chosen to abdicate the Danubian Throne.\n\nKarl will be succeeded by his eldest son, Otto. Highly federalist but also socially conservative, some fear Otto may end up being politically partisan, whereas Karl was avowedly nuetral. Simultaneously, Otto's dislike of the German Empire's growing autocracy is well known, and many fear their alliance wont last into the future. Whatever happens, Karl has created a prosperous and mostly stable nation from chaos, and his legacy will never be forgotten."
worldnews.11.a: "Today, we salute the Reformer!"

worldnews.12.t: "The Köln Crisis"
worldnews.12.d: "While the Kaiserreich generally presents itself to be a dominant and united Empire, the Second Weltkrieg has left the Empire rather divided. Chief among these divisions is the remnants of syndicalism in the formerly occupied Rhineland, historically an already liberal region that has become greatly opposed to the autocratic shift of Germany under Reichskanzler Ferdinand von Bredow and his Nationale Einheitsfront.\n\nIn the last few days, those simmering tensions have exploded after a rogue Freikorps division used lethal force to suppress peaceful anti-government protests, in the name of combatting militant remnants of the DOI. Now, the City of Köln and the surrounding cities have become paralysed with strikers and protestors, while actual syndicalist partisans have ramped up their activities. With the police barely able to keep the escalating situation under control, a national crisis is now gripping Germany. Whether Bredow's vision of a "New State" can weather the storm remains to be seen..."
worldnews.12.a: "A chink in the Kaiser's armour."

worldnews.13.t: "Ferdinand von Bredow Remains in Power"
worldnews.13.d: "For weeks, political unrest has gripped Köln and other major cities in the German Rhineland, and the crisis has brought Ferdinand von Bredow's administration to its knees. However, following very tense emergency negotiations, Bredow has been able to bring some semblance of peace and stability to the cities, and Kurt von Schleicher's deputy remains in the most powerful political position in the world.\n\nWhile Bredow's position is secure, the Köln Crisis is not over. Though he is currently pursuing a peaceful resolution, the Reichskanzler is prepared to use military force, if necessary, to definitively suppress the unrest. Whatever happens, Bredow's secured position means that his grand 'Neuer Staat' reforms can be fully realised, and emergency acts are already being prepared by his loyal cabinet to fulfill his vision. As the embers of Köln slowly fade away, it's obvious to the world that the Nationale Einheitsfront, and subsequently the Bredowist experiment is here to stay."

Now, following his failure to bring peace and stability to the cities, the Kaiser has seen it fit to dismiss the Reichskanzler, and has promoted Generalfeldmarschall Eberhard von Mackensen to the most powerful political position in the world.\n\nA hardliner in every sense of the word, Mackensen has already deployed the Heer to suppress the unrest in the region. With his brutal crackdown already winning him respect amongst the Nationale Einheitsfront, the Field Marshal's promotion signals that the Kaiser's faith in the 'New State' remains stronger than ever. With the Heer increasingly involved in political affairs, Mackensen is expected to continue Bredow's reforms. While the fires of Köln are slowly suppressed, it's obvious to the world that the Nationale Einheitsfront is here to stay."

The esteemed Economist's promotion signals that the Kaiser's faith in the 'New State' has remained strong despite the crisis. Popitz is expected to continue Bredow's reforms with a more civilian flair, using his ties to the Empire's largest industrialists to further entrench the burgeoning dictatorship. Whatever happens from here, it's obvious to the world that the Nationale Einheitsfront is here to stay."

Goerdeler's promotion was a surprise to many, as it appears that the Kaiser has completely lost faith in Bredow's autocratic 'New State'. The 1920 Constitution is expected to be restored and amended, with reforms to the Bundesrat and the Imperial voting system ready to be debated.

worldnews.18.d: "The aging Kaiser of the German Empire, Wilhelm III, has made very few public appearances over the past few months. While his duties as head of state have mostly been handled by his son, Kronprinz Wilhelm, there were hopes that he would recover and resume public life. Unfortunately, that hope has not come to fruition, and the Kaiser died last night at the age of 69. While exact information about his death has not yet been revealed, sources in Germany have stated that it was a heart attack that killed the monarch. He is survived by the Empress and his six children, the oldest of which, Wilhelm, will succeed him as Wilhelm IV.\n\nKronprinz Wilhelm will take the throne with a shaky line of succession, lacking a male heir to take his place should anything happen to the Kaiser-to-be. However, Wilhelm IV shares a similar political outlook as his grandfather, preferring strong central governance to liberal democracy. For that reason, it is likely that little will change in Berlin."

The up-and-coming Bertrand de Jouvenel was selected as the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. It's hoped that his reformist policies will kickstart the economy.\n\nÉmile Hugues was sworn in as Minister of Justice. Another old guard politician from the Weltkrieg era, Édouard Daladier, was confirmed as the new Minister of the Interior.

Prior to the coup, van Ryneveld had pressed Malan in person to abandon his proposed transition from British dominion to independent republic, which, in practice, would have cut most South African ties with the Accord. Malan's angrily rebuffed van Ryneveld, threatening to discharge the popular general from the general staff. \n\nWhile the actions of van Ryneveld have been applauded by Accord diplomats, van Ryneveld has endangered the South African stability, as NP supporters prepare to resist the pro-British government with anything that can crack the skull of an Anglo."

The breakthrough forced the opposing Boer government to the negotiation table, leading to the Peace of Durban, ending the conflict and disarming the Boer militias under direct control of the Boer government. \n\nWith the civil war seeing an end in South Africa, many expect a return to normality and liberal values in South Africa, which were promised by van Ryneveld after his coup d'état."

Strijdom has won the conflict and is starting to secure its new power. \n\nThe coup d'état organized by van Ryneveld would force the National Party leadership to reconsider its strategies, leaving Malan without any real allies in a sea of hungry sharks. Among these sharks, J.G. Strijdom came on top and reorganized the party according to the views of the white supremacist Baasskap of the party, introducing racial purity policies and crude republicanism into the party agenda. During the civil conflict, the Lion of the North would adopt more radical parts of Afrikaner society into the party, leading to more violence in the conflict, targetted to both the non-white population and the British loyalists.

With radicals still rife in the nation, many wonder if Zveno's government can consolidate their control over the country before more unrest crops up.

worldnews.37.d: "After a 7 year tenure, Prime Minister Anthony Eden has died at 55. Details on his sudden death are unclear, but it's believed he died following a pair of botched operations on his gall bladder. Though his health struggles are nothing new, the suddenness of his death has taken Westminster completely by surprise.\n\nA close friend of King Edward VIII, Anthony Eden was elected Prime Minister in 1946 by an exile contingent in Canada. During his tenure, Eden oversaw the end of the Second Weltkrieg, culminating in the Homecoming of 1947. Following this, he has presided over the reconstruction of the Home Isles; narrowly surviving an assasination attempt in 1949 that left him permanently scarred and weak. Though technically one of the most successful Prime Ministers ever, Eden has always been dogged by unpopularity due to a 'weakness' of leadership and supposed 'capitulations' to the German Empire. Richard Butler has been appointed Eden's successor, and a state funeral has been planned for the late Prime Minister."

However, the incapacitation of Jin's successor Liu Wenlong following a heart attack has given rise to a new period of intense instability in Dihua. A coup by the Guangzhou-backed Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection Alliance was able to consolidate control over the main population centers of the province, however Ughyur leader Muhammad Amin Bughra has declared the independence of East Turkestan with Russian backing.\n\nWith the Han Chinese and Uyghur factions moving to war, the nominally Beiyang-supporting (though functionally neutral and self-serving) armies of Hui Chinese warlord Ma Bufang have also entered the fray, hoping to capture the city of Dihua for the Ma family. As tensions rise between the rival governments in the east, Xinjiang looks to becoming a prelude of a increasingly inevitable conflict."

Between the ideological divide between Vienna and Berlin growing more stark by the day and Otto's public misgivings about the escalating Cold War, the relations between the two European powers have severely declined. Following brief talks in Munich, the Habsburg Monarch and his Minister-President unilaterally pulled out the Reichspakt alliance. In an intense speech from the Hofburg, Otto von Habsburg decried Kaiser Wilhelm IV's dictatorial regime, accusing him of 'international brinkmanship that is threatening to destroy European civilisation' through his actions towards the Accord.\n\nWhat affect these events will have on the Cold War is unknown; though the Federation is unlikely to join the Accord, the Reichspakt's global strength has taken a serious blow.

While he pledges to remain in NATO and the Accord, he is adamant that New England must build up its navy and army and not rely so heavily on Canadian personnel.\n\nHarriman served as the special envoy to Ottawa during the 2nd Weltkrieg, and when he returned to New England was elected the governor of Upstate New York. As governor he pursued an increase in government spending, specifically in infrastructure and welfare.\n\nPresident Baldwin was seen as an underdog, and Harriman was expected to win.

Danubia's relations with the Russian state have been strained since the ceasefire that heralded the end of the war after the atomic bomb was dropped on Portsmouth.\n\n Since that time a low-level insurgency has been ongoing along the Western border of Russia, with tacit support from the Reichspakt in general and the Danubian Federation specifically, in concert with the Skoropadsky government of the Ukrainian state. Relations were further stretched today with the official expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Wien by Otto von Habsburg himself, with his Minister-President present. In a formal statement, the accusation of "mistreatment of the Ukrainian minority by the policy of Russification is tantamount to an attempt at the complete eradication of a nation from the face of the earth". At this time the only Russian response has been a tit-for-tat expulsion of the Danubian ambassador from Moscow, but there is no doubt the Vozhd will have some kind of follow up."

Many observers suspected that the Union State would be able to press the advantage despite being surrounded, as its overall military capability was estimated to be roughly large enough to fight a 3 front war against the ARA. Despite this, the Union presumably thought differently over its prospects due possibly to the large international backing the ARA was receiving from the Accord.

The students seem to be split between many different demands and thoughts, with a single coherent message being somewhat lost.\n\nThey range from demands of liberalization, and abolishment of the monarchy, but most apparently, unifying under the South French Government. As the Protests drag on, the tension between them and the Police has only grown larger, with more militant students becoming the face of the protests. Many fear that Paris will yet again become a battleground as militarized police prepare for the worst, hoping to defuse the situation before it's too late."

worldnews.67.d: "What was once thought to be the start of a flame that would engulf Paris, has turned into smoldering embers. Despite the worst fears of many officials and the local population, the protests have scattered and dissipated back into normalcy. This came as a surprise to many observers outside the Reichspakt who felt the protests would become much worse. The students while hitting many high points during the march, could not maintain momentum, and many left to go back to their universities and homes. Despite the hopes of many citizens and officials in the accord, the protests slowly fizzled out over time due to the local population's lack of commitment and support.\n\nOther areas outside of Paris have been quelled, and normalcy returns to France again under the guise of the Roi and the Kaiser. A mix of relief and disappointment mixed through the population, with hopes of reunification within their lifetimes becoming far dimmer than before. While order has been restored, who knows what good or bad this will bring to the French people for the decades to come?"

Many members of the Revolutionary Government have for the most part surrendered to the German and French Royalist forces, while others have taken the nearly extinguished flame of liberty elsewhere to fight on for the Revolution. German forces meticulously went from building to building, declaring the city Liberated after the Palace of Versailles on the outskirts of the City, was stormed by joint German and Royal French forces. Pakt forces not long after, raised the flags of both the German Empire and Kingdom of France over the city from the Eiffel for all revolutionary forces to see, cutting down the morale of those who remained.\n\nWhile small numbers are attempting to rally after the City of Lights capture, the revolution seems to be coming to a grinding halt. While the city has been taken and largely secured, small pockets of resistance still remain such as a small Revolutionary band holed up on the Isle of Saint Louis, the city is now largely secured from the flames of Revolution, and victory for the King and Kaiser is all but assured."

This morning more bad news struck the Orléanist regime as the French Republic in the south sent troops to restore order to the region and reunify the nation under one banner. This rallying cry of a single French nation has caused another wave of defections amongst the royalist forces, with many seeing the full support of the French Republic as the chance to achieve that dream. The cause for this invasion is believed to have been to both take land central to France and expunge Royalist forces attempting to restabilize the Kings' Pro-German Regime.\n\nThe first of these attacks by the Republican troops would be at the namesake of the King Himself attacking the Royalist city of Orleans. The largest of the defections would occur on the mouth of the Loire River in the city with additional defectors crossing the borders at the city of Lyon to join the army of the Republic."

This however was short-lived as Pakt forces steamrolled through what the ragtag movement could muster.\n\nGerman forces swiftly and effectively executed their objectives by lighting fast movements and restoring order. The Orelanist Regime, despite the hiccups, has been thoroughly restored, with future resistance unlikely on any kind of larger scale for decades to come. For now, at least, reunification remains impossible for the foreseeable future under the Accord banner, and the Kingdom of France will reign in the north."

Once part of the United States of America, Alaska was placed under Canadian protection following the beginning of the Second American Civil War, a position it has remained in for over a decade since. However, as a result of pressure from both Canadian and American politicians, it appears as if Canada is ready to let the territory decide its future for itself.\n\nAlmost immediately following the annnouncement, a campaign has begun in earnest within the territory, with pro-American and pro-Canadian groups each vying to win over the votes of Alaskans. Both Ottawa and Sacramento seem to be backing their own campaigns through political and financial support, which places the result of the referendum in an uncertain place despite initial predictions of a slight American edge.

A statement from Ottawa assured the British people that Canada would defend the Homeland now that it has been liberated, and emphasized that Germany’s “overreaction” is precisely why Britain needs to rearm itself.\n\nThe German navy far exceeds the Canadian one by tonnage, but the Accord is putting its faith in its advanced carrier technology. The Canadian and New Englander military-industrial complex heavily invested in naval technology during the Second Weltkrieg due to the necessity of trans-Atlantic operations.

The militaries of the Accord and Germany have both begun to stand down now that a crisis has been averted.\n\nBritain agreed to stay under a reduced set of sanctions that will allow them to justifiably protect their people without unrestricted rearmament. Meanwhile, Germany was satisfied with keeping British naval power limited in exchange for a few reasonable concessions on their right to a defensive military.

Almost certainly supported by Brazil, the Abrillist-Liberal Revolutionary Coalition hopes to knock out the Argentine-backed Colorados with a tide of popular support.

The nations who are meant to be the primary targets include South France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.\n\nNew England has promised a similar bill will be passed within a year to follow up on these initial expenditures. While after previous wars nations would be hesitant to send their hard-earned money to people who were recently enemies, General Montgomery has convinced Canadians that aid to the former syndicalists in Italy, France, and England are no longer the Accord's enemies, but are freedom-loving people who deserve safety from the Reichspakt's heavy hand."

Now the city is completely controlled by [new_controller.GetNameDef], its many artists and musicians living in apprehension of what will become of this cultural bastion of Europe.\n\n[new_controller.GetNameDefCap] is planning a great military parade around the Ringstraße in celebration of this massive military feat, and the [new_controller.GetAdjective] general in charge of the occupation is going to address citizens from the balcony off of Neue Burg to try to ease the worries of a population worn by weeks of fighting."

 worldnewscitycapture.278.t: "The Fall of Beijing"
 worldnewscitycapture.278.d: "After days of high-intensity fighting in the capital suburbs, [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops finally scaled the walls of the Outer City, scattering the defenders and making further defence of the capital all but untenable. With rail lines into and out of the city thoroughly cut, the remaining [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces quickly thinned as deserting soldiers melted into the urban population.\n\nWhile [new_controller.GetAdjective] colours now fly over Tiananmen Gate, the flames at Zhengyangmen send towering columns of thick black smoke into the sky, its sad symbolism lost on few among the war-weary population. China can only hope that the city's new occupiers, one of many since the turn of the century, can finally restore some modicum of peace and order where so many before them have failed."
 worldnewscitycapture.278.a: "Beijing has fallen? How can this be?!"
 worldnewscitycapture.278.b: "The Forbidden City is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.278.c: "Another war in China, another occupation of Beijing."
 worldnewscitycapture.278.d.chi: "After days of high-intensity fighting in the capital suburbs, [new_controller.GetNameDef]'s troops finally scaled the walls of the Outer City, scattering the defenders and making further defence of the capital all but untenable. The arrival of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] Army in the Forbidden City was marked by little pomp or circumstance, drawing stark contrast to the grand military parades immediately put together by Zhang Zuolin when he reconquered the city less than a decade ago. \n\nInstead, immediate efforts have been put towards setting up a new administration and securing control over pockets of resistance still present in some parts of the city. Once that effort is complete, a ceremony is planned by [new_controller.GetLeader] announcing the formation of the Unified Federal Governement of China, in advance of [old_controller.GetNameDef]'s assured defeat."
 worldnewscitycapture.278.a.chi: "We cannot lose Beijing again!"

 worldnewscitycapture.279.t: "The Fall of Shanghai"
 worldnewscitycapture.279.d: "In an event all too familiar to many of its residents, chaos has returned to Shanghai this week as reports trickle out that [new_controller.GetName] forces are now in control of the city. Once an island of relative stability thanks to its international mandate, the fires of the Second Weltkrieg saw Shanghai open to a revolving door of occupiers, Germans, Japanese, and Chinese warlords among them. While [new_controller.GetNameDef] claims that their occupation represents a necessary, albeit painful, step in bringing the city back on its feet, only time will tell. \n\nShanghai's future again seems unclear, as its prosperity has been slowly drained by the continued cycles of instability, and with the new occupation reports say that another exodus of foreign residents seems to be underway."
 worldnewscitycapture.279.a: "We will retake the city, no matter what."

 worldnewscitycapture.279.c: "The days of the Legation Cities seem long gone..."

 worldnewscitycapture.280.t: "The Fall of Warsaw"
 worldnewscitycapture.280.d: "Once described as 'The Paris of the East' during the Renaissance, Warsaw has hit rough times in recent memory. There was hope after the Weltkrieg of renewal but, alas, fate has not been kind, as the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army collapsed trying to defend the city from both sides of the Vistula river from advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nIn a bitter twist to old memories, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has been plundered again by [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers before they fled the city, according to [new_controller.GetNameDef]. [old_controller.GetNameDefCap] hotly contests this, claiming [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops ransacked the Palace after heavy fighting. Regardless, with the fall of its capital, the future of [old_controller.GetNameDef] is in jeopardy."
 worldnewscitycapture.280.a: "Poland is not yet lost..."

 worldnewscitycapture.281.d: "When the foothills outside the Blue Mountains were lost to the invading [new_controller.GetAdjective] army, it was only a matter of time before the city fell. Through a series of controlled engagements, [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces pulled back slowly, and by yesterday made it to the docks, but with the capture of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (which the defenders didn't destroy due to its significance to the people of the city) their commander has negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nOriginally a city of released British inmates, Sydney is experiencing bitter irony as the city itself is now a prison. Even worse, military experts predict this could be the beginning of the end of [old_controller.GetNameDef], as the loss of such a vital city is a tough blow to bear."
 worldnewscitycapture.281.a: "We shall return to Sydney soon enough."
 worldnewscitycapture.281.b: "Finally Sydney is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.281.c: "The [old_controller.GetAdjective] situation is dire."

 worldnewscitycapture.282.t: "The Fall of Mexico City"
 worldnewscitycapture.282.d: "Mexico City, the oldest capital in North America and the 5th-largest by population, fell today to invading [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces, who encircled the city and then moved into the lake bed from the west, cutting the major transportation arteries through the lower areas and forcing [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders to bleed off into the foothills to the east. As of today, the general in charge of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] occupation was sighted entering the National Palace to negotiate with the governor for a ceasefire.\n\nRumours claim [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops are touring the old Aztec ruins and picking up 'free' souvenirs for themselves, and now it looks like the survivors of Spanish tyranny will learn to live under the yoke of [new_controller.GetAdjective] control."
 worldnewscitycapture.282.a: "It does not end here."

 worldnewscitycapture.283.d: "Reports from Algiers, the city where a mere decade ago the French-exiles planned their return to the continent, tell of its capture by advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. After progressing slowly albeit efficiently through the great colonial avenues near the Coast [new_controller.GetNameDef] forces met heavier resistance when leaving the sight of the bay in the more popular districts of Algiers' heights. Fierce fights have taken place between [new_controller.GetAdjective] and [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers, especially in the popular European district of Bab-El-Oued and in the famous Notre-Dame-D'Afrique Basilica, but by dawn most of the city had fallen with the last pockets of resistance eliminated in the Casbah. As the dawn broke over the bay, the morning sun unveiled a city under a new protector."
 worldnewscitycapture.283.d.alg: "The [new_controller.GetNameDef] forces returned to Algiers today, but this time to restore order rather than plan in exile. Despite calls for decolonization and the fierce resistance of native Algerians, the French government was determined to land and reclaim the Joyous City. After progressing slowly albeit efficiently through the great colonial avenues near the Coast [new_controller.GetNameDef] forces met heavier resistance when leaving the sight of the bay in the more popular districts of Algiers' heights. Fierce fights have taken place between [new_controller.GetAdjective] and [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers, especially in the district of Bab-El-Oued and in the famous Notre-Dame-D'Afrique Basilica, but by dawn most of the city had fallen and the last pockets of resistance eliminated in the Casbah. As dawn broke over the bay, the French tricolour once again flew high above the walls."

 worldnewscitycapture.284.d: "[new_controller.GetAdjective] forces made a daring race across the West Side of Detroit, catching their enemy unaware. Today, their efforts came to fruition as the defender of Detroit retreated into Midtown. To many attackers, the aftermath of Dearborn hastened the zeal to push towards the Detroit River, securing the city.\n\nThe fall of Detroit has been well celebrated by [new_controller.GetNameDef], who now have both the strategic and symbolic powerhouse of America's heavy industry."

 worldnewscitycapture.285.d.nee: "The people of Boston, along with the New England Armed Forces, made their impression on [new_controller.GetAdjective]. The invading force entered the Third Tunnel under heavy resistance, encircling Boston via the Charles River. The New England National Guard was forced to evacuate via Cambridge, losing Jamaica Plains entirely to the enemy.\n\nThe historical and symbolic significance of this victory was not lost on [new_controller.GetNameDef], who have set about to capitalise on the city's remaining symbols of American independence, such as the Old North Church, now dwarfed by the barricades all around it."
 worldnewscitycapture.285.d.other: "A careful application of force was sufficient for [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces to dislodge the defenders in Boston's Inner Belt. After furious battles in the port, the city's defenders were forced to retreat across the Charles River towards Everett in humiliating defeat. Both soldiers and civilians are in disarray.\n\nInterviews of [new_controller.GetAdjective] men on the scene report that while they may have proved victorious against their enemies in [old_controller.GetNameDef] only by a brutal battle, the invading troops are still prioritising saving the historic monuments of Boston."
 worldnewscitycapture.285.a: "With Boston in our hands, New England is secured."

 worldnewscitycapture.285.c: "The Athens of America has fallen..."

 worldnewscitycapture.286.t: "The Fall of Tokyo"
 worldnewscitycapture.286.d: "Today, the whole of Japan was shaken to its core as [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces finally took the capital after some fierce fighting. Despite the hopes of [new_controller.GetAdjective] planners, it seems that the Imperial Palace was evacuated successfully, leaving the whereabouts of the Emperor and the government unknown.\n\nWith the Japanese capital in foreign hands for the first time in history, the mood among [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces can only be described as grim. It was long believed by the Japanese public that the might of their armed forces and the nation's position would render an invasion impossible. The arrival of [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops lays the falseness of this statement bare, and it seems that [old_controller.GetAdjective] hegemony over East Asia has been shattered forever."
 worldnewscitycapture.286.a: "A great victory!"
 worldnewscitycapture.286.b: "We must not lose hope."
 worldnewscitycapture.286.c: "The jewel of all Asia has fallen."

 worldnewscitycapture.287.d.chi: "Following a determined offensive, [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers finally overcame the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders today and secured Manchuria's most important city. [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops were quick to surround the walled Old City and and launch an assault that destroyed much of the old Manchu palace. Most of [old_controller.GetNameDef]'s local leadership fled before the invaders fully established control.\n\nWith the city lost, it seems little will stand in the way of [new_controller.GetNameDef]'s drive to reunite China. [old_controller.GetLeader] himself seems to recognise the gravity of the situation: the city must be retaken soon."
 worldnewscitycapture.287.d.other: "Despite the desperate efforts of Fengtian's [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders, the city fell today after a battle marked by days of fierce urban combat. Fighting was most intense in and around the Huanggutun railway station, which found itself the target of several successive [new_controller.GetAdjective] assaults. The [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces were eventually dislodged, but not before tearing up the station's rails, leaving it mostly unusable for the time being.\n\nRegardless, the city's capture is a great victory for the [new_controller.GetAdjective] campaign against China. The path to Beijing and the north china plain is now open, and many citizens across the country nervously understand what this may mean."

 worldnewscitycapture.288.d: "Today, the city of Vladivostok, a major eastern port for [old_controller.GetNameDefCap] has been captured by [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. Rising to prominence as the home of the Russian Pacific Fleet, the city historically has come to symbolize Russian power projection in the pacific. The relative peace the city has seen throughout the tumultuous 20th century, has now been shattered as the chaos of the modern day arrived on its shores. With the capture of the city, [old_controller.GetNameDefCap]'s position has become extremely precarious."
 worldnewscitycapture.288.a: "Huzzah!"
 worldnewscitycapture.288.b: "Our fortunes shall improve soon."
 worldnewscitycapture.288.c: "[old_controller.GetNameDefCap] has all but lost their hold on the Pacific."

 worldnewscitycapture.289.t: "The Fall of Dublin"
 worldnewscitycapture.289.d: "Today, multiple reports from Ireland confirm that the city of Dublin has been captured by [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. In a scene that must have drawn parallels to the Syndicalist occupation, enemy forces advanced on the city centre, elements of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] military made futile attempts to hold key buildings, culminating in their last stand on O'Connell Street attempting to hold the General Post Office until they were overwhelmed by repeated attacks from [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops.\n\nMuch of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] civilian and military leadership managed to evacuate to the countryside, vowing to continue the fight against [new_controller.GetNameDef] in an act of defiance that harkens back to the Second Weltkrieg."

 worldnewscitycapture.290.d.ins: "[new_controller.GetAdjective] military dispatches today confirmed that Batavia, the capital of [old_controller.GetNameDefCap] has fallen following an assault on the city. While once a centre of Dutch rule in the East Indies the city has since become the capital of the new [old_controller.GetAdjective] nation.\n\nDespite a [new_controller.GetAdjective] declaration urging locals to comply with the occupation, the population has been eager to demonstrate to the new occupation authority that they would not give up their recent independence so easily. For the rest of [old_controller.GetNameDefCap] however the fall of Batavia is a devastating blow to national pride on top of a strategic disaster. As the evacuated [old_controller.GetAdjective] government begins to reorganise itself it remains to be seen if they can drive this new conqueror off their islands."
 worldnewscitycapture.290.d.other: "Today it was announced that Batavia, the largest city on Java and a key city in the region had fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. The [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag now flies over the old Governor-General's palace as their forces move to secure the harbour and other key areas of the city.\n\nThe fall of Batavia marks a dramatic shift in the balance of power in the East Indies, and gives the [new_controller.GetAdjective] military a firm base from which to exert control over the lucrative islands of the Archipelago. In the face of such a defeat it remains to be seen if [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces will be able to stabilise the situation and regain control."

 worldnewscitycapture.291.d: "Many decades have passed since Bucharest was occupied during the Weltkrieg, and now it has once again fallen into enemy hands. Despite the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army's spirited defence, [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops have forced their way through. The ageing forts around the city were reactivated to provide some relief to the capital, but it was no use. The Armenian and Jewish Quarters and the Uranus area still offer resistance, the latter aided by the presence of the Metropolitanate and Arsenal Hills. Yet, with the major arteries of Calea Victoriei, Queen Elisabeta Boulevard and Serban Voda Way captured, their fall is all but certain. The residents dread what the occupation may bring, with the last one still within living memory, despite [new_controller.GetAdjective] attempts to assuage local concerns. While [old_controller.GetLeader] has pledged to fight on, the future of [old_controller.GetNameDef] is uncertain."
 worldnewscitycapture.291.a: "We will return!"

The capture of the city was relatively swift, and compared to previous sacks of Constantinople merciful. However, many historical sites were still damaged, in particular the Blue Mosque, which was levelled by [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops while eliminating a final pocket of resistance in the fallen city. The government of [new_controller.GetNameDef] has declared the capture the formal reconquest of the old Roman capital for Christendom, and an envoy from [new_controller.GetLeader] has been dispatched to reconvert the Hagia Sophia Mosque to an Eastern Orthodox basilica."

The capture of the city was relatively swift, and compared to previous sacks of Constantinople merciful. However, many historical sites were still damaged, in particular the Dolmabahce, which was badly damaged by fighting during a final stand of [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops. The [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops are now patrolling the streets of the ancient city, and the government of [new_controller.GetNameDef] has declared their intent of governing the city with as light a touch as possible."

After rapid landings and skirmishes along the beach, invading soldiers eventually overcame the final defences on the extreme point of Monte Hacho. [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [new_controller.GetAdjective] invaders for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nThe battle for Ceuta was a bloodbath, involving house-to-house combat in the narrow confines of the city's main streets, which didn't offer much in form of cover for artillery and naval support from surrounding forces."

 worldnewscitycapture.294.d: "As the \"Venice of the North,\" Amsterdam has long been admired for its beautiful canals and port; despite a brutal occupation in the Second Weltkrieg and a long, difficult reconstruction process, the city managed to reclaim its status as a European centre for the arts. Unfortunately, despite painstaking efforts from the Dutch, Amsterdam is a battlefield once more. As refugees flee in all directions, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders have declared Amsterdam as an open city, following a successful campaign from the [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. As fighting in the city ceased, and [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces began marching down the Muntplein, the pale horse seemed to rear its ugly head again in the city."

 worldnewscitycapture.295.d: "Straddling the banks of the River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps, the city of Munich is the seat of the Bavarian administration and is a centre of arts, sciences, architecture, and culture. Under the reign of Prince Regent Luitpold, the city saw an explosion of artistic and cultural activity.\nHowever, the city has come under siege in the recent conflict and, after an exhausting battle, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces have evacuated the city. Much of the city lies in ruins, with the Marienplatz lying in rubble, and the domes of the Frauenkirche are heavily damaged as a result of intense bombing. The last of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] resistance in the city's heart at the New Town Hall has finally surrendered to the victorious [new_controller.GetAdjective] army. With the fall of Munich imminent, it would appear that the fall of southern Germany will come soon."

The earliest architectural relics date back to 300 BCE - a testament to Delhi's ancient history and the city's resilience.\nHowever, the city of Delhi has fallen to enemy forces, and the ancient city's buildings are once again at risk of being destroyed. Once again, since the bloody siege of 1857, the city of Delhi was placed under attack with the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders breaking under an impressive offensive made by [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. Reports from the city have indicated that the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army has began herding [old_controller.GetAdjective] prisoners and survivors into the Purana Qila, an ancient fortress now serving as an internment camp."

While the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army has pledged to maintain a peaceful occupation; fires rage throughout the city, and refugees have been attempting to flee by sea. Some buildings like the House of the Black Heads lie in ruin after intense bombing from the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army, despite only recently being reconstructed from the Second Weltkrieg.  Backed to the sea, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender to the victorious [new_controller.GetAdjective] army in order to prevent the further destruction of their city."

Over many years since explorers first sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Town has outgrown its original purpose as a faraway outpost.The once prosperous and even largest city in South Africa has experienced a reversal of fortune as [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces stormed the city recently in a successful campaign. The desperate [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders attempted to rally a defence at the Castle of Good Hope, but it was clear that the battle was over by nightfall. While the port of Cape Town sustained damage during the battle, it will no doubt serve to fulfil the strategic needs of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army as they begin their occupation of the city."

Heavy fighting took place on the Avenida de Mayo and the Avenida de Julio as the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders made desperate last stands in major buildings across the city. The fighting became bloody house to house fighting but eventually the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders began to emerge from their hiding spots in surrender.

The mountains of Chile and its location on the narrow western side of South America offer Santiago a sense of security. However, this does not seem to be the case as despite the geographical advantage; [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers have successfully entered the city after an intense battle with the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders. In the ensuing battle, firefights took place along the famous Alameda avenue. [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers were able to smash through the [old_controller.GetAdjective] barricades and fortifications on the Paseo Ahumada. Disorganised and crippled, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender."

 worldnewscitycapture.301.c: "The City of the Island Hills has fallen..."
 worldnewscitycapture.301.d.argentina: "After a long and gruelling campaign fighting all across the Andes mountains, the Argentine flag flies proudly over La Moneda Palace. The fighting was intense throughout the city streets on the famous Alameda avenue and the Paseo Ahumada, with Chilean forces offering intense resistance. However, the Argentines could eliminate the Chilean resistance in the city, and those that survived eagerly offered their surrenders to the victorious Argentine Army.\nWith the loss of Santiago, it would appear that Argentina now has the upper hand in the South American conflict. Chilean morale is undoubtedly low, and outside observers remark that it is only a matter of time before unrest grows due to Chile's lack of progress in its war against Argentina."
 worldnewscitycapture.301.a.argentina: "A glorious victory, we have triumphed once again!"
 worldnewscitycapture.301.c.argentina: "History repeats itself once more."

 worldnewscitycapture.302.t: "The Fall of Minsk"
 worldnewscitycapture.302.d: "Minsk has had something of a complicated history in the 20th century. Between the short lived Belorussian state and cultural revival, to its recapture and re-russification by Savinkov during the Second Weltkrieg, the only constant seems to be the City's unfortunate place on the frontlines.\nHowever history is nothing if not cyclical, and once again, Minsk finds herself a embroiled in war - only this time she is occupied by [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces. Much of the city has been damaged by intense bombing and shelling, and reports indicate a considerable degree of refugees fleeing from the chaos, despite offering staunch resistance, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders have ultimately offered their unconditional surrender to the victorious [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces and only time will tell how difficult the reconstruction of Minsk will once again be."
 worldnewscitycapture.302.a: "The great city of Belarus is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.302.b: "We will never surrender!"
 worldnewscitycapture.302.c: "A dark day for the [old_controller.GetAdjective] people..."

 worldnewscitycapture.303.t: "The Fall of Vilnius"
 worldnewscitycapture.303.d: "Still known for its \"old town,\" one of the largest surviving medieval towns in Northern Europe - despite the damage sustained during the Second Weltkrieg - Vilnius is a place where some of Europe's most excellent architectural styles - gothic, renaissance, neoclassical, and baroque stand side by side with each other.\nHowever, dark times descend on the city's inhabitants once again as the fires of war consumed Vilnius. Brutal street-to-street fighting ensued as the [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces attempted to reduce the defence of the city and drive out the [old_controller.GetAdjective] Army entirely. After an excruciating battle with much of the city lying in ruins and flames, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders finally surrendered. With futher major damage dealt to its historic landmarks, it is still too soon to tell whether or not Vilnius can recover its former glory."
 worldnewscitycapture.303.a: "We shall fight to the last!"
 worldnewscitycapture.303.b: "The \"Jerusalem\" of the North is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.303.c: "The great Lithuanian city has fallen?"

 worldnewscitycapture.304.t: "The Fall of Nanjing"
 worldnewscitycapture.304.d: "After a withering days-long bombardment from atop Zijinshan, the 'Purple Mountain', and repeated assaults against its walls, Nanjing fell in the early evening. The defenders at the Zhonghua and Guanghua gates fought to the last man, their corpses littering the city's great walls, as their comrades began a fighting retreat through its winding streets. With no relief in sight, and following the failure of [old_controller.GetAdjective] units outside the city to regain control of the Zijinshan batteries, the few units remaining within face only annihilation. The loss of the old southern capital will no doubt be a blow to the [old_controller.GetAdjective] war effort, though [old_controller.GetLeader] has already vowed [Prev.GetHerHis] commitment to eventual victory."
 worldnewscitycapture.304.a: "The "Southern" Capital is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.304.b: "We would rather die than surrender! We will be back!"
 worldnewscitycapture.304.c: "The great city of Nanjing has fallen"

 worldnewscitycapture.305.t: "The Fall of Wuhan"
 worldnewscitycapture.305.d: "After a pitched battle, the tri-city area of Wuhan fell to [new_controller.GetName] forces earlier today. Its defenders may have hoped to repeat Wu Peifu's successful 1926 defence of Wuchang, and turn the battle into a prolonged siege, but a concerted assault and the absence of relief by river dashed these hopes completely. With [new_controller.GetNameDef] flag waving atop both the governor's mansion and Luojia Hill, [new_controller.GetName] forces have struck a considerable blow against [old_controller.GetNameDef], and seized one of China's greatest logistical hubs alongside one of its most productive arsenals. Whether [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] will one day be viewed as a turning point, or merely another battle, it seems certain to haunt the minds of [old_controller.GetNameDef] leadership for some time to come."
 worldnewscitycapture.305.a: "Wuhan, the city of rivers is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.305.b: "We would rather die than surrender! We will be back!"
 worldnewscitycapture.305.c: "A serious defeat for [old_controller.GetNameDef]"
 
 worldnewscitycapture.306.t: "The Fall of Guangzhou"
 worldnewscitycapture.306.d: "After fierce house-to-house fighting, [new_controller.GetName] forces captured of Guangzhou early this morning. Often known by the name 'Canton' internationally, the port city is south China's largest industrial and commercial hub outside Hong Kong, and its loss will be a serious setback to the [old_controller.GetNameDef] war effort. Although the city's docklands and narrow alleyways seem secure, rumours speak of organising resistance in the Baiyun mountains to the north, and from there perhaps an attempt to retake the city.\n\nSouth China and Guangdong in particular are known for their resistance to outside control, be it from Beijing or elsewhere. Holding the city could be more than [new_controller.GetLeader] bargained for."
 worldnewscitycapture.306.a: "With Guangzhou secured, Southern China is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.306.a.fng: "We are China's true and only government!"
 worldnewscitycapture.306.b: "A defeat, true, but one that we shall return from!"

 worldnewscitycapture.306.c.fng: "Surely China can be united only by the sword?"

 worldnewscitycapture.307.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 worldnewscitycapture.307.d: "As the furthest navigable point on the mighty Yangtze, the streets of Chongqing once brimmed with refugees; rich and poor alike, all fleeing the unstoppable [new_controller.GetNameDef] advance. That was several days ago. As the city sirens wailed, and the thunder and flash of artillery marked the final stand of its defenders on the river's eastern bank, the city again emptied. The stampede claimed almost as many lives as the invaders.\n\nNow the streets are quiet, filled only by smoke, debris, and bodies. With the fall of Chongqing, little lies between [old_controller.GetName] and the total domination of southwestern China."
 worldnewscitycapture.307.a: "With this victory, we have secured Sichuan!"
 worldnewscitycapture.307.b: "A serious loss, but we will recover!"
 worldnewscitycapture.307.c: "A major defeat for [old_controller.GetNameDef]"

 worldnewscitycapture.308.t: "The Fall of Kunming"
 worldnewscitycapture.308.d: "For the first time since the defeat of the Three Feudatories in 1681, the city of Kunming has fallen to an invader from outside Yunnan Province. After losing the Wujiaba aerodrome to the southeast, [old_controller.GetNameDef] forces were gradually forced back along Lake Dian, only to finally break as the city's ancient walls were overrun. As [new_controller.GetNameDef] troops march beneath the iconic Jinma-Biji arches, their leaders must sit content with the knowledge that they control not only the prolific Kunming Arsenal, but also the terminus to the hugely profitable Kunming-Haiphong Railway."
 worldnewscitycapture.308.a: "With this victory, our hold in the west of China is secured."
 worldnewscitycapture.308.b: "We will make our stand in the mountains beyond!"
 worldnewscitycapture.308.c: "The mountains of Yunnan have a new master..."

 worldnewscitycapture.309.t: "The Fall of Jinan!"
 worldnewscitycapture.309.d: "Since the end of the warlord era, Jinan has had something of an unscrupulous reputation among Chinese cities. Once home to both the Dogmeat General's armies and Zhang Tianran's cult, malcontent seemed to simmer in the city despite the efforts of the Beiyang Government. Chaos now consumes Jinan once more as the city fell earlier today.\n\nAs [old_controller.GetAdjective] armies march through the streets, fire consumes both the old mansion of Zhang Zongchang and the temple on Mount Tai. Fitting symbolism for a city which once more has a new master."
 worldnewscitycapture.309.a: "The City of Springs is ours!"
 worldnewscitycapture.309.b: "This is nothing but a tactical retreat!"
 worldnewscitycapture.309.c: "I see..."

 worldnewscitycapture.310.d: "Founded by the legendary conqueror Alexander himself, the city of Alexandria was best known for housing wonders such as the Library of Alexandria and the Necropolis.\nHowever, history repeats itself as the ancient city has once again been conquered by a foreign power. After a heavy bombardment, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] were forced to retreat into the Citadel of Qaitbay. Surrounded on all sides and with their only escape being the sea, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] made a desperate defence. However, with their supplies being limited and morale low, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender to the victorious [new_controller.GetAdjective] army. Despite the great victory however, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces have pledged not to harm the city's historical buildings."
