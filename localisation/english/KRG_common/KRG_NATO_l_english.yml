krg_nato.1.t: "NATO Approved"
krg_nato.1.d: "At last, the scheme of the North American Trade Organization has been passed through Parliament. Despite the efforts of some critics, arguing Canada stands strongest alone, almost all of the political sphere has united behind this proposal. Some wish to see total Canadian dominance, others a generous dispensation of economic aid from Ottawa; all, however, are curious as to what form the future might bring. Over the coming weeks, delegates from four nations will gather to write regulations and protocols for this group. With each seeking to achieve their own objectives, they will chart the continent's economic flow for many decades to come."
krg_nato.1.a: "Here's to a prosperous future!"

krg_nato.2.t: "The Nature of NATO"
krg_nato.2.d: "The organization of NATO, while it may seem simple, has a surprising level of thought and complexity which went into its planning. For one thing, Canada's international alliance network will never be permitted to enter it: it is to be restricted to Canada herself and the secessionist states she supports to the south. The Pacific States of America are to be the largest contributor, but the Great Lakes Government and Commonwealth of New England have their own economies, not to be disregarded lightly. Each member has a fully equal say in the structure and systems NATO employs, theoretically, but in reality Canada is expected to dominate negotiations. We shall have to see which occurs, but that can only happen after the Vancouver Summit that will establish much of NATO's policy."
krg_nato.2.a: "Send out the invitations!"

krg_nato.3.t: "Canada Invites us to the Vancouver Summit"
krg_nato.3.d: "The Vancouver Summit, to be held in the eponymous Canadian city, is to be a gathering of American nations with strong ties to Canada. As we work to form the North American Trade Organization (NATO), we should look to advance our own interests over those of the two other American successors. Economic prosperity and security is all very good, but we'd much prefer it to not be at our expense. Still, optimism is in the air as we approach the date of the summit: NATO has the potential to bring jobs to our people and money to our economy."
krg_nato.3.a: "Let's head up north!"

krg_nato.4.t: "American Successors propose Anti-Union State Pact"
krg_nato.4.d: "On the first day of the conference, all three American successor states made it clear what their primary objective in Vancouver was: a renewal of economic health, but especially to the detriment of the forebodingly powerful Union State. The initial deal proposed was a complete severance of any economic ties, but this was later watered down somewhat to a more flexible proposal. Any trade deals offered to the Union State by Canada must first be offered to each of the successors; if multiple successors accepted, a bidding war would begin. Not a single CAD can pass the border without us declining it first! Obviously, no successor would ever want to negotiate with the government in New Orleans, so we needn't have a clause for that eventuality. "
krg_nato.4.a: "An excellent measure!"

krg_nato.5.t: "Canada Proposes the Joint Projects Committee"
krg_nato.5.d: "In order for NATO to accomplish greater goals of construction within its territory, such as the recently planned St. Lawrence Seaway to facilitate passage of ships, Canada suggests a Joint Projects Committee be established with two delegates from each nation. It can approve projects suggested by any country within NATO, and give support for their completion. Whether it's money, construction materials, or some other form of support, they'll make all the world impressed with NATO's achievements. Provided, of course, that said achievements are in the best interest of every member. "
krg_nato.5.a: "As long as we benefit from the projects..."

krg_nato.6.t: "The Pacific States Proposes the Goal of a Free Trade Zone"
krg_nato.6.d: "As a country with a large economy, engaging in a great deal of trade, it's hardly surprising that the Pacific States should want to create a free trade zone amongst NATO members. Nonetheless, it's a big step to take with an idea that was nothing but a dream of a few Parliamentarians a short while ago. In light of that fact, it's been decided that this plan should be tabled until all countries feel ready to calibrate their economies to this new suggestion. It has, however, been set forth as a goal of NATO to create that at some point - perhaps once all other concerns have been dealt with, and the world is stabilized to Ottawa's liking."
krg_nato.6.a: "This would be a big step forward."

krg_nato.40.t: "The First Dispute"
krg_nato.40.d: "Surprisingly, the summit's first direct conflict was not amongst the successor states; rather, it was the Commonwealth of New England and Canada who clashed.\n\nWhile not strictly a trade issue, the problem of competing fishing interests has made relations cool. Both countries send their fishing boats to shoals off the coast of the Maritimes, with New England justifying this with their greater population which must be fed. Canadian diplomats have retorted that, surely, a country with such resources can find alternative methods. Some possible solutions have been proposed: ensuring the purely domestic consumption of New England-caught fish, extending the Canadian sovereign waters, or creating a new concept - an Exclusive Economic Zone, in first drafts held by only Canada but later established as a potentially global concept, in which nations within a certain distance of an area are able to hold their rights against any others without dominion there. The idea, though formalizing what has been part of many countries' policies, is too radical to succeed right now in a world of less-than-harmonious national feeling. The issue has ultimately been tabled - "canned," as one newspaper quipped - until there can be global agreement on its use. "
krg_nato.40.a: "Let's pickle that."

krg_nato.7.t: "Canada Proposes Joint Foreign Policy Objectives"
krg_nato.7.d: "As the conference is drawing to a close, Canada has proposed what seems to be her flagship objective of the summit - joint foreign policy initiatives, to be carried out without reservation by all members. While support for this is certainly widespread, the countries agree that an impartial Special Council of NATO Objectives is to be established. This will oversee the authorization of, and planning for, any specific policies that will be taken. An important point is that a goal pursued by one country does not necessarily become a NATO objective - all countries need to agree in order for it to be pursued. Countries hostile to NATO members, while showing no signs of changing their policies, have begun to reconsider the situation with this new alliance."
krg_nato.7.a: "This isnt the Accord, but it is still worth consideration."

krg_nato.8.t: "Princess Elizabeth Closes the NATO conference"
krg_nato.8.d: "At last, with all deals made and goals established, regulations written and plans finalized, the Vancouver Summit is at an end. NATO has been established and ratified by all members; the North American Trade Organization can now begin to create greater prosperity throughout the attending countries. With great pomp, Princess Elizabeth has closed out the conference, concluding with a speech many attending greatly appreciated. Pledging her "whole life" to "the service of our great imperial family," it was felt to be a resonant statement at a time when the "great imperial family" faced global struggles. "
krg_nato.8.a: "She will make an excellent Queen one day."

krg_nato.9.t: "The Reduction of Coal Tariffs Passes NATO"
krg_nato.9.d: "A historic moment for the North American Trade Organization (NATO), as the representatives of California, Great Lakes, Canada, and New England have all universally agreed to an abolishment of tariffs between the participating countries, and an introduction of new regulations to prevent discriminatory trade practices. By their actions, NATO hopes to build cooperation between the countries of North America and build economic dependency that would in the words of one diplomat “make war on the North American Continent not only unthinkable, but materially impossible!""
krg_nato.9.a: "Excellent"

krg_nato.10.t: "New England Starts Construction of the St.Lawrence Canal"
krg_nato.10.d: "Important news out of New England today as the President along with the Govenor of New York have officially launched the construction of their section of the St. Lawrence Canal. Utilising the latest in engineer practises and the immense wealth and skill of New England they hope to have their half of the Canal open in no time and expect the canal to create significant economic growth and closer ties between the nations of the Great Lakes."
krg_nato.10.a: "A important step towards economic security."

krg_nato.11.t: "Canada Starts Construction of the St.Lawrence Canal"
krg_nato.11.d: "Canada has today officially started construction of their half of the St. Lawrence Canal. The Govenor-General, along with the Prime Minister and many cabinet members have had an extensive site tour, being shown the path of the canal system and location of the new facilities to support the canal. The Canadian Government hopes that the completion of the canal will help strengthen the ties between themselves and their Southern Allies and help Canada maintain its impressive economic growth."
krg_nato.11.a: "God speed to them."

krg_nato.12.t: "New England Continues Construction of the St.Lawrence Canal"
krg_nato.12.d: "With the groundwork already laid out, NATO co-founder New England has begun its contribution for the St. Lawrence Canal. The New Englanders are responsible for what is considered the ‘International Section’ of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Project which starts at the crossing of Cornwall, Ontario, and Massena, New York, and extends through to Lake Ontario. Two ceremonies were held to herald the beginning of American construction on the project. New England’s Secretary of Commerce oversaw a groundbreaking ceremony at the Bertrand H. Snell Lock while the Governor of Upstate New York was given a tour of the site chosen for the Raymond Baldwin Lock farther inland. These two locks will manage the bulk of the height differential for the seaway project. With two NATO leaders pitching in, public opinion on the project has hit an all-time high."
krg_nato.12.a: "It helps the economy!"


krg_nato.13.t: "Canada continues Construction of the St.Lawrence Canal"
krg_nato.13.d: "Further progress has been made on the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence Canal as the bulk of the sea level portion is nearing completion. With the Lower Pool finished, Canadian funding for the project is now being focused on the completion of the Upper and Lower Beauhanois Locks and the beginning of the Iroquois Lock. A minor upset in the project occurred, however, as Canadian Government officials insisted on imposing tolls on the canal to offset the cost. Construction on either side of the canal has not been interrupted, but New England’s representatives threatened to pull out of the project over the matter. Thus Far, the toll issue has been put to rest and the St. Lawrence Canal is still operating on schedule."
krg_nato.13.a: "NATO should be bringing us closer together, right?"

krg_nato.14.t: "Great Lakes Government submits their payment for the Construction of the St.Lawrence Canal"
krg_nato.14.d: "After a drawn-out series of deliberations and fundraising initiatives, the Great Lakes Government has finally submitted their portion of funding for the St. Lawrence Canal. While the Great Lakes Government controls a considerable portion of the former America’s industry, its economy has been hamstrung by the devastation from the revolution and its reliance on Canadian economic support. As such, the GLG’s economy is expected to benefit significantly from the completion of the St. Lawrence Canal by allowing free shipping between Detroit and the Atlantic. Great Laker tools, automobiles, and agricultural exports will be able to much more cheaply be sold across the Accord market.\n\nThe Great Lakes Government, however, is still in a period of economic recovery, and procuring cash for funding has been difficult. This hurdle was finally overcome in Great Lakes Congress with a combination of smart budgeting and minor loans from the New England government. While the St. Lawrence Canal itself is situated within the domains of Canada and New England, the Great Laker contribution will be used to fund construction on the Lake Ontario Level section of Canal and cover the over budget costs of the Iroquois Lock started by the Canadians. The NATO approval for St. Lawrence funding did not initially require a significant Great Laker contribution, but their government wished to both assert its position as an equal NATO partner and to convince Canada to drop the toll. Free trade in and out of the Great Lakes would benefit the GLG greatly."
krg_nato.14.a: "I didnt know their money was worth anything"

krg_nato.15.t: "St.Lawrence Canal Completed"
krg_nato.15.d: "The St. Lawrence Canal has finally been completed after several years of debate, planning, and construction! The Canal itself only stretches from Montreal Harbour to Lake Ontario, but with the additional dredging of the Welland Canal, it unlocks shipping across the entirety of the Great Lakes. Now goods will be able to flow freely from Milwaukee and Detroit into the Atlantic and across the globe. The GLG is not the only beneficiary and Canada has now given Toronto, Hamilton, and the rest of their Great Lakes cities a much more direct avenue to global trade. Meanwhile New England benefits from economically enriched allies in Canada and Great Lakes, as well as improved shipping in and out of Buffalo and Rochester. The completion of the canal has unlocked the potential of a greater St. Lawrence Seaway that will greatly improve the economies of the Northeastern American continent.\n\nEven though the St. Lawrence Canal project was explicitly a project for its three primary beneficiaries (Canada, GLG, New England) it was one of the first major projects voted on and completed as part of the greater NATO project. Representatives from the Pacific States and other NATO nations joined the three beneficiaries in Montreal to mark the official opening of the St. Lawrence Canal. The affair was celebrated with champagne and a series of speeches boasting the success of the NATO project and the power of cooperation between free nations. That evening, a telegram was sent to the NATO offices in Ottawa citing permission for a vessel out of Cleveland, Ohio bearing the Union State flag. The request remains unanswered which the Longist government has taken as proof that NATO was founded as a tool against them."
krg_nato.15.a: "Through their powers combined: The St. Lawrence Seaway!"



krg_nato.38.t: "NATO and the Caribbean"
krg_nato.38.d: "The North American Trade Organization was created as a means to facilitate trade between the free American governments and our allies in Canada. To that end, it has been serving us well so far by streamlining customs measures and lowering barriers to trade. By pooling our resources together, we have been able to leverage the strength of our economies to gain a serious edge against our rivals near home and abroad. But as Canada keeps its sights set on Britain and France, we have an opportunity to utilize NATO as a tool to expand our own influence across the Americas. The Caribbean is a major source of agricultural goods that most of NATO’s founders cannot grow and would open up more markets for us to export our industrial goods in exchange. Meanwhile, each member would gain an equal vote on NATO’s council meaning that they could steer future infrastructure investments into their own countries. Our advisors have compiled a list of amenable NATO nominees that could best help the organization grow:\n\nPuerto Rico: For better or worse, America has a long history tied to Puerto Rico, and we know that their economy is powered by agriculture, textiles, and chemical exports. Sugar, rum, and coffee are of particular interest to us and we have a lot to gain exporting power tools to grow their industrial boom.  New England has a significant Puerto Rican population and we hope to find common ground to entice them to join us at the table as equals for the first time.\n\nJamaica: Newly independent Jamaica has a lot to offer NATO’s markets. The typical Caribbean cash crops like sugar and banana are enticing, but the real draw of Jamaica is its significant Bauxite and Alumina (Aluminum Oxide) deposits. Bauxite and Alumina are fantastic sources of component materials in the production of Aluminum which is increasingly vital for our advancing weapons technology. Meanwhile, Jamaica’s rapidly growing population has a growing demand for grains and transport machinery - two things we can easily provide.\n\nTrinidad: Oil is the name of the game in Trinidad. They are eager to export it and NATO has the experts required to develop its industry to fuel our growing demand for petroleum.\n\nCuba: Cuban tourism is particularly attractive to our citizens, but the real draw is Oil, Nickel, and Citrus. Additionally, restoring close ties to Cuba might help us renegotiate pre-civil war leasing rights with their government. Bases in the Caribbean would be a huge leg up against the Longists."
krg_nato.38.a: "Puerto Rico"
krg_nato.38.b: "Jamaica"
krg_nato.38.c: "Trinidad"
krg_nato.38.e: "Cuba"

krg_nato.39.t: "New England Invites us to join NATO"
krg_nato.39.d: "The US Ambassador from New England came before our government today with an expected offer: to join the North American Trade Organization. By joining NATO, we would be agreeing to enter a powerful trade deal that will give us better access to American and Canadian industries and a vote on their council. Some members of our administration support this proposal as we have potentially a lot more to gain by playing the New Englanders’ game. While NATO is no military treaty, it would certainly not hurt to have a few naval powers watching our backs in case this cold war gets hot as well.\n\nAnti-Accordist members of our government oppose this because they believe joining NATO could drag us into a European war. We can leverage our independence to trade with more markets like the Reichspakt and American Union State, but neither of them are offering as good of a deal as New England just laid before us. Still, we are a sovereign nation and are not at the whim of imperialists and colonial masters - the choice to join NATO is firmly in our hands."
krg_nato.39.a: "Of Course"
krg_nato.39.b: "No"

krg_nato.41.t: "NATO and Central America"
krg_nato.41.d: "Slowly but surely, NATO has begun to expand with our government at the helm. With Caribbean expansion cruising along, we can now look into expanding NATO presence into Central America. The Central American region has had its share of stability issues in the past decades, but this is all the more reason to increase our presence there. Our primary expectations lie in cash crops and agricultural exports though mineral extractions are growing in this region as well. By inviting Central American nations to NATO, we can secure many of the resources we lost to the Union State in the war. The top Central American nominees for NATO membership are:\n\nPanama: While Canada controls the canal zone, securing stronger economic ties with Panama will only strengthen NATO’s position in the region. Additionally, Panamanian shrimp exports are highly desirable right now, and bringing them into the organization can secure our interests for the duration of this cold war.\n\nCosta Rica: The Costa Rican economy is propped up by coffee and banana plantations. These two crops are perennially desired by our citizens and should be relatively easy to procure a trade deal for.\n\nCentroamerica: Centroamerica is the major player in the region and is constantly at knife’s edge. If we can convince their government to join NATO we can offer infrastructure investments and arms deals to strengthen their position in exchange for the plethora of cattle, precious metals, and cash crops that their economy has to offer us."

krg_nato.41.b: "Costa Rica"
krg_nato.41.c: "Centroamerica"

krg_nato.42.t: "NATO and South America"
krg_nato.42.d: "South America is the final frontier for NATO expansion. Firmly beyond the north, bringing South America into the fold will transform NATO into a truly pan-American organization. More than ever, we will begin stepping on the toes of the Reichspakt's interests as we venture to expand our influence to our southern neighbors. And while our focus will be on existing trade partners, we cannot dismiss the fact that South America may very well be a battleground at some point. South American countries are much larger and more capable than those of the Caribbean and Central America - any that we invite may be much more capable of swaying the NATO Council on future decisions due to their stronger economies. Still, we have a lot to gain from expanding into South America so here are the NATO nominees:\n\nColombia: The Colombian economy is a tough nut to crack with its primary export being coffee. If we can get them to agree to open their market, we can begin exporting heavy machinery to improve their mining and agricultural output. Growing Colombia’s economy may increase their output and their desire for imports. Swaying them away from Mitteleuropean trade may be more beneficial in the short term, however.\n\nVenezuela: Oil is king in Venezuela, and we need to earn its favor. Thus far, Venezuela has been happy to sell to both sides of this cold war but Germany has been developing a special relationship with the AUS and Texan oil. Securing a trade deal for Venezuelan oil would drastically improve our energy situation. We can offer arms, ships, pharmaceuticals - whatever it takes to convince Venezuela to sell to the NATO markets!\n\nBrazil: Possibly the largest country to be invited into NATO yet, Brazil is a massive untapped market for us to integrate. Coffee and cattle products, plus lumber of minerals are just a portion of what Brazil has to offer. Giving them the vehicles and equipment they need to buoy their economy against the rising Argentinian threat can help secure our interests on the continent in the long term.\n\nGuyana: Guyana is one of the youngest countries on the continent but it has much to offer NATO. Their massive bauxite deposits may be able to support the entirety of NATO’s needs. Furthermore, their economy is rounded off by gold, rice, and sugar. They can become a vital, loyal, and stable member of NATO if they agree to join!"

krg_nato.42.b: "Venezuela"
krg_nato.42.c: "Brazil"
krg_nato.42.e: "Guyana"
