# Industry
industry_folder: "Industry"
industry_folder_desc: "Industrial research and development"
construction_1: "Construction I"
construction_1_desc: "The widespread usage of new technologies and methods, such as tracked bulldozers and steel frame buildings, boosted the construction sector before the Second Weltkrieg. When the United States was engulfed in its socio-economic quagmire, European construction rapidly expanded. From the simplistic workers' clubs in Paris to the gigantic factories of Yekaterinburg, the European construction sector had pushed the boundaries of efficiency and aesthetics to a new level."
construction_2: "Construction II"
construction_2_desc: "By the end of the war, many countries rising from the ruins were overwhelmed by the extensive demands of reconstruction. Fortunately, millions of veterans flooding into the labour market provided abundant labor forces. Buildings of this era focused on cost-efficiency, quantity, and speed, adopting unpretentious utilitarianism through prefabricated structures and brutalist concrete designs."
construction_3: "Construction III"
construction_3_desc: "As the Figl and Montgomery plans began to take effect, the war-torn nations of the West began to recover. The new era of prosperity created even more demands on construction, most notably the ambitious infrastructure projects in the Americas and urban renewal projects in Europe. The construction industry of this era adopted lightweight, mass-produced materials, such as glass and steel, to build radically simple constructions, giving rise to a new wave of modernist architecture."
construction_4: "Construction IV"
construction_4_desc: "While the post-war boom ended and the Third Weltkrieg loomed on the horizon, the construction sector began to cool down. With the winds of change challenging old social hierarchies, previous rigid doctrines, and oppressive architectural uniformity were also thwarted. Meanwhile, newcomers joined the fray from Tokyo to Cairo and Wuhan to Manaus, challenging the Western domination of modern architecture. As the Kalterkrieg heated up, what were the construction industry's prospects?"
aluminium_refining_1: "Aluminum Refining I"
aluminium_refining_1_desc: "The development of 2024 and 6061 aluminum alloys by the Alcoa corporation in the 1930's allowed for the rapid expansion of aluminum applications in aeronautics. These new materials offered excellent stress resistance, high-tensile strength, and, most importantly, ease of manufacture and processing. With the downfall of Alcoa in the Second American Civil War, patents on affordable production of cutting-edge aluminum alloys spread rapidly worldwide."
aluminium_refining_2: "Aluminum Refining II"
aluminium_refining_2_desc: "During the Second Weltkrieg, the demand for military aircraft boosted demands in Aluminum, incentivized innovations on extraction. The many countries adopted aluminium recycling programs, many of whom was inspired by the practices of the Union of Britain since 1940."
aluminium_refining_3: "Aluminum Refining III"
aluminium_refining_3_desc: "The introduction of the household appliance industry, lightweight ground vehicles, and advanced aeronautics created new demands for aluminum production, resulting in the excavation of new mines, most notably in Guyana, Australasia and Brazil. Moreover, molten metal filtration for removing particulate contamination in Aluminium was introduced to improve refinery yields. As the industry expanded, would aluminium become the metal of the future?" 
factory_upgrade_1: "Improved Factory I"
factory_upgrade_1_desc: "The rapid advancement of manufacturing since the 1900's demanded new manufacturing management methods, most notably Fordism. Based on the extreme specialization of tasks and a deep technical division of labor within the workplace, Fordism requests workers to perform simple, repetitive, de-skilled tasks with only seconds of task cycles on streamlines. Despite dehumanizing working conditions and the alienation of workers from their tasks, Fordism dominated factory management for the first half of the twentieth century."
factory_upgrade_2: "Improved Factory II"
factory_upgrade_2_desc: "The 1950's marked the introduction of statistical and psychological methods into manufacturing management. New Englander engineer Joseph Juran emphasized the genuine commitment of top-level management to quality. Union statistician W. Edwards Deming envisioned the manufacturing process as a seamless whole rather than the sum of incongruent parts. While rejected by many traditional industries in the West, newcomers across the Pacific quickly adopted these new methods."
factory_upgrade_3: "Improved Factory III"
factory_upgrade_3_desc: "As time progressed to the 1960's, Fordism of old was under siege. Taiichi Ohno in Japan introduced the Toyota Production System, which minimized inventory and waste through flexible production lines and dynamic warehousing. Chinese Engineer Song Bida reinvented syndicalist workplace democracies in his Anshan Steel Constitution, emphasizing the total integration of workers, engineers, and management to incentivize productivity and innovation. Will these practices of decentralized decision-making, learning organizations, and holistic thinking practices outperform the tested methods in the West?"
building_capacity_upgrade_1: "Land Cultivation I"
building_capacity_upgrade_1_desc: "By the end of the Second Weltkrieg, global food safety was at stake. European and North American agriculture was severely disrupted despite technological prowess, causing famines and unrest. For the rest of the world, traditional subsistence farming could not feed their growing population. Moreover, environmental crises, such as America's dust storms and China's deforestation, further undermined the food supply. Facing threats of starvation, people across the world made extensive efforts to revive agricultural production. "
building_capacity_upgrade_2: "Land Cultivation II"
building_capacity_upgrade_2_desc: "The landscape of western agriculture was forever changed by cheap fertilizers, partly due to the conversion of wartime chemical production capacity, partly due to a deeper scientific understanding of the importance of nutrients. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, various land redistribution agendas, whether radical or moderate, have led to increasing agricultural outputs, high rural purchasing power, and social mobility, paving the way for future development. "
building_capacity_upgrade_3: "Land Cultivation III"
building_capacity_upgrade_3_desc: "The Green Revolution, pioneered by Union agronomist Norman Borlaug in the late 1950's, was an attempt to prevent socialist resurgence in the underdeveloped world. However, it also took agriculture to a new level, significantly increasing yields and agricultural output. With the spread of advanced agricultural technologies, farmers worldwide began to adopt high-yielding crops, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, controlled irrigation, and mechanization. While often accompanied by political demands in exchange, the Green Revolution managed to feed hundreds of millions of people."
chromium_extraction_1: "Chromium Extraction I"
chromium_extraction_1_desc: " Chromium is an important metal used in stainless steel. For a long time, its refinery had followed a process of roasting with leaching and precipitation to extract chromate compounds, followed by reduction to obtain metallic Chromium. During the Second Weltkrieg, this shining metal was vital to producing various alloys used on advanced engines and armor plates."
chromium_extraction_2: "Chromium Extraction II"
chromium_extraction_2_desc: "After the Second Weltkrieg, chromium soon found its usage in everyday life. For consumers, these shiny, corrosion-resistant surfaces were aesthetically and functionally desirable. Soon, chrome trims on household appliances and chrome bumpers on cars became popular in the West. These new demands had all fostered the chromium industry to expand."
chromium_extraction_3: "Chromium Extraction III"
chromium_extraction_3_desc: "During the Kalterkrieg, Chromium found its usage in high-performance alloys, also known as superalloys, serving as the secondary ingredient after the iron/nickel/cobalt base. Since superalloys were vital for advanced jet engines' turbine blades and combustion chambers, their production and exchanges soon became closely guarded secrets. What aeronautic marvels will superalloys bring about in the future?"
dockyard_upgrade_1: "Improved Dockyard I"
dockyard_upgrade_1_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg saw the widespread use of advanced shipbuilding techniques, most notably the Hull Block Construction Method (HBCM). To fulfill the enormous shipbuilding demands to invade Britain, Canadian, and New Englander shipyards divided ship designs into many chunks, or "blocks", fabricating and outfitting them in workshops before assembling them in the shipyards. This method not only accelerated construction but also simplified quality management."
dockyard_upgrade_2: "Improved Dockyard II"
dockyard_upgrade_2_desc: "Containerization revolutionized cargo shipping in the 1950s, leading to a new type of civilian vessel: container ships. This trend was pioneered by Malcom McLean, who was the first to profit from container ships converted from wartime oil tankers. Since then, shipbuilders have launched purpose-built container ships facing new demands. On the military side, another new naval technology arms race began when New Englander admiral Hyman G. Rickover introduced the world's first nuclear submarine, Nautilus. This powerful yet dangerous method of propulsion allowed naval engineers to create previously unimaginable vessels."
dockyard_upgrade_3: "Improved Dockyard III"
dockyard_upgrade_3_desc: " The 1960's saw fierce competition in the global shipbuilding industry. The days when New England, Britain, Germany, and Sweden dominated over two-thirds of the world's shipbuilding output were gone. Now, their relative share had been overtaken by new players in Asia, whose prices were lower than those of the West by a margin that ranged from 7.5-20%, thanks to lower cost factors of production, successful industrial policies, greater innovativeness, and efficient management. Will these new names, such as Mitsubishi, Jiangnan, and Hanjin dominate future shipbuilding?" 
early_industrial_techniques: "Early Industrial Techniques"
early_industrial_techniques_desc: "Hand tools before industrialization were not much different than 1,500 years ago. Although simple and inexpensive, they could not create standardized, precise products. It is said that when Henry Mudslay built the first modern lathe for tapping screws, he spent a decade achieving a satisfactory standard spindle. Such inefficient methods were unsuitable in the contemporary age. As the demand for precision metal parts such as pistons, gears, and cylinders increased, early machine tools such as metal planers, milling machines, and turret lathes also appeared. "
basic_machine_tools: "Basic Machine Tools"
basic_machine_tools_desc: "In the 19th-20th centuries, machine tools evolved into specialized apparatus with a specific task ubiquitous to many industries, paving ways for standardization, interchangeability and, economy of scale. Henry Ford's application of interchangeable parts and assembly line techniques in the production of automobiles revolutionized manufacturing, allowing for mass production and reduced costs. Moreover, the increasing availability and reliability of electric motors during this period led to the electrification of many tools, replacing older mechanisms driven by belt and line shafts, resulting in a more consistent machining processes."
improved_machine_tools: "Improved Machine Tools"
improved_machine_tools_desc: " In the post-war years, manufacturing technology advanced by leaps and bounds. One notable example was the invention of electron beam welding by the German physicist Karl-Heinz Steigerwald in 1949. This method could join metals with unprecedented precision, satisfying the need for strong, precise welds in the aerospace and automobile industries. Another example was ultrasonic machining, using ultrasonic vibrations of abrasive materials to remove material from workpieces, particularly useful for brittle materials and complex shapes."
advanced_machine_tools: "Advanced Machine Tools"
advanced_machine_tools_desc: "The most groundbreaking innovation in manufacturing of this era was the CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining introduced by the Great Lakes engineers John Parsons and Frank Stulen in 1952. This method used automatically controlled cutting tools to remove material from workpieces, allowing for the repeatable manufacturing of complex and precise shapes that could not be manufactured with traditional manual milling techniques with little human intervention. As computer and robotics technology advance, will future factories become intelligent"
excavation_1: "Excavation I"
excavation_1_desc: "From the days of medieval salt industries, most mines used hand tools like picks and shovels. The introduction of undercutting machines in the 1900's and loading machines in the 1920's drastically improved mining efficiency. However, these innovations were only used by major mines in the most industrialized countries, while the rest of the world still relied on hand tools."
excavation_2: "Excavation II"
excavation_2_desc: "During the late 1940's, conventional room-and-pillar techniques began to be replaced by continuous miners that can break off minerals from the working face and transfer them back to the haulage system uninterrupted. This system was pioneered in 1948 by the Joy Ripper, the first continuous miner applicable to the room-and-pillar method developed in Milwaukee, Great Lakes."
excavation_3: "Excavation III"
excavation_3_desc: "The extraction industry developed rapidly in the 1950's with revolutionary technologies such as bucket wheel excavators (BWE), the largest land-based machinery humanity ever built. First built by Krupp for lignite mines near Cologne, these towering machines were larger and heavier than naval cruisers and could efficiently cut a swath of over 180 m (600 ft) at a time. Moreover, safety in mining operations received greater attention during this period. The United Kingdom was among the first to use self-rescuers adapted from syndicalist regulations. Union company E.D. Bullard Co. developed the first hard hat in thermoplastic in 1952."
excavation_4: "Excavation IV"
excavation_4_desc: "The 1960s would see demand in the restoration of war-torn mines across the Americas and African continent. Continuous miners, roof and rock bolting, long-hole drilling operations, and even Geiger counters would become industrial standards. Moreover, the labor wave created by decolonization prompted mining companies to introduce "industrial statesmanship" in the late 1950's. This aimed to show how enterprise benefits the individual, the community, and the nation. Could the industry revert its public image of exploitation and pollution?
free_civ_factories_1: "Civilian Economy I"
free_civ_factories_1_desc: "While most of Europe and North America had experienced extensive destruction and deaths, no battles had been fought on the soils of Canada and Danubia. Both countries were put in uniquely powerful positions to spearhead reconstruction efforts. The rest of the devastated West had to spend the immediate postwar decade undergoing extensive reconstruction, heavily dependent on aid from both countries, namely the Montgomery and Figl Plans."
free_civ_factories_2: "Civilian Economy II"
free_civ_factories_2_desc: "After the reconstruction period, many countries in the West experienced a significant rise in fertility rate. This \"Baby Boom\" period marked an era of economic prosperity and increased consumerism. From San Francisco to Warsaw, the demands for residence, vehicles, and household appliances skyrocketed, followed by the flourishing services sector, most notably as education, schooling, and tourism.""
free_civ_factories_3: "Civilian Economy III"
free_civ_factories_3_desc: "The 1960's were a time of significant changes. As the baby boom cooled, countries introduced new methods to foster economic growth, such as the demand-side economics of increased governmental spending and the supply-side methods of tax cuts. On the other hand, Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India rapidly industrialized, while the emerging countries in former colonies sought their place in the global market. Will they be able to challenge the economic domination of the West?"
steelmaking_1: "Steelmaking I"
steelmaking_1_desc: "Steel is the bread and butter of industrialization. Since the 19th century, the dominating method of steelmaking had been the open-hearth process. Its procedures involve a series of batches, or "heats," during which scrap metals are melted in burning gas and slag-forming agents. Despite its adaptability to scrap metals, its long cycle became a significant obstacle to increasing steel yield. "
steelmaking_2: "Steelmaking II"
steelmaking_2_desc: " Although the booming steel industry slowed down after the war, its innovations did not. The most important invention of the time was Basic Oxygen Steelmaking(BOS), a new method involving adding oxygen and basic fluxes during the steelmaking process. Introduced by Swiss engineer Robert Durrer and commercialized in Danubia, BOS had proven its ability to cut total cycle time to a small fraction of the open hearth process, thus significantly reducing energy and labor for a given metal mix."
steelmaking_3: "Steelmaking III"
steelmaking_3_desc: "With the expansion of the automobile industry and large-scale application of steel-framed construction, the steel industry had ushered in a new wave of development. Innovations such as continuous casting further enhanced the yield of steel production, guaranteed quality, and reduced energy and time consumption. However, as glass, aluminium, and plastics popularized, could steel re-assert its dominance?"
tungsten_mining_1: "Tungsten Mining I"
tungsten_mining_1_desc: "Tungsten is a vital industrial metal with a variety of usage from lathe cutting tools to armor-piercing ammunitions. Since Robert Oxland's 1847 patent, tungsten metallurgy has been largely empirical and mainly based upon separated patents, such as decomposition with bisulfate, roasting with carbonates, or decomposing with ammonia. "
tungsten_mining_2: "Tungsten Mining II"
tungsten_mining_2_desc: " Based on the methods proposed before the 1950's, treating tungsten ores by hydrochloric acid or nitric acid was developed. Despite its improvement in yield and cost-effectiveness, the hydrochloric acid decomposition process could only apply to scheelite ores with little impurities, while inappropriate for wolframite or other tungsten ores with a high impurity content. "
tungsten_mining_3: "Tungsten Mining III"
tungsten_mining_3_desc: " With the development of industrial technologies, solvent extraction (SX) has been introduced into the tungsten industry in 1959. The method involves using large amounts of soda or caustic soda to produce a soluble sodium tungstate solution. However, this requires high pressures and temperatures, a significant excess of chemicals, and generating tons of high-salinity wastewater. As tungsten demand soars, modern metallurgists are developing cleaner and more efficient alternatives. Could the tungsten industry become more environmental-friendly?"
