olympics.0.t: "Agreement Reached for '52 Olympiad"
olympics.0.d: "With the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the International Olympic Committee met in Stockholm, Sweden to discuss the upcoming 1952 Olympics. After long discussions, the German, Canadian, Danubian, and French delegations have finally reached an agreement..\n\nThe Agreement states that the 1952 Summer Olympics will be held in Berlin, Germany and the 1952 Winter Olympics will be held in Montreal, Canada. French officials attempted to try and hold the Winter Olympics in the French Alps, but the IOC determined that reconstruction has moved too slowly and settled on Montreal as the final selection.\n\nJostling has already begun over the 1956 Olympic games, with the Danubians keen to show their unity as a nation, and the French ready to show they have recovered from the war."
olympics.0.a: "We must prepare for this!"
olympics.0.b: "At least they can agree on that..."
