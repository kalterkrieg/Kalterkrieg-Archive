### Generic Events ###
NuclearEvents.1.t: "Horror in [From.From.GetName]" 
NuclearEvents.1.d: "According to [Root.GetAdjective] military staff, [From.From.GetName] has been the site of a nuclear detonation. Although not the first use of this weapon the world has seen, it remains a shocking and horrifying occurrence as the world enters an age of unprecedented use of this weapon. While there had been hope that such a device would never be used again, especially on a civilian target, it seems the rules of war have been irreversibly altered."
NuclearEvents.1.a: "Where will it be used next?"
NuclearEvents.1.b: "Maybe I should invest in a shelter..."
