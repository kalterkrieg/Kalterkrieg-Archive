 covert_supply_routes: "Covert Supply Routes"
 covert_supply_routes_desc: "One cannot simply drive a truck down the road, or load a train with guns as the occupier does. A degree of covert supply must therefore be done, either by nearby neutral states, underground tunnels, disguises or even dissassembly and hiding them amongst other goods. The smuggler keeps the bullets moving."
 integrated_paramilitaries: "Integrated Paramilitaries"
 integrated_paramilitaries_desc: "As the movement grows in strength, it must also grow in coordination, integrating the paramilitary movements in order to further the aims of the political leadership.

 air_skirmish: "Air Skirmish"

 logistical_bombing_desc: "A greater focus on attacking the enemy's supply lines from the air gives a greater advantage to our own ground forces in the area."
 battlefield_support: "Battlefield Support"
 battlefield_support_desc: "It is difficult for Tactical bombers to attack targets near where our ground forces are in combat, since level bombing is less accurate than dive bombing, but more training and interaction with ground-based observers can help to overcome these problems."
 carousel_bombing: "Carousel Bombing"
 carousel_bombing_desc: "Bombers often simply want to dump all their bombs as soon they reach their target area and then fly home as soon as possible. While this can work for area-bombing, when it comes to hitting a small target it is more effective to linger over the target, dropping only a portion of their bomb load at a time for maximum accuracy."
