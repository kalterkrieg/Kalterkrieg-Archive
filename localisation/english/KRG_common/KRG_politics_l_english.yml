 ### Ideology Descriptions ###
 
 ### Authoritarian Socialism ###
 authoritarian_socialist_subtype_desc: "§YAuthoritarian Socialism§!, as the name suggests, is a catch-all term for all vanguardists, blanquists, \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" socialist movements, who have stuck to an ideological commitment to revolution in the midst of the Third Internationale's defeat.\n\nThus though the ideology is broad, all Authoritarians Socialists have a few common tenets they adhere to. First is the rapid and total socialisation of society, brought about by an all-encompassing social revolution. This could be violent or peaceful, but must be structurally transformative in its goals. The next is abolishing a capitalist wage-based economy to implement socialist modes of production, though the specifics of an implemented socialist economy vary from country to country. This can manifest in many forms, but tends towards a strong executive or legislature, and notions such as democratic centralism in opposition to 'liberal-bourgeois' voting. Increasingly, Authoritarian Socialist regimes have tended towards building 'Socialism in One Country' style rhetoric, and the renunciation of internationalistic \"Permanent Revolution\" to survive in the post-war world.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Authoritarian Socialists everywhere is to establish a paradise led by the proletariat, for the proletariat. The extent to which that utopian goal is successful varies."

 ### Radical Socialism ###
 radical_socialist_subtype_desc: "§YRadical Socialism§!, as the name suggests, is a catch-all term for all libertarian socialist movements, including Syndicalism, Anarchism and others, who have stuck to an ideological commitment to revolution in the midst of the Third Internationale's defeat.\n\nThus though the ideology is broad, all Radical Socialists have a few common tenets they adhere to. First is the rapid and total socialisation of society, brought about by an all-encompassing social revolution. This could be violent or peaceful, but must be structurally transformative in its goals. The next is abolishing a capitalist wage-based economy to implement socialist modes of production, though the specifics of an implemented socialist economy vary from country to country. Finally, Radical Socialists are opposed to \"Totalism\" and other authoritarian or vanguardist forms of socialism. This can manifest in many forms, ranging from radically decentralised libertarianism to forms of parliamentary democracy, but generally they always share a weak executive and some commitment to conventional democracy. Increasingly, Radical Socialist regimes have tended towards pacifism and the renunciation of internationalistic \"Permanent Revolution\" to survive in the hostile post-war world.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Radical Socialists everywhere is to establish a paradise led by the proletariat, for the proletariat. The extent to which that utopian goal is successful varies."

 ### Social Democracy ###
 social_democrat_subtype_desc: "While their roots lay in the revolutionary socialist movements of the early 20th Century, §YSocial Democracy§! is a much more moderate leftist ideology rooted in democracy and liberalism. Instead of agitating for revolution, Social Democrats instead advocate for an evolutionary, peaceful transition to socialism, within democratic political frameworks.\n\nSocial Democracy aims either to reform and humanize capitalism as an intermediary step towards a socialist society, or synthesize the two economic regimes. This is done through a regulated and interventionist mixed economy, being supportive of collective bargaining through moderate trade unionism. Social Democrats have retained their egalitarian, solidaristic outlooks, which is most obviously backed up by wealth redistribution policies and the promotion of robust welfare states to curb inequality and uplift underprivileged and impoverished groups.\n\nWith the downfall of the Third Internationale, many once revolutionary socialists have rapidly re-aligned themselves along reformist Social Democrat lines to fit into the new post-war political paradigm."

 social_democrat_longism_desc: "When Huey Long became the first President of the American Union State, America went through a politician revolution. No longer would the will of the politician or bureaucrat be the law of the land. Now the people, the working men and women, be the true rulers of America. Every American a king, yet nobody wears a crown. From this decree, Longism was founded. Longism is a mix of populist and nationalist policies combined with the democratic traditions of the former United States of America.\n\nProgressive Longists focus on the Share Our Wealth economic reforms as evidence that Huey Long was a progressive at heart. Progressive Longists will attempt to use populist and nationalist rhetoric to promote progressive social and economic changes. Progressive Longists are typically pro-economic reform and supportive of the Civil Rights Movement."
 social_democrat_american_progressivism_desc: "$social_democrat_subtype_desc$"


 ### Revolutionary Republicanism ###
 revolutionary_republican_subtype_desc: "§YRevolutionary Republicanism§!, as coined by Harvard Professor Arthur Holcombe in 1947, is an emerging political ideology. With the discrediting of Syndicalism and its various ideological derivatives with the Third Internationale's downfall, and the subsequent entrenchment of reactionary regimes with their roots in or before the Weltkrieg, politically radical currents were forced to shift. In this flux, the radically liberal ideology of Revolutionary Republicanism has come to fruition.\n\nRevolutionary Republicans draw a lot of ideological inspiration from pre-Weltkrieg Radicalism, however these ideas have been taken to more generally extreme positions. With their roots in social liberalism and moderate left-wing schools of thought, they champion parliamentarianism, social progress (sometimes including liberation of the sexes) and electoral freedom. Revolutionary Republicans are thus modernizers seeking to transform or replace the archaic principles of their respective nations. They are deeply opposed to reactionary and inert strands of conservatism, and often hold a civic nationalistic tone to their rhetoric. That said, more socially conservative messages of Revolutionary Republicanism do exist, so long as the movement is politically transformative. As Holcombe's term suggests, they are almost always anti-monarchist.\n\nAs the ideology is an emerging one, it remains to be seen if Revolutionary Republicanism will garner a long-lasting political tradition, or if the ideology will be relegated to the history books."

 ### Social Liberalism ###
 social_liberal_subtype_desc: "§YSocial Liberalism§! is the political philosophy that endorses a regulated market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights. Social Liberal thought holds that the common good is harmonious with the freedom of the individual. However the state's involvement is more muscular than in classical or market liberalism, with Social Liberals supporting state interventions in matters such as education, unemployment and health care. There are many strands of Social Liberal thought, some centering on the relation of Christian ethics within a political framework, some focusing on the issues faced by rural society in the age of urbanism and still others focussed more entirely on the extension of rights and freedoms to all with less interest in the economic and interventionist side of things beyond that progressive drive."

 social_liberal_american_progressivism_desc: "$social_liberal_subtype_desc$"

 ### Market Liberalism ###
 market_liberal_subtype_desc: "§YMarket Liberalism§! or Classical Liberalism as it is also known is the political school of thought that emerged in the mid 18th century and has thrived in varying forms ever since. It has a strong focus on individual and property rights as it originally sprung from the concerns of those bourgeois merchants of common birth who were uncomfortably squeezed by their feudal aristocratic overlords. A key feature of §YMarket Liberalism§! is that individual's rights are inalienable - that is the government cannot take them away. However the support of those rights and their commitment to letting free markets resolve issues does mean that Market Liberal states tend to have fewer interventions in matters of state support for individuals in matters such as health care, education and unemployment."

 market_liberal_american_republicanism_desc: "$market_liberal_subtype_desc$"

 ### Social Conservatism ###
 social_conservative_subtype_desc: "As its name would suggest, §YSocial Conservatism§! is a moderate right-wing political ideology centred around the preservation and conservation of traditional social values, attitudes and power dynamics through democratic systems. Opposed to radical change from either Socialist or Nationalist movements, Social Conservatives champion the preservation of a moderate and stable status-quo to ensure the orderly working of society.\n\nAs they primarily focus on social issues, Social Conservatives can vary quite a lot in their organisation and economic outlooks. Some Conservatives, especially within the Reichspakt, are politically elitist and aim to preserve the institutionally privileged position the ruling class has within their respective nations, however more populist, lower-class and strictly ideological interpretations of the ideology are common across the world. Traditionally, social conservatives have stood for protectionist, isolationist and austere economic doctrines however since the Weltkrieg, as the world has become increasingly interconnected by trade and political alliances, strands of more economically liberal conservatism has developed. Though conservative movements may use nationalist messaging and rhetoric to garner popular support, Social Conservatives tend not to be revanchist and expansionists as this would upset the status-quo."

 social_conservative_longism_desc: "When Huey Long became the first President of the American Union State, America went through a politician revolution. No longer would the will of the politician or bureaucrat be the law of the land. Now the people, the working men and women, be the true rulers of America. Every American a king, yet nobody wears a crown. From this decree, Longism was founded. Longism is a mix of populist and nationalist policies combined with the democratic traditions of the former United States of America.\n\nConservative Longists claim that Huey Long's reforms were a temporary measure to contain the chaos facing America in the first half of the 20th century. Conservatives claim that at his core, Huey Long was still a conservative, and have argued that Longism is truly about anti-socialism combined with both social and fiscal conservatism. Conservative Longists are typically anti-economic reform and against the Civil Rights Movement."
 social_conservative_toryism_desc: "$social_conservative_subtype_desc$"

 ### Authoritarian Democracy ###
 authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc: "An §YAuthoritarian Democracy§! is one that still believes in it's citizens, that they must be taken care of by their elected officials, guided into the right choices by the implementations of laws and restrictions. Authoritarian Democracy still respects mass politics, for that is the foundation of the mandate in order to rule. However they are aware that the people are sadly ignorant of many of the troubles that face their beloved country, and as such make no secret of their desire to legally manipulate the electoral system in such a way as to ensure that they remain in power while they resolve the issues that face the state. Perhaps one day the masses will be able to be trusted to resolve their own issues, but not today."

 authoritarian_democrat_longism_desc: "When Huey Long became the first President of the American Union State, America went through a political revolution. No longer would the will of the politician or bureaucrat be the law of the land, as they had been. Now, the people, the working men and women, be the true rulers of America. From the core decree, "Every man a king, yet no one wears a crown", Longism was founded. Longism is a mix of populist and nationalist policies combined with the democratic traditions of the former United States of America.\n\nOrthodox Longism is best described as a strict adherence to the policies and ideology of former President Huey Long, at least in spirit and rhetoric. Orthodox Longists are usually socially conservative and fiscally progressive, pushing for far-reaching economic reform while attempting to keep the status quo. Orthodox Longists are also typically pro-economic reform and neutral towards the Civil Rights Movement, with internal groups both backing and opposing it."
 authoritarian_democrat_jungkonservativen_desc: "$authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc$"

 ### Paternal Autocracy ###
 paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "§YPaternal Autocracy§! describes those political systems where an individual is placed at the apex of power, be it by fault of birth as in monarchies, or deific intervention in theocracies, by concerted effort and overthrow via some kind of coup or by the collapse of democratic institutions leading to an intervention in the workings of the state to rescue it from itself, or to carve out a domain from the ruins.\n\nMany schools of thought happily live under the umbrella of §YPaternal Autocracy§! but generally they represent something a bit less shame-faced than pure 'might makes right' whilst still leaning on that when the trappings of social conservatism are unable to do the job. Ultimately what distinguishes a §YPaternal Autocracy§! from an Authoritarian Democracy is the rejection of electoral politics as the means of organizing the transfer of power. What distinguishes it from a National Populist movement is the lack of a radical transformative ideology underpinning their quest for power."

 paternal_autocrat_schleicherism_desc: "März führt zu April (March leads to April), was a common saying in interwar Germany. With the fall of the March Coalition in 1935 and Black Monday in 1936 it seemed that either the radical left or right would size power. However, something that no one could foresee coming happened, the appointment of Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher, 'Der Rote General'. The new Reichskanzler, an ally of the Kronprinz, would lead Germany though the crises of Black Monday, Red Brunswick and the Second Weltkrieg. In each he defeated Syndicalists and Savinkovists alike, taking Germany to her greatest victory, Heimdallr. However, he would not live to see Germany's triumph over the Syndicalists. Now his greatest legacy is the, §Y'Deutsche Nationale Einheitsfront'§!, a large non-partisan organization of Workers, Soldiers and Mitlestandes, leads our nation in ideal democracy unbound to the flaws of liberalism, Populism and Syndicalism."

 ### National Populism ###
 national_populist_subtype_desc: "In the tumultuous years after the Weltkrieg, a new type of political movement was born: §YNational Populism§!. Stemming from anti-establishment, revanchist and far-right anti-socialist schools of thought and first prominent in the Russian Republic with Boris Savinkov's SZRS, National Populist movements adhere to a basic set of ideological tenets: Extreme authoritarianism, ultranationalism, mass political mobilization and working towards a national rebirth.\n\nBelieving that constitutional democracy is obsolete, National Populists advocate for rapid centralization of power under a strong and charismatic leader, with the state having high or total control over the nation and it's economy. In keeping with revanchist sentiments, National Populists promote militarist policies and view violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation, with paramilitary organisations and secret police being common in National Populist states. Though not mandatory, their policies are often influenced by ideas of ethnic supremacy and subjugation. National Populists can be either monarchist or republican in nature, though they will oppose any institution that hampers their ability to transform the state."

 national_populist_fundamentalism_desc: "$national_populist_subtype_desc$"
 national_populist_ultranationalism_desc: "$national_populist_subtype_desc$"
 national_populist_savinkovism_desc: "§YNatsionalnoye Narodnichestvo§!, literally translating to National Populism, and colloquially referred to as §YSavinkovism§! is a revolutionary ideology opposed to Bolshevik socialism and the conservative liberalism that dominated post-Civil War Russia. Savinkovism rejects "unstable" parliamentary democracy and instead stands for a totalitarian dictatorship led by a supreme leader, a Vozhd, who is afforded supreme control over the state to "renew" the nation with the assistance of secret police and violent paramilitaries. Ideologically, Savinkovism is a synthesis of the radical peasant Narodnik movement and the White movement's militarist nationalism, united behind a message of expansionist irredentism. This rampant expansionism is tied to a generally civic nationalism, with so-called "loyal minorities" afforded the same rights as ethnic Russians, though this policy is criticized by Russian chauvinists within the movement. Savinkovist messaging is populist and anti-elite, making a clean break with traditional aristocratic monarchism. Still, Savinkovism is socially conservative, with connections to the Orthodox Church and promoting traditional gender roles.\n\nEconomically, Savinkovism is relatively vague. While being anti-syndicalist yet supporting the Artel system, it aims for state control, mass industrialization and land reform with mechanization to uplift the Russian peasantry. Overall this programme is termed "Voskhod", or Sunrise, and had the chief aim of preparing Russia for war. That said, Savinkovism is economically flexible and policy shifted numerous times to maximize effectiveness and productivity.\n\nWith Savinkovism's meteoric rise, its ideological tenets have inspired and informed a whole school of far-right movements across the world that are uniformly attributed with the National Populist label."
