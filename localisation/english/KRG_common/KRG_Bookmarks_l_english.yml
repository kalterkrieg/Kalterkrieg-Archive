KRG_SCENARIO_NAME: "End of the Weltkrieg" 
KRG_SCENARIO_DESC: "War is hell. But the Kalte Krieg isn't about war -- it's about preventing it. As the world freezes over, covered by the cold corpses of its doomed inhabitants, we remember that the heat of mankind can only be smothered by the heat of our own creation. As long as the heart of humanity beats, its fire burns. But lest we forget; the fire of the atom burns brighter..."

##German Empire##
GER_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§GGermany has full content to 1956§!\nThe Kaiserreich once stood as the true hegemon of Europe, a power that stretched continents, finally gaining its place in the sun. However, this was two decades ago. The Kaiserreich today is an empire which has paid a bitter price for victory. A nation plagued by wartime devestation, it's stability has been laid in a fragile military regime forged by the Enabling Act. Heimdallr brought victory in Europe, but incompetence lost the Far East. With the Free World stretching its power across the Atlantic, and the Atomic Age beginning, time will tell if the Kaiserreich can truly win its greatest war - the peace..."

##Canada##
CAN_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§GCanada has full content to 1956§!\nLooking back at Canadian history, it seemed surreal for it be leading the Free World, and to be a global superpower to inevitably rival the Kaiserreich. However, as history has shown, the impossible can happen. Canada is one of the largest nations on the planet, in terms of land mass and in all aspects of economy and military. Intervention in the 2nd American Civil War and the 2nd Weltkrieg has enabled a \"Golden Age\" bringing Canada to the forefront of global politics and foreign affairs. Now Canada is at a crossroads, will it achieve its dream of a \"Canadian Century\"? Or perish like all who defy the Kaiser..."

##Russian State##
RUS_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KRussia only has partial content§!\nReactionary, Revanchist, Resurgent. These are the only words that can describe the Russian State. It has been ten years since Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was declared Vozhd of Russia, and in that time his armies restored the old Imperial borders in Central Asia and the Kavkaz. Russia's participation in the 2nd Weltkrieg ended in a painful stalemate with the German Empire. The Vozhd grows old at the reins of a discontented, wounded, and bitter nation. Plotters scheme in the shadows, and there may not be enough secret policemen. Will the Vozhd reign eternal? Or will winds of change sweep the steppes?"

##Danubian Federation##
DNF_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§GDanubia has full content to 1956§!\nThe Danubian Federation is simultaneously one of Europe's youngest countries and one of its oldest. A nation of contrasts, they joined the 2nd Weltkrieg on the German side and swung the tide of the war in favour of the beleagured Kaiserreich. Free, democratic and almost wholly unscathed by the war, Danubia continues to remain decisive in Europe. A number of questions stand about Danubia's future, whether it will remain close to Berlin, forge it's own path on the world stage, or perhaps collapse into ignominy and faction."

##Empire of Japan##
JAP_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§RJapanese content coming soon!§!\nThe last empire of the Far East, Japan now faces its greatest trials. While the Empire quashed the European imperialists in Asia, final victory was stolen away in a failed war in China. With this humiliating defeat, Japan's political structures were forced to change to survive. Known as the Minsekai, this political evolution aimed to unite the Empire and quash factionalism. They failed. Now the Kokkai is plagued with rival factions ready to strike at one another; and a secret movement grows, ready to act once the house of cards has collapsed. The Empire walks a knife's edge, the Pacific in the balance..."

##United Kingdom##
ENG_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§OGreat Britain only has opening content§!\nFollowing the German atomic bombing of Portsmouth, Edward VIII has returned to London as King, fulfilling the promise he made when he took the crown. However, the Restoration is anything but secure. Syndicalist militias still hold out, with guerrilas fighting across the country. Britain's industrial might lies obliterated by massive bombing campaigns, the people starving following the years of blockade, and a German army stands steadfast in the South. Prime Minister Anthony Eden has been given the monumental task of rebuilding a broken nation. Will he succeed or will Britain fall into chaos?"

## Mittelafrika ## 
MAF_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KMittelafrika only has partial content§!\nAs Germany plunged into the most catastrophic war in decades, there remained but one corner of its Empire left untouched by the syndicalist menace; The great Mittelafrikan project. An already overstretched administration recovering from the disastrous reign of Karl Ritter now had to support an ailing Fatherland, with forecasts painting a grim future. It was only through the merits of the pragmatic Fritz Thyssen that the colony survived, straddling the line between preservation and destruction. With the War now over, Thyssen must now face the future and a cold war in which his colony will play a crucial role..."

##American Union State##
TEX_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KThe Union State only has partial content§!\nInternational onlookers were shocked by the news. The Union State had triumphed over both the Syndicalists and Federalists in the 2nd American Civil War. But harmony was not found as after their victory, the Union State was thrown into chaos. The assassination of President Huey Long and the failed Silver Legion coup left the nation divided. The Union State is now led by Earl Long, whose weak Presidency has shredded the unity of the America First Party. By 1948, the Union State still struggles to rebuild, besieged by rebellious elements, and has a house divided in claims to who is heir to Huey's legacy. Many in America now ask themselves: Is this what Huey wanted?"

##New England ##
NEE_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§GNew England has full content to 1956§!\nOnce seen as a North American backwater, Boston is now ready to step onto the world stage. The industrial powerhouse behind the Canadian invasions of France, Ireland and Britain, the Republic of New England is now poised to become a power in her own right. Buoyed by the conquest of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, the nation has surpassed the Pacific States in economic strength, and is not far behind the American Union State. The partnership between Canada and New England is now set to enter its second decade. As the NATO agreement is ready to redefine North America, will New England embrace its destiny as a world power?"

##Nord France ##
FRA_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§ONorth France only has opening content§!\nThe Second Weltkrieg came home to roost in North France. The landscape is barren, with cities that are strewn with destroyed buildings and destroyed military vehicles standing aside crossroads that had been held by diehard syndicalist divisions. Those who have not died have gone to ground and still occasionally cause trouble. Aside from the simmering resentment of the revolutionaries however, the people are mostly so ground down as to allow the country to be called pacified. Paris still retains a faded grandeur, and ambitious collaborators flock there to find roles in whatever government may come once von Bock leaves."

##Australasia##
AST_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§OAustralasian only has opening content!§!\nAll is not well in the land down under. While no bombs, nor enemy troops' boots fell upon its shores, the Second Weltkrieg brought many changes to the young nation. From the economic boom after Black Monday to the seizure of Germany's former South Pacific holdings, the war ended well for the nation. Internally tensions are reaching a boiling point, with repressive action against labour unions, the New Zealand independence movement, demobilisation of the armed forces and a looming economic downturn leaving many in the nation worried for the future. The upcoming election decides Australasia's future, but what future will that be?"

##Guangzhou Government##
CHI_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§RSouth Chinese content coming soon!§!\nFirst as a makeshift alliance of desperate revolutionaries, the Guangzhou Government, formally known as the South China Political Council, is at its crossroads. The collapse of the 3rd Internationale and the USA destroyed the beacon of hope afar. The old scars resurfaced following the temporary disappearance of a common enemy. Sinking further into the miserable abyss of old while fearing the archenemy across the sea sharpening its sword, the long-suffering people could wait no longer. To where the Chinese revolution is heading in this era of turbulence? Is there a ray of hope for this broken ancient nation?"

##Beiyang Government##
FNG_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§RNorth Chinese content coming soon!§!\nSince 1911, 'heritage' has been central to political debate in China. For China's rightful leader, Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the heritage was grave: the image of a brutal warlord, the heaviest fragment of a shattered nation, the dishonorable history of treason, the might of China's most powerful army, and the heavy moral responsibility brought forth by a pyrrhic victory. His demise spurred a gathering storm above Beijing, as the despised heir, the ambitious Crown Prince, and the cruel inquisitor are all eyeing the Old Marshal's heritage. When the day of reckoning comes, there can only be one victor. After the dust settles, what heritage will China's new master leave for the future?"


##ARG Africa## 
ARG_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§RArgentine content coming soon!§!\nArgentina is strong! Argentina is proud! Argentina is master of her own fate! Ruler of the Conosur!... \n\nArgentina has no idea what to do with herself anymore.\n\nThe Presidency of Manuel Domecq Garcia has thus been one of merely keeping the ship steered in the same course, with little support from his own armed forces or populace. But there are storms on the horizon and not all is well in South America. These political fossils will no doubt struggle to survive much longer."

##South Africa## ##TODO
SAF_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§RSouth African content coming soon!§!"

##Italy## ##TODO
ITA_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KItaly only has partial content§!\n\nUnified after a bloody civil war, and forced to have Veneto demilitarised to avoid Danubian intervention, the Kingdom of Italy has become one of the Accord's bulwarks in Italy. But not all is well in Italian politics, and despite a referendum on the Monarchy in 1945, the matter is not settled just yet."

### Pacific States of America ###
CAL_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KPacific America only has partial content§!\nThe American Nightmare was viewed with horror and despair from the heart of the Pacific, seeing the East tear itself apart and send millions of young Americans to their deaths, while the West weathered the storm in relative security. Now, while America sets its sights on rebuilding, the Pacific States maintains the torch of liberty, eyeing their neighbour with suspicion. Her soldiers guard the passes in the Rocky Mountains, while her diplomats reach out abroad and in the other enclaves to build up a counter to the Union State. Time will only tell if the lights of this city on a hill will burn on through the night, or if it will fizzle out from torrential assault by tyranny..."

### South France (French Republic) ###
NFA_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§KSouth France only has partial content§!\nFrance is in the midst of her greatest struggle. Just years ago, the true French Republic was confined to her remaining colonies; she was a shell of her former self. With the collapse of the Commune in 1945, celebration rang out in France, from the Europeans who had longed to return home and the natives who still seek to self determination. With some diplomatic pressure, the Entente secured the South of France for the Republic! As the second strongest member of the Entente, the Mediterranean hegemon must maintain its status and power over the region lest it fall to the Reichspakt. But she has an uphill struggle, and the natives are restless."

### Irish Republic ###
IRE_KRG_KALTERKRIEG_DESC: "§OIreland only has opening content§!\nThe Irish Republic is a Presidential Republic in north-western Europe, encompassing the island of Ireland. President Richard Mulcahy was elected in 1947 after Ireland's liberation by the Entente. The nation leans toward authoritarianism, with the president presently wielding near-dictatorial power. Politically aligned with the Reichspakt and a member of Mitteleuropa, its primary domestic concerns include the aftermath of the second British occupation and the status of Northern Ireland within the state."
