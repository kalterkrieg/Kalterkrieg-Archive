terrain_san_marino_socialist: "Socialist Republic of San Marino\n§W--------------§!\n§LCurrent ruling party:§!\n§RUnione Sindacale Sammarinese (Radical Socialist)\n§!§W--------------§!\n§LThe Socialist Republic of San Marino is the last living remnant of the Third Internationale. In 1919, San Marino was going through deep political infighting between the conservative-liberal Unione Democratica Sammarinese and the socialist Partito Socialista Sammarinese. As the Socialist Party autonomously established a Chamber of Labour in late 1919, their maximalist current broke off and subsequently toppled the General Council in the spring of 1920, with help from the Italian syndicalists. Reformed along syndicalist guidelines with the Chamber of Labour acting as a new General Council and with the radical socialists reforming as the Sammarinese Syndicalist Union, the new Socialist Republic of San Marino became the most proud and close ally of the Socialist Republic of Italy, being a sister republic up to the middle of the Second Weltkrieg. When the Socialist Republic of Italy capitulated, San Marino stood in place, with the Syndicalist republic persisting as the last bastion of Syndicalism in continental Europe.\nAs Italian troops reached Sammarinese territory, the Syndicalist government would cede to their pressure and agree to hold free elections, ensuring the country wouldn't be invaded. Surprising most, the Syndicalist government would go on to win the 1945 Elections: the Kingdom of Italy would recognise the results of the elections as legitimate and establish relations with San Marino, guaranteeing the continued survival of the Socialist Republic.§!"
terrain_san_marino_basic: "Most Serene Republic of San Marino\n§W--------------§!\n§LCurrent ruling party:§!\n§BPartito Democratico Cristiano Sammarinese (Social Conservative)\n§!§W--------------§!\n§LThe Most Serene Republic of San Marino is, according to some, the oldest nation in the world, being traditionally founded in 301. The state was ruled by a noble oligarchy until 1906, when the Arengo was formed and national elections held; but this young democracy was still deeply influenced by the nobility and their Sammarinese Democratic Union, a counterpart to the Italian Liberal Party. This would result in a revolution in the spring of 1920.\n\nAfter more than 3 decades, the Syndicalist government has been toppled after a period of civil unrest and a defeat in the 1955 Elections. With the Christian Democrats coming to power for the first time, San Marino has experienced another major political shift; however, unlike in 1920, it seems that the opposition will be allowed a place in the country, as a fully democratic and legal opposition.§!"

italyrep_san_marino.1.t: "1955 Elections Held in San Marino"
italyrep_san_marino.1.d: "Even after the fall of the Third Internationale, the small country of San Marino has maintained an openly syndicalist administration, despite our diplomatic pressures, with the Unione Sindacale Sammarinese winning an absolute majority in the free elections we imposed after the fall of the Socialist Republic of Italy. However, ever since the 1945 elections, the support for the Syndicalist government has begun to wear off in San Marino, with the USS barely managing to gain a majority in 1950.\n\nToday, the 1955 elections have been held in Mount Titano; and to the astonishment of most, they resulted in a perfect split between the Christian Democrats and the Syndicalists in the Chamber of Labour. Chairman Giacomini now faces the prospect of a minority government; with the Christian Democrats unwilling to compromise with the Syndicalists, it is uncertain how long this can last."
italyrep_san_marino.1.a: "A spiky situation"

italyrep_san_marino.2.t: "A Sammarinese Provisional Government"
italyrep_san_marino.2.d: "Following the 1955 elections, the Sammarinese Chairman Giordano Giacomini has sought to govern without consulting the Chamber of Labour, de facto ruling by decree. The Christian Democrats have contested this decision, though the perfect split in the Chamber meant that nobody had the power to break the stalemate. At least, until this month.\n\nWith Giacomini's term as Chairman nearing its end, the Chairman hoped to play for time, until the Christian Democrats would eventually agree to cooperate with his government. However, this has had the opposite effect.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the reformist-leaning side of the USS split off to form the Sammarinese Socialist Democratic Party, or PSDS, immediately aligning with the Christian Democrats. This strenghtened the position of the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party, which immediately demanded Giacomini step down and allow the election of a new Chairman.\n\nAs Giacomini tried to defuse the situation, the Christian Democrats decided to end their collaboration with the Socialist Republic, and fled to Rovereta near the Italian border where they proclaimed the birth of the 'Provisional Government of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino'. In the meantime, the USS organised a Volunteers' Militia, to hold out against the revolters.\n\nWith civil war on the horizon, our government must take a stance, in order to restore stability in Mount Titano... or bring a definitive end to this holdout of the Third International."

italyrep_san_marino.3.t: "The Sammarinese Gendarmerie Restores Order"
italyrep_san_marino.3.d: "Our plea for peace had virtually no effect in San Marino, as equipment and volunteers flooded the country. Syndicalist sympathisers from our own Republic entered the Volunteers' Militia, while some conservative power brokers supplied the Provisional Government with arms and money.\n\nYesterday evening, the situation turned violent, as a small regiment loyal to the USS, made up mostly of Italian citizens, assaulted the Provisional Government forces; as news spread that there had been several wounded and even a few deaths in the confrontation, Ettore Sozzi, commander of the Sammarinese Gendarmerie, decided to intervene. Commander Sozzi and the Sammarinese Gendarmerie then proceded to forcefully disband the Government and the Chamber of Labour, forming a provisional Junta. In the morning, Sozzi formally ceded the reins of government to the Provisional Government, restoring the Most Serene Republic of San Marino together with its Regency and its General Council, and bringing an end to the last bastion of the Third Internationale."
italyrep_san_marino.3.a: "A sad resolution"

italyrep_san_marino.4.t: "The Regents Cave In"
italyrep_san_marino.4.d: "With our government formally recognising the Provisional Government as the rightful governing body of San Marino, and the prospect of an imminent civil war and Italian invasion, the USS rapidly collapsed.\n\nYesterday evening, the Chairman of the Socialist Republic of San Marino formally resigned, with the head of the Gendarmerie Commander Sozzi becoming the interim Chairman and disbanding the Volunteers' Militia.\n\nIn the morning, Sozzi formally ceded the reins of government to the Provisional Government, restoring the Most Serene Republic of San Marino together with its Regency and its General Council, and bringing an end to the last bastion of the Third Internationale."
italyrep_san_marino.4.a: "Peace returns to Mount Titano"

italyrep_san_marino.5.t: "Tanks on Mount Titano"
italyrep_san_marino.5.d: "Our armed intervention in San Marino has, to put it mildly, escalated the situation in the country. With open fighting breaking out between the two forces, there already were dozens of dead and houndreds of wounded on both sides as our divisions reached the city of San Marino. Unable to flee, the Chairman of San Marino was captured by our forces and handed over to the Provisional Government, together with his government and most of the USS leadership.\n\nWith the PDCS having taken over the country, the Regency and the Grand Council have been restored as the country is to transition back to being the Most Serene Republic of San Marino. The Provisional Government has also called for new elections, hoping to heal the internal divisions that led to this civil war, though the compromised position of the USS makes a PDCS victory certain."
italyrep_san_marino.5.a: "What else did we expect?"

italyrep_san_marino.6.t: "Bloodshed in San Marino"
italyrep_san_marino.6.d: "The recent 1955 elections had been reason for much distress in the small Socialist Republic of San Marino, as the ruling Syndicalist Union and the Christian Democratic Party came to a standstill. Due to this, the Chairman ignored the incoming end of his term in office, ruling by decree to avoid the gridlocked Chamber of Labour; however, this caused a split in the Syndicalist Union, with pro-democracy deputies leaving the party altogether and siding with the Christian Democrats. This led to the opposition leaving the Chamber of Labour, and forming a provisional government near the Italian border. The rightist government of the Italian Republic has seized the chance to get rid of this last remnant of the Third Internationale, and intervened in the subsequent civil war.\nThe Italian intervention has received widespread condemnation from the Accord, seeing the intervention as an unlawful invasion of a sovereign country. Whatever the case, the Christian Democrats now rule in San Marino, after a brief struggle that cost dozens of lives, and that spelled a definitive end to the Third Internationale and to orthodox Syndicalism in continental Europe."

With attacking forces overpowering the defences set up outside of the city, the Roman HQ chose to relocate near the former Papal border to avoid being encircled or having to fight through the Urbe.\n\nThis marks a great shift in the dynamics of diplomacy: as much as [2.owner.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] may condemn the move, losing the Capital means they will no longer have the upper hand at the negotiating table."

Expecting only light resistance, the attackers were caught off-guard by the defending forces, and were forced to withdraw after a brief shootout.\n\nThe move has attracted the condemnation of the government in [2.owner.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]; however, the volatile situation in Latium means it might only be a matter of time before another attack is attempted."
